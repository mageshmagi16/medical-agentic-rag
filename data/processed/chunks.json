The new journal is designed to promote better patient care by serving the expanded needs of all health professionals committed to the care of patients with diabetes. As such, the American Diabetes Association views Diabetes Care as a reaffirmation of Francis Weld Peabody's contention that \u201cthe secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\u201d \u2014Norbert Freinkel, Diabetes Care, January-February 1978 EDITOR IN CHIEF Steven E.

Gabbay, on behalf of the American Diabetes Association Diabetes is a complex, chronic condition requiring continuous medical care with multifactorial risk-reduction strategies be- yond glucose management. Ongoing dia- betes self-management education and support are critical to empowering peo- ple, preventing acute complications, and reducing the risk of long-term complica- tions. Signi\ufb01cant evidence exists that supports a range of interventions to im- prove diabetes outcomes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) \u201cStandards of Care in Diabetes,\u201d referred to here as the Standards of Care, is in- tended to provide clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and other interested indi- viduals with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care. The ADA Professional Practice Com- mittee (PPC) updates the Standards of Care annually and strives to include dis- cussion of emerging clinical considerations in the text, and as evidence evolves, clini- cal guidance is added to the recommen- dations in the Standards of Care.

More informa- tion on the \u201cLiving Standards\u201d can be found on the ADA professional website DiabetesPro at professional.diabetes.org/ content-page/living-standards. The Stand- ards of Care supersedes all previously published ADA position statements\u2014and the recommendations therein\u2014on clini- cal topics within the purview of the Standards of Care; while still containing valuable analysis, ADA position state- ments should not be considered the cur- rent position of the ADA. The Standards of Care receives annual review and ap- proval by the ADA Board of Directors and is reviewed by ADA staff and clinical lead- ership. The Standards of Care also under- goes external peer review annually. SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES The recommendations in the Standards of Care include screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect health outcomes of people with diabetes. They also cover the prevention, screening, di- agnosis, and management of diabetes- associated complications and comorbid- ities. The recommendations encompass care throughout the lifespan, for youth (children aged birth to 11 years and ado- lescents aged 12\u201317 years), adults (aged 18\u201364 years), and older adults (aged $65 years). The recommendations cover the management of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other types of diabetes.

TARGET AUDIENCE The target audience for the Standards of Care includes primary care physicians, en- docrinologists, nurse practitioners, physi- cian associates/assistants, pharmacists, dietitians, and diabetes care and education specialists. The Standards of Care also pro- vides guidance to specialists caring for peo- ple with diabetes and its multitude of complications, such as cardiologists, neph- rologists, emergency physicians, internists, pediatricians, psychologists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, and podiatrists. Addi- tionally, these recommendations help payers, policy makers, researchers, re- search funding organizations, and advo- cacy groups to align their policies and resources and deliver optimal care for people living with diabetes. The ADA strives to improve and up- date the Standards of Care to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policy makers can continue to rely on it as the most authoritative source for cur- rent guidelines for diabetes care. The Standards of Care recommendations are not intended to preclude clinical judgment. They must be applied in the context of excellent clinical care, with adjustments for individual preferences, comorbidities, and other patient factors. For more detailed information about the management of diabetes, please refer to Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes (1) and Medical Management of Type 2 Diabetes (2).

Professional Practice Committee The PPC of the ADA is responsible for the Standards of Care. The PPC is a multidisci- plinary expert committee comprising physi- cians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, diabetes care and education specialists, registered dietitian nutritionists, behavioral health scientists, and others who have ex- pertise in a range of areas including but not limited to adult/pediatric endocri- nology, epidemiology, public health, behavioral health, cardiovascular risk management, microvascular complica- tions, nephrology, neurology, ophthal- mology, podiatry, clinical pharmacology, preconception and pregnancy care, weight management and diabetes prevention, and use of technology in diabetes man- agement. Appointment to the PPC is based on excellence in clinical practice and research, with attention to appropri- ate representation of members based on considerations including but not limited to demographic, geographic, work setting, or identity characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic- ity, ability level).

A guideline methodologist (R.R.B. for the 2023 Standards of Care) with expertise and training in evidence- based medicine and guideline develop- ment methodology oversees all methodo- logical aspects of the development of the Standards of Care and serves as a statisti- cal analyst. Disclosure and Duality of Interest Management All members of the expert panel (the PPC members, ad hoc members, and subject matter experts) and ADA staff are re- quired to comply with the ADA policy on duality of interest, which requires disclo- sure of any \ufb01nancial, intellectual, or other interests that might be construed as con- stituting an actual, potential, or apparent con\ufb02ict, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. For transparency, ADA re- quires full disclosure of all relationships. Full disclosure statements from all com- mittee members are solicited and re- viewed during the appointment process. Disclosures are then updated throughout the guideline development process (speci\ufb01cally before the start of every meeting), and disclosure state- ments are submitted by every Stand- ards of Care author upon submission of the revised Standards of Care section.

In addi- tion, the ADA adheres to Section 7 of the Council for Medical Specialty Societies \u201cCode for Interactions with Companies\u201d (3). The duality of interest review group also ensures the majority of the PPC and the PPC chair are without potential con- \ufb02ict relevant to the subject area. Further- more, the PPC chair is required to remain uncon\ufb02icted for 1 year after the publica- tion of the Standards of Care. Members of the committee who disclose a poten- tial duality of interest pertinent to any speci\ufb01c recommendation are prohibited from participating in discussions related to those recommendations. No expert panel members were employees of any pharmaceutical or medical device com- pany during the development of the 2023 Standards of Care.

In con- sultation with a systematic review expert, each subcommittee devises and executes systematic literature searches. For the 2023 Standards of Care, PubMed, Med- line, and EMBASE were searched for the time periods of 1 June 2021 to 26 July 2022. Searches are limited to studies pub- lished in English. Subcommittee members also manually search journals, reference lists of conference proceedings, and regu- latory agency websites. All potentially rel- evant citations are then subjected to a full-text review. In consultation with the methodologist, the subcommittees pre- pare the evidence summaries and grading for each section of the Standards of Care. All PPC members discuss and review the evidence summaries and make revisions as appropriate. The \ufb01nal evidence sum- maries are then deliberated on by the PPC, and the recommendations that will appear in the Standards of Care are drafted. Grading of Evidence and Recommendation Development A grading system (Table 1) developed by the ADA and modeled after existing methods is used to clarify and codify the evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations in the Standards of Care. All of the recommendations in the Standards of Care are critical to comprehensive care regardless of rating. ADA recommendations are assigned rat- ings of A, B, or C, depending on the qual- ity of the evidence in support of the recommendation.

Recommen- dations assigned an E level of evidence are informed by key opinion leaders in the \ufb01eld of diabetes (members of the PPC) and cover important elements of clinical care. All Standards of Care recom- mendations receive a rating for the strength of the evidence and not for the strength of the recommendation. Recom- mendations with A-level evidence are based on large, well-designed random- ized controlled trials or well-done meta- analyses of randomized controlled trials. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population for which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. Of course, published evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for people, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the individual person in mind. Indi- vidual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, the values and preferences of the person with diabetes, must be considered and may lead to dif- ferent treatment targets and strategies. Furthermore, conventional evidence hier- archies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss nuances important in dia- betes care. For example, although there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving multiple risk factor control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is dif\ufb01cult to assess each component of such a complex intervention. In preparation",

Revision Process Public comment is particularly impor- tant in the development of clinical practice recommendations; it promotes transparency and provides key stake holders the opportunity to identify and address gaps in care. The ADA holds a year-long public comment period re- questing feedback on the Standards of Care. The PPC reviews compiled feedback from the public in preparation for the an- nual update but considers more pressing updates throughout the year, which may be published as \u201cliving\u201d Standards up- dates. Feedback from the larger clinical community and general public was in- valuable for the revision of the Standards of Care\u20142022. Readers who wish to comment on the 2023 Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional. diabetes.org/SOC. Feedback for the Standards of Care is also obtained from external peer re- viewers. The Standards of Care is re- viewed by ADA clinical leadership and scienti\ufb01c and medical staff and is ap- proved by the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and lay people.

The ADA Standards of Care is an essential resource for health care pro- fessionals caring for people with diabe- tes. ADA Statements, Consensus Reports, and Scienti\ufb01c Reviews support the rec- ommendations included in the Standards of Care. Standards of Care The annual Standards of Care supplement to Diabetes Care contains the of\ufb01cial ADA position, is authored by the ADA, and provides all of the ADA\u2019s current clinical practice recommendations. ADA Statement An ADA statement is an of\ufb01cial ADA point of view or belief that does not contain clinical practice recommenda- tions and may be issued on advocacy, policy, economic, or medical issues re- lated to diabetes. ADA statements un- dergo a formal review process, including a review by the appropriate ADA national committee, ADA clinical leadership, sci- ence and health care staff, and the ADA Board of Directors. Consensus Report A consensus report on a particular topic contains a comprehensive examination, is authored by an expert panel (i.e., con- sensus panel), and represents the panel\u2019s collective analysis, evaluation, and opin- ion.

Gabbay, on behalf of the American Diabetes Association GENERAL CHANGES The \ufb01eld of diabetes care is rapidly chang- ing as new research, technology, and treatments that can improve the health and well-being of people with diabetes continue to emerge. With annual updates since 1989, the American Diabetes Associ- ation (ADA) has long been a leader in pro- ducing guidelines that capture the most current state of the \ufb01eld. The 2023 Standards of Care includes revisions to incorporate person-\ufb01rst and inclusive language. Efforts were made to consistently apply terminology that empowers people with diabetes and recognizes the individual at the center of diabetes care. Although levels of evidence for several recommendations have been updated, these changes are not outlined below where the clinical recommendation has remained the same. That is, changes in evidence level from, for example, E to C are not noted below. The 2023 Standards of Care contains, in addition to many minor changes that clarify recommendations or re\ufb02ect",

Recommendation 11.5b also recom- mends that sodium\u2013glucose cotrans- porter 2 inhibitor might also be effective in people with urinary albumin of normal to $200 mg/g creatinine, but this is B level at this time, as the study reporting this has not been published. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are now recommended along with other medications for cardiovascular and kid- ney protection rather than as alternatives when other treatments have not been effective. Recommendation 11.8 addressing re- ferral to a nephrologist was expanded to include referrals for continuously increas- ing urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and/or for continuously decreasing esti- mated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.

With such an integrated approach in mind, the Ameri- can Diabetes Association (ADA) highlights the importance of patient-centered care, de\ufb01ned as care that considers individual patient comorbidities and prognoses; is respectful of and responsive to patient preferences, needs, and values; and en- sures that patient values guide all clinical decisions (2). Furthermore, social deter- minants of health (SDOH)\u2014often out of direct control of the individual and poten- tially representing lifelong risk\u2014contribute to health care and psychosocial outcomes and must be addressed to improve all health outcomes (3). Clinical practice rec- ommendations, whether based on evi- dence or expert opinion, are intended to guide an overall approach to care. The science and art of health care come together when the clinician makes treat- ment decisions for a patient who may not meet the eligibility criteria used in the studies on which guidelines are based. Recognizing that one size does not \ufb01t all, the standards presented here provide guidance for when and how to adapt recommendations for an individual. This section provides guidance for health care professionals as well as health sys- tems and policymakers. Care Delivery Systems The proportion of people with diabetes who achieve recommended A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol levels has \ufb02uctuated over the years (4).

However, only 23% met targets for glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol measures while also avoiding smoking (4). The mean A1C nationally among people with diabetes increased slightly from 7.3% in 2005\u20132008 to 7.5% in 2013\u20132016 based on the National Health and Nutrition Ex- amination Survey (NHANES), with youn- ger adults, women, and non-Hispanic Black individuals less likely to meet treatment targets (4). Certain segments of the population, such as young adults and individuals with complex comorbid- ities, \ufb01nancial or other social hardships, and/or limited English pro\ufb01ciency, face particular challenges to goal-based care (5\u20137). Even after adjusting for these patient factors, the persistent variability in the quality of diabetes care across health care professionals and prac- tice settings indicates that substan- tial system-level improvements are still needed. Diabetes poses a signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial burden to individuals and society. It is es- timated that the annual cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in 2017 was $327 bil- lion, including $237 billion in direct health care costs and $90 billion in reduced pro- ductivity. After adjusting for in\ufb02ation, the economic costs of diabetes increased by 26% from 2012 to 2017 (8). This is attrib- uted to the increased prevalence of dia- betes and the increased cost per person with diabetes. Therefore, on going popu- lation health strategies are needed to re- duce costs and provide optimized care. Chronic Care Model",

However, a major barrier to optimal care is a delivery system that is often fragmented, lacks clinical infor- mation capabilities, duplicates services, and is poorly designed for the coordi- nated delivery of chronic care. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) takes these factors into consideration and is an effec- tive framework for improving the quality of diabetes care (9). Six Core Elements. The CCM includes six core elements to optimize the care of people with chronic disease: 1. Delivery system design (moving from a reactive to a proactive care deliv- ery system where planned visits are coordinated through a team-based approach) 2. Self-management support 3. Decision support (basing care on evi- dence-based, effective care guidelines) 4.

Health systems (to create a quality- oriented culture) A 5-year effectiveness study of the CCM in 53,436 people with type 2 diabe- tes in the primary care setting suggested that the use of this model of care delivery reduced the cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications and all- cause mortality (10).

Rede\ufb01ning the roles of the health care delivery team and empowering patient self-management are fundamental to the successful implementation of the CCM (12). Collaborative, multidisciplinary teams are best suited to provide care for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and to facilitate patients\u2019 self-management (13\u201315). There are references to guide the implementation of the CCM into diabetes care delivery, including opportunities and challenges (16). Strategies for System-Level Improvement Optimal diabetes management requires an organized, systematic approach and the involvement of a coordinated team of dedicated health care professionals working in an environment where patient- centered, high-quality care is a priority (7,16,17). While many diabetes care pro- cesses have improved nationally in the past decade, the overall quality of care for people with diabetes remains subop- timal (4). Efforts to increase the quality of diabetes care include providing care that is concordant with evidence-based guidelines (18); expanding the role of teams to implement more intensive dis- ease management strategies (7,19,20); tracking medication-taking behavior at a systems level (21); redesigning the orga- nization of the care process (22); imple- menting electronic health record tools (23,24); empowering and educating patients (25,26); removing \ufb01nancial barriers and reducing patient out-of- pocket costs for diabetes education, eye exams, diabetes technology, and necessary medications (7); assessing and addressing psychosocial issues (27,28); diabetesjournals.org/care Improving Care and Promoting Health in Populations S11 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The National Diabetes Education Program maintains an online resource (cdc.gov/ diabetes/professional-info/training.html) to help health care professionals design and implement more effective health care delivery systems for those with dia- betes. Given the pluralistic needs of peo- ple with diabetes and that the constant challenges they experience vary over the course of disease management (complex insulin treatment plans, new technology, etc.), a diverse team with complementary expertise is consistently recommended (30). Care Teams The care team, which centers around the patient, should avoid therapeutic inertia and prioritize timely and appropriate intensi\ufb01cation of behavior change (nutri- tion and physical activity) and/or phar- macologic therapy for patients who have not achieved the recommended meta- bolic targets (31\u201333). Strategies shown to improve care team behavior and thereby catalyze reductions in A1C, blood pressure, and/or LDL cholesterol include engaging in explicit and collaborative goal setting with patients (34,35); integrating evidence-based guidelines and clinical information tools into the process of care (18,36,37); identifying and addressing language, numeracy, or cultural barriers to care (37\u201339); soliciting performance feedback, setting reminders, and provid- ing structured care (e.g., guidelines, formal case management, and patient education resources) (7); and incorporating care management teams including nurses, die- titians, pharmacists, and other health care professionals (19,38).

The American Telemedicine Association de\ufb01nes telemedicine as the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve a patient\u2019s clinical health status. Telehealth includes a growing variety of applications and services using two-way video, smartphones, wireless tools, and other forms of tele- communications technology (40). Often used interchangeably with telemedicine, telehealth describes a broader range of digital health services in health care deliv- ery (41). This includes synchronous, asyn- chronous, and remote patient monitoring. Telehealth should be used comple- mentary to in-person visits to optimize glycemic management in people with unmanaged diabetes (42). Increasingly, evidence suggests that various telehealth modalities may facilitate reducing A1C in people with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care or in addition to usual care (43), and \ufb01ndings suggest that tele- medicine is a safe method of delivering type 1 diabetes care to rural patients (44). For rural populations or those with limited physical access to health care, telemedicine has a growing body of evi- dence for its effectiveness, particularly with regard to glycemic management as measured by A1C (45\u201347). In addition, evidence supports the effectiveness of telehealth in diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia interventions (48) as well as the telehealth delivery of motivational interviewing (49). Interactive strategies that facilitate communication between health care professionals and patients, including the use of web-based portals or text messaging and those that incor- porate medication adjustment, appear more effective.

Telehealth resources can also have a role in ad- dressing the social determinants of health in young adults with diabetes (51). However, limited data are available on the effectiveness across different pop- ulations (52). Behaviors and Well-being Successful diabetes care also requires a systematic approach to supporting patients\u2019 behavior change efforts. High- quality diabetes self-management edu- cation and support (DSMES) has been shown to improve patient self-management, satisfaction, and glucose outcomes. Na- tional DSMES standards call for an inte- grated approach that includes clinical content and skills, behavioral strategies (goal setting, problem-solving), and en- gagement with psychosocial concerns. Increasingly, such support is being ada- pted for online platforms that have the potential to promote patient access to this important resource. These curricu- lums need to be tailored to the needs of the intended populations, including ad- dressing the \u201cdigital divide,\u201d i.e., access to the technology required for imple- mentation (53\u201356).

The cost of insulin has continued to in- crease in recent years for reasons that are not entirely clear. There are recom- mendations from the ADA Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group for ap- proaches to this issue from a systems level (58). Recommendations including concepts such as cost-sharing for insured people with diabetes should be based on the lowest price available, the list price for insulins that closely re\ufb02ects the net price, and health plans that ensure people with diabetes can access insulin without undue administrative burden or excessive cost (58). The cost of medications (not only in- sulin) in\ufb02uences prescribing patterns and medication use because of patient bur- den and lack of secondary payer support (public and private insurance) for effective approved glucose-lowering, cardiovascular disease risk-reducing, and weight man- agement therapeutics. Financial barriers remain a major source of health dispar- ities, and costs should be a focus of treat- ment goals (59). (See TAILORING TREATMENT FOR SOCIAL CONTEXT and TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS.)

Patients who have either private or public in- surance coverage are more likely to meet quality indicators for diabetes care (62). As mandated by the Afford- able Care Act, the Agency for Health- care Research and Quality developed a National Quality Strategy based on tri- ple aims that include improving the health of a population, overall quality and patient experience of care, and per cap- ita cost (63,64). As health care systems and practices adapt to the changing landscape of health care, it will be important to integrate traditional dis- ease-speci\ufb01c metrics with measures of patient experience, as well as cost, in assessing the quality of diabetes care (65,66). Information and guidance spe- ci\ufb01c to quality improvement and prac- tice transformation for diabetes care are available from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Dis- eases guidance on diabetes care and quality (67). Using patient registries and electronic health records, health systems can evaluate the quality of diabetes care being delivered and perform intervention cycles as part of quality improvement strategies (68).

Crit- ical to these efforts is health professional adherence to clinical practice recommen- dations (Table 4.1) and the use of accu- rate, reliable data metrics that include sociodemographic variables to examine health equity within and across popula- tions (71). In addition to quality improvement efforts, other strategies that simulta- neously improve the quality of care and potentially reduce costs are gaining momentum and include reimbursement structures that, in contrast to visit-based billing, reward the provision of appropri- ate and high-quality care to achieve metabolic goals (72), value-based pay- ments, and incentives that accommodate personalized care goals (7,73). (Also see COST CONSIDERATIONS FOR MEDICATION-TAKING BEHAVIORS, above, regarding cost-related barriers to medication use.) TAILORING TREATMENT FOR SOCIAL CONTEXT Recommendations 1.5 Assess food insecurity, housing insecurity/homelessness, \ufb01nancial barriers, and social capital/social community support to inform treatment decisions, with refer- ral to appropriate local commu- nity resources. A 1.6 Provide patients with additional self-management support from lay health coaches, navigators, or community health workers when available. A 1.7 Consider the involvement of com- munity health workers to support the management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, espe- cially in underserved communities and health care systems. B Health inequities related to diabetes and its complications are well docu- mented, are heavily in\ufb02uenced by SDOH, and have been associated with greater risk for diabetes, higher population prev- alence, and poorer diabetes outcomes (74\u201378).

While a comprehensive strategy to reduce diabetes-related health inequi- ties in populations has not been formally studied, general recommendations from other chronic disease management and prevention models can be drawn upon to inform systems-level strategies in dia- betes (83). For example, the National Academy of Medicine has published a framework for educating health care professionals on the importance of SDOH (84). Furthermore, there are re- sources available for the inclusion of stan- dardized sociodemographic variables in electronic health records to facilitate the measurement of health inequities and the impact of interventions designed to reduce those inequities (65,84,85). SDOH are not consistently recognized and often go undiscussed in the clinical encounter (77). Among people with chronic illnesses, two-thirds of those who reported not taking medications as pre- scribed due to cost-related barriers to medication use never shared this with their physician (86).

A recent Canadian study noted an association of one or more ad- verse SDOH and health care utilization and poor diabetes outcomes in high-risk children with type 1 diabetes (86). Another population in which such is- sues must be considered is older adults, where social dif\ufb01culties may impair quality of life and increase the risk of func- tional dependency (87) (see Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for a detailed discussion of social considerations in older adults). Creating systems-level mechanisms to screen for SDOH may help overcome structural barriers and communication gaps between patients and health care professionals (77,88). In addition, brief, validated screening tools for some SDOH exist and could facilitate discussion around factors that signi\ufb01cantly impact treatment during the clinical encounter. Below is a discussion of assessment and treat- ment considerations in the context of food insecurity, homelessness, limited English pro\ufb01ciency, limited health literacy, and low literacy. Food Insecurity Food insecurity is the unreliable avail- ability of nutritious food and the inabil- ity to consistently obtain food without resorting to socially unacceptable practi- ces. Over 18% of the U.S. population re- ported food insecurity between 2005 and 2014 (89). The rate is higher in some racial/ethnic minority groups, including African American and Latino populations, low-income households, and homes diabetesjournals.org/care Improving Care and Promoting Health in Populations S13 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Additionally, the risk for type 2 diabetes is increased twofold in those with food insecurity (81) and has been associated with lower engagement in self-care behaviors and medication use, depression, diabetes distress, and worse glycemic manage- ment when compared with individuals who are food secure (91\u201393). Older adults with food insecurity are more likely to have emergency department visits and hospitalizations compared with older adults who do not report food insecurity (94). Risk for food inse- curity can be assessed with a validated two-item screening tool (95) that in- cludes the following statements: 1) \u201cWithin the past 12 months, we wor- ried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more\u201d and 2) \u201cWithin the past 12 months the food we bought just didn\u2019t last, and we didn\u2019t have money to get more.\u201d An af\ufb01rma- tive response to either statement had a sensitivity of 97% and speci\ufb01city of 83%. Interventions such as food prescription programs are considered promising to address food insecurity by integrating community resources into primary care settings and directly dealing with food de- serts in underserved communities (96,97). Treatment Considerations In those with diabetes and food insecu- rity, the priority is mitigating the increased risk for uncontrolled hyperglycemia and severe hypoglycemia. The reasons for the increased risk of hyperglycemia include the steady consumption of inexpensive carbohydrate-rich processed foods, binge eating, \ufb01nancial constraints to \ufb01lling",

Hypoglycemia can occur due to inadequate or erratic car- bohydrate consumption following the administration of sulfonylureas or insu- lin. See Table 9.2 for drug-speci\ufb01c and patient factors, including cost and risk of hypoglycemia, which may be impor- tant considerations for adults with food insecurity and type 2 diabetes. Health care professionals should consider these factors when making treatment deci- sions for people with food insecurity and seek local resources to help people with diabetes and their family members obtain nutritious food more regularly (98). Homelessness and Housing Insecurity Homelessness/housing insecurity often accompanies many additional barriers to diabetes self-management, including food insecurity, literacy and numeracy de\ufb01ciencies, lack of insurance, cognitive dysfunction, and mental health issues (99). The prevalence of diabetes in the homeless population is estimated to be around 8% (100). Additionally, people with diabetes who are homeless need secure places to keep their diabetes sup- plies and refrigerator access to properly store their insulin and take it on a regu- lar schedule. The risk for homelessness can be ascertained using a brief risk as- sessment tool developed and validated for use among veterans (101). Housing insecurity has also been shown to be directly associated with a person\u2019s ability to maintain their diabetes self-manage- ment (102). Given the potential chal- lenges, health care professionals who care for either homeless or housing- insecure individuals should be familiar with resources or have access to social workers who can facilitate stable",

Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Migrant and seasonal agricultural work- ers may have a higher risk of type 2 dia- betes than the overall population. While migrant farmworker\u2013speci\ufb01c data are lacking, most agricultural workers in the U.S. are Latino, a population with a high rate of type 2 diabetes. In addition, living in severe poverty brings with it food in- security, high chronic stress, and an in- creased risk of diabetes; there is also an association between the use of certain pesticides and the incidence of diabetes (104). Data from the Department of Labor indicate that there are 2.5\u20133 million ag- ricultural workers in the U.S. These agri- cultural workers travel throughout the country, serving as the backbone for a multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. According to 2021 health center data, 175 health centers across the U.S. re- ported that they provided health care services to 893,260 adult agricultural patients, and 91,124 had encounters for diabetes (10.2%) (105). Migrant farmworkers encounter nu- merous and overlapping barriers to re- ceiving care. Migration, which may occur as frequently as every few weeks for farmworkers, disrupts care. In addition, cultural and linguistic barriers, lack of transportation and money, lack of avail- able work hours, unfamiliarity with new communities, lack of access to resour- ces, and other barriers prevent migrant farmworkers from accessing health care. Without regular care, those with diabetes may suffer severe and often expensive complications that affect quality of life.",

For example, if a migrant farmworker with diabetes presents for care, appropriate referrals should be ini- tiated to social workers and community resources, as available, to assist with re- moving barriers to care. Language Barriers Health care professionals who care for non\u2013English speakers should develop or offer educational programs and materi- als in languages speci\ufb01c to these patients with the speci\ufb01c goals of preventing dia- betes and building diabetes awareness in people who cannot easily read or write in English. The National Standards for Cultur- ally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (National CLAS Standards) provide guidance on how health care professionals can reduce language barriers by improving their cultural competency, addressing health literacy, and ensuring communication with language assistance (106). In addi- tion, the National CLAS Standards web- site (thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov) offers several resources and materials that can be used to improve the quality of care delivery to non\u2013English-speaking patients (106). Health Literacy and Numeracy Health literacy is de\ufb01ned as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions (69). Health literacy is strongly associated with patients engaging in complex dis- ease management and self-care (107).

Interven- tions addressing low health literacy in populations with diabetes seem effec- tive in improving diabetes outcomes, in- cluding ones focusing primarily on patient education, self-care training, or disease management. Combining easily adapted materials with formal diabetes education demonstrates effectiveness on clinical and behavioral outcomes in populations with low literacy (108). However, evi- dence supporting these strategies is largely limited to observational studies. More research is needed to investigate the most effective strategies for enhanc- ing both acquisition and retention of di- abetes knowledge and examine different media and strategies for delivering inter- ventions to patients (109). Health numeracy is also essential in diabetes prevention and management. Health numeracy requires primary nu- meric skills, applied health numeracy, and interpretive health numeracy. An emo- tional component also affects a per- son\u2019s ability to understand concepts of risk, probability, and communication of scienti\ufb01c evidence (110). People with pre- diabetes or diabetes often need to per- form numeric tasks such as interpreting food labels and blood glucose levels to make treatment decisions such as medi- cation dosing. Thus, both health literacy and numeracy are necessary for enabling effective communication between patient and health professional, arriving at a treatment plan, and making diabetes self-management task decisions. If pa- tients appear not to understand concepts associated with treatment decisions, both can be assessed using standardized screen- ing measures (111). Adjunctive education and",

Social Capital/Community Support Social capital, which comprises commu- nity and personal network instrumental support, promotes better health, whereas lack of social support is associated with poorer health outcomes in individuals with diabetes (82). Of particular con- cern are the SDOH, including racism and discrimination, which are likely to be lifelong (112). These factors are rarely addressed in routine treatment or disease management but may be underlying reasons for lower engagement in self- care behaviors and medication use. Identi\ufb01cation or development of com- munity resources to support healthy lifestyles is a core element of the CCM (9), with a particular need to incorporate relevant social support networks. There is currently a paucity of evidence regarding enhancing these resources for those most likely to bene\ufb01t from such interven- tion strategies. Health care community linkages are receiving increasing attention from the American Medical Association, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and others to promote the translation of clini- cal recommendations for nutrition and physical activity in real-world settings (113). Community health workers (CHWs) (114), peer supporters (115\u2013117), and lay leaders (118) may assist in the deliv- ery of DSMES services (84,119), particu- larly in underserved communities.

The CHW scope of practice in areas such as outreach and communication, advocacy, social support, basic health education, referrals to community clinics, etc., has successfully provided social and primary preventive services to underserved pop- ulations in rural and hard-to-reach communities. Even though CHWs\u2019 core competencies are not clinical in nature, in some circumstances, clinicians may delegate limited clinical tasks to CHWs. If such is the case, these tasks must al- ways be performed under the direction and supervision of the delegating health professional and following state health care laws and statutes (122,123).

Speci\ufb01c types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syn- dromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic \ufb01brosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treat- ment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation) 4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third tri- mester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation) This section reviews most common forms of diabetes but is not comprehensive. For additional information, see the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position state- ment \u201cDiagnosis and Classi\ufb01cation of Diabetes Mellitus\u201d (1). Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical presentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classi\ufb01cation is impor- tant for determining therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classi\ufb01ed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes only in children are no longer accurate, as both diseases occur in both age groups. Children with type 1 diabetes often present with the hallmark symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and Disclosure information for each author is available at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.

The onset of type 1 diabetes may be more variable in adults; they may not present with the classic symptoms seen in children and may experience temporary remis- sion from the need for insulin (5\u20137). The features most useful in discrimination of type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (<35 years) with lower BMI (<25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and glucose >360 mg/dL (20 mmol/L) at presentation (8). Occa- sionally, people with type 2 diabetes may present with DKA (9,10), particularly members of ethnic and racial minorities (11). It is important for the health care professional to realize that classi\ufb01cation of diabetes type is not always straight- forward at presentation and that mis- diagnosis is common (e.g., adults with type 1 diabetes misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, individuals with maturity- onset diabetes of the young [MODY] misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabe- tes). Although dif\ufb01culties in distinguish- ing diabetes type may occur in all age groups at onset, the diagnosis becomes more obvious over time in people with b-cell de\ufb01ciency as the degree of b-cell de\ufb01ciency becomes clear. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, various genetic and environmental factors can result in the progressive loss of b-cell mass and/or function that manifests clini- cally as hyperglycemia. Once hypergly- cemia occurs, people with all forms of diabetes are at risk for developing the same chronic complications, although rates of progression may differ. The identi\ufb01cation of individualized therapies for",

Across the globe, many groups are working on combining clinical, pathophysiological, and genetic characteristics to more pre- cisely de\ufb01ne the subsets of diabetes that are currently clustered into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomen- clature with the goal of optimizing per- sonalized treatment approaches. Many of these studies show great promise and may soon be incorporated into the diabetes classi\ufb01cation system (13). Characterization of the underlying path- ophysiology is more precisely developed in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabe- tes. It is now clear from prospective stud- ies that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes (14). The rate of progression is dependent on the age at \ufb01rst detection of autoantibody, number of autoantibodies, autoantibody speci\ufb01c- ity, and autoantibody titer. Glucose and A1C levels rise well before the clinical onset of diabetes, making diagnosis feasi- ble well before the onset of DKA. Three distinct stages of type 1 diabetes can be identi\ufb01ed (Table 2.1) and serve as a framework for research and regula- tory decision-making (12,15). There is debate as to whether slowly progressive autoimmune diabetes with an adult on- set should be termed latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1 dia- betes. The clinical priority with detection of LADA is awareness that slow auto- immune b-cell destruction can occur in adults leading to",

For the purpose of this classi\ufb01cation, all forms of diabetes mediated by autoimmune b-cell destruction are included under the rubric of type 1 diabetes. Use of the term LADA is common and acceptable in clinical practice and has the practical impact of heightening awareness of a population of adults likely to have progressive autoimmune b-cell destruc- tion (16), thus accelerating insulin initiation prior to deterioration of glucose manage- ment or development of DKA (6,17). The paths to b-cell demise and dys- function are less well de\ufb01ned in type 2 diabetes, but de\ufb01cient b-cell insulin se- cretion, frequently in the setting of insulin resistance, appears to be the common de- nominator. Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin secretory defects related to genetics, in\ufb02ammation, and metabolic stress. Future classi\ufb01cation schemes for diabetes will likely focus on the patho- physiology of the underlying b-cell dys- function (12,13,18\u201320). DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES Diabetes may be diagnosed based on plasma glucose criteria, either the fast- ing plasma glucose (FPG) value or the 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or A1C criteria (21) (Table 2.2). Generally, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are equally appropriate for diagnostic screening. It should be noted that detection rates of different screening tests vary in both populations and individuals. Moreover, the ef\ufb01cacy of interventions for primary preven- tion of type 2 diabetes has mainly been demonstrated among individuals who have",

Fasting and 2-Hour Plasma Glucose The FPG and 2-h PG may be used to di- agnose diabetes (Table 2.2). The concor- dance between the FPG and 2-h PG tests is imperfect, as is the concordance be- tween A1C and either glucose-based test. Compared with FPG and A1C cut points, the 2-h PG value diagnoses more people with prediabetes and diabetes (27). In people in whom there is discordance between A1C values and glucose values, FPG and 2-h PG are more accurate (28).

However, these ad- vantages may be offset by the lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point, greater cost, limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the de- veloping world, and the imperfect cor- relation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. The A1C test, with a diagnostic threshold of $6.5% (48 mmol/mol), diagnoses only 30% of the diabetes cases identi\ufb01ed collectively using A1C, FPG, or 2-h PG, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (33). Despite these limi- tations with A1C, in 2009, the Interna- tional Expert Committee added A1C to the diagnostic criteria with the goal of in- creased screening (21). When using A1C to diagnose diabetes, it is important to recognize that A1C is an indirect measure of average blood glucose levels and to take other factors into consideration that may impact he- moglobin glycation independently of gly- cemia, such as hemodialysis, pregnancy, HIV treatment (34,35), age, race/ethnicity, genetic background, and anemia/ hemoglobinopathies.

Race/Ethnicity/Hemoglobinopathies Hemoglobin variants can interfere with the measurement of A1C, although most assays in use in the U.S. are unaffected by the most common variants. Marked discrepancies between measured A1C and plasma glucose levels should prompt consideration that the A1C assay may not be reliable for that individual. For individuals with a hemoglobin variant but normal red blood cell turnover, such as those with the sickle cell trait, an A1C as- say without interference from hemoglo- bin variants should be used. An updated list of A1C assays with interferences is available at ngsp.org/interf.asp. African American individuals heterozy- gous for the common hemoglobin vari- ant HbS may have, for any given level of mean glycemia, lower A1C by about 0.3% compared with those without the trait (37). Another genetic variant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of African Amer- ican individuals, was associated with a decrease in A1C of about 0.8% in homo- zygous men and 0.7% in homozygous women compared with those without the variant (38). For example, in Tanza- nia, where there is a high likelihood of hemoglobinopathies in people with HIV, A1C may be lower than expected based on glucose, limiting its usefulness",

For example, African American individu- als may have higher A1C levels than non-Hispanic White individuals with simi- lar fasting and post\u2013glucose load glucose levels (43). Though con\ufb02icting data exist, African American individuals may also have higher levels of fructosamine and glycated albumin and lower levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, suggesting that their glycemic burden (particularly postprandi- ally) may be higher (44,45). Similarly, A1C levels may be higher for a given mean glucose concentration when measured with continuous glucose monitoring (46). A recent report in Afro-Caribbean people demonstrated a lower A1C than predicted by glucose lev- els (47). Despite these and other reported differences, the association of A1C with risk for complications appears to be similar in African American and non- Hispanic White populations (42,48). In the Taiwanese population, age and sex have been reported to be associ- ated with increased A1C in men (49); the clinical implications of this \ufb01nding are unclear at this time.

Confirming the Diagnosis Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis (e.g., patient in a hyperglycemic crisis or with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose $200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]), diagnosis requires two abnormal screening test results, either from the same sample (57) or in two separate test samples. If using two sepa- rate test samples, it is recommended that the second test, which may either be a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed without delay. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), the diagnosis of diabetes is con\ufb01rmed. If two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic threshold when analyzed from the same sample or in two different test samples, this also con\ufb01rms the diagnosis. On the other hand, if a patient has discordant results from two different tests, then the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, with careful consideration of the possibility of A1C assay interference. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the con\ufb01rmatory screen- ing test. For example, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results $6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) but not FPG (<126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]), that person should nevertheless be consid- ered to have diabetes.

This scenario is likely for FPG and 2-h PG if the glucose samples remain at room temperature and are not centrifuged promptly. Because of the potential for preanalytic variability, it is critical that samples for plasma glucose be spun and separated immediately after they are drawn. If patients have test results near the margins of the diagnostic threshold, the health care professional should dis- cuss signs and symptoms with the pa- tient and repeat the test in 3\u20136 months. People should consume a mixed diet with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to oral glucose tolerance testing (58\u201360).

B Immune-Mediated Diabetes This form, previously called \u201cinsulin- dependent diabetes\u201d or \u201cjuvenile-onset diabetes,\u201d accounts for 5\u201310% of diabetes and is due to cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic b-cells. Au- toimmune markers include islet cell auto- antibodies and autoantibodies to GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD65), insulin, the tyrosine phosphatases islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and IA-2b, and zinc trans- porter 8. Numerous clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of islet autoimmunity (trialnet.org/our-research/prevention- studies) (14,17,61\u201364). Stage 1 of type 1 diabetes is de\ufb01ned by the presence of two or more of these au- toimmune markers. The disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQB1 and DRB1 haplotypes, and genetic screening has been used in some research studies to identify high-risk populations. Speci\ufb01c alleles in these genes can be either predisposing or protective (Table 2.1). The rate of b-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (particularly but not exclusively in infants and children) and slow in others (mainly but not exclusively adults) (65,66). Chil- dren and adolescents often present with DKA as the \ufb01rst manifestation of the disease,",

Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/ or DKA with infection or other stress. Adults may retain suf\ufb01cient b-cell func- tion to prevent DKA for many years; such individuals may have remission or decreased insulin needs for months or years and eventually become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for DKA (5\u20137,67,68). At this later stage of the disease, there is lit- tle or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C- peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age, even in the 8th and 9th decades of life. Autoimmune destruction of b-cells has multiple genetic factors and is also re- lated to environmental factors that are still poorly de\ufb01ned. Although individuals do not typically have obesity when they present with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increasingly common in the general pop- ulation; as such, obesity should not pre- clude testing for type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are also prone to other autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, ce- liac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gra- vis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4, \u201cComprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities\u201d).

As indicated by the names, these disorders are associated with other autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. Introduction of immunotherapy, spe- ci\ufb01cally checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer treatment has led to unexpected ad- verse events, including immune system activation precipitating autoimmune dis- ease. Fulminant onset of type 1 diabe- tes can develop, with DKA and low or undetectable levels of C-peptide as a marker of endogenous b-cell function (71,72). Fewer than half of these pa- tients have autoantibodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes, supporting alternate pathobiology. This immune-related adverse event occurs in just under 1% of check- point inhibitor-treated patients but most commonly occurs with agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1/ programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (73). To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor\u2013 related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA-DR4 (present in 76% of patients), whereas other high-risk HLA alleles are not more common than those in the general population (73).

Indeed, the risk of type 1 diabetes increases as the number of relevant autoantibodies detected increases (63,78,79). In The En- vironmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, type 1 diabetes developed in 21% of 363 subjects with at least one autoantibody at 3 years of age (80). Such testing, coupled with edu- cation about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable ear- lier diagnosis and prevent DKA (81,82). While widespread clinical screening of asymptomatic low-risk individuals is not currently recommended due to lack of approved therapeutic interventions, several innovative research screening pro- grams are available in Europe (e.g., Fr1da, gppad.org) and the U.S. (trialnet.org, askhealth.org).

Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults are outlined in Table 2.3. Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially ab- dominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. The pres- ence of prediabetes should prompt com- prehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors. Diagnosis IFG is de\ufb01ned as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) (82,83) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (25). It should be noted that the World Health Organiza- tion and numerous other diabetes organ- izations de\ufb01ne the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). As with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes as de\ufb01ned by A1C criteria demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a sys- tematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8\u201312 years), those with A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% (between 37 and 42 mmol/mol) had a substantially increased risk of diabetes (5-year incidence from 9% to 25%). Those with an A1C range of 6.0\u20136.5% (42\u201348 mmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of develop- ing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher",

In a community-based study of African American and non-Hispanic White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and car- diovascular events than fasting glucose (87). Other analyses suggest that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associ- ated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (88), and A1C at baseline was a strong predictor of the development of glucose-de\ufb01ned diabetes during the DPP and its follow-up (89). Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7\u20136.4% (39\u201347 mmol/mol) as identifying individuals with prediabe- tes. Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT, individuals with A1C of 5.7\u20136.4% (39\u2013 47 mmol/mol) should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and CVD and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section 3, \u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\u201d). Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so as A1C rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportionately (86). Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C >6.0% [42 mmol/mol]).

Nevertheless, even undiagnosed people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing macro- vascular and microvascular complications. People with type 2 diabetes may have insulin levels that appear normal or ele- vated, yet the failure to normalize blood glucose re\ufb02ects a relative defect in glu- cose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, insulin secretion is defective in these individuals and insuf\ufb01cient to compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction, physical activity, and/or pharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia but is sel- dom restored to normal. Recent inter- ventions with intensive diet and exercise or surgical weight loss have led to diabe- tes remission (92\u201398) (see Section 8, \u201cObesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d). The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity (99,100). It occurs more frequently in individuals with prior gesta- tional diabetes mellitus (GDM) or poly- cystic ovary syndrome. It is also more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial/ethnic subgroups (African American, Native American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American).

In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g., GAD65 autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (8). Screening and Testing for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adults Screening for prediabetes and type 2 di- abetes risk through an informal assess- ment of risk factors (Table 2.3) or with an assessment tool, such as the ADA risk test (Fig. 2.1) (online at diabetes. org/socrisktest), is recommended to guide health care professionals on whether performing a diagnostic test (Table 2.2) is appropriate. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet criteria for conditions in which early detection via screening is appropriate. Both conditions are common and impose signi\ufb01cant clin- ical and public health burdens. There is often a long presymptomatic phase be- fore the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available (101). The duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. There are effective interventions that prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes. It is im- portant to individualize risk/bene\ufb01t of formal intervention for people with pre- diabetes and consider patient-centered goals. Risk models have explored the bene\ufb01t, in general \ufb01nding higher ben- e\ufb01t of intervention in those at highest risk (102) (see Section 3, \u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\u201d) and reduce the risk of diabetes complications (103) (see Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk",

In the most recent Na- tional Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) report, prevention of progres- sion from prediabetes to diabetes (104) resulted in lower rates of developing ret- inopathy and nephropathy (105). Similar impact on diabetes complications was reported with screening, diagnosis, and comprehensive risk factor management in the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink database (103). In that report, progression from prediabetes to diabetes augmented risk of complications. Approximately one-quarter of people with diabetes in the U.S. and nearly half of Asian and Hispanic American people with diabetes are undiagnosed (106,107). Although screening of asymptomatic indi- viduals to identify those with prediabetes or diabetes might seem reasonable, rigor- ous clinical trials to prove the effective- ness of such screening have not been conducted and are unlikely to occur. Clinical conditions, such as hyperten- sion, hypertensive pregnancy, and obe- sity, enhance risk (108). Based on a population estimate, diabetes in people of childbearing age is underdiagnosed (109). Employing a probabilistic model, Peterson et al. (110) demonstrated cost and health bene\ufb01ts of preconception screening. A large European randomized con- trolled trial compared the impact of screening for diabetes and intensive multifactorial intervention with that of screening and routine care (111).

The excellent care pro- vided to patients in the routine care group and the lack of an unscreened control arm limited the authors\u2019 ability to determine whether screening and early treatment improved outcomes com- pared with no screening and later treat- ment after clinical diagnoses. Computer simulation modeling studies suggest that major bene\ufb01ts are likely to accrue from the early diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes (112); more- over, screening, beginning at age 30 or 45 years and independent of risk factors, may be cost-effective (<$11,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained\u20142010 modeling data) (113). Cost-effectiveness of screening has been reinforced in co- hort studies (114,115). Additional considerations regarding testing for type 2 diabetes and predia- betes in asymptomatic individuals in- clude the following. Age Age is a major risk factor for diabetes. Testing should begin at no later than age 35 years for all people (116). Screening should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity and one or more risk factors for diabetes. BMI and Ethnicity In general, BMI $25 kg/m2 is a risk fac- tor for diabetes. However, data suggest that the BMI cut point should be lower for the Asian American population (117,118). The BMI",

An argument can be made to push the BMI cut point to lower than 23 kg/m2 in favor of in- creased sensitivity; however, this would lead to an unacceptably low speci\ufb01city (13.1%). Data from the World Health Organization also suggest that a BMI of $23 kg/m2 should be used to de\ufb01ne in- creased risk in Asian American individu- als (119). The \ufb01nding that one-third to one-half of diabetes in Asian American people is undiagnosed suggests that testing is not occurring at lower BMI thresholds (99,120). Evidence also suggests that other pop- ulations may bene\ufb01t from lower BMI cut points. For example, in a large multiethnic cohort study, for an equivalent incidence rate of diabetes, a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in non-Hispanic White individuals was equiv- alent to a BMI of 26 kg/m2 in African American individuals (121). Medications Certain medications, such as glucocorti- coids, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medi- cations (34), and atypical antipsychotics (92), are known to increase the risk of diabetes and should be considered when deciding whether to screen. HIV Individuals with HIV are at higher risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes on antiretroviral (ARV) therapies; a screening protocol is therefore recom- mended (122). The A1C test may underes- timate glycemia in people with HIV; it is not recommended for diagnosis and may present challenges for monitoring (35). In",

Among people with HIV and dia- betes, preventive health care using an approach used in people without HIV is critical to reduce the risks of micro- vascular and macrovascular complica- tions. Diabetes risk is increased with certain PIs and NRTIs. New-onset diabe- tes is estimated to occur in more than 5% of individuals infected with HIV on PIs, whereas more than 15% may have prediabetes (123). PIs are associated with insulin resis- tance and may also lead to apoptosis of pancreatic b-cells. NRTIs also affect fat distribution (both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy), which is associated with insulin resistance. For people with HIV and ARV-associated hyperglycemia, it may be appropriate to consider discontinuing the problematic ARV agents if safe and effective alternatives are available (124). Before making ARV substitutions, care- fully consider the possible effect on HIV virological control and the poten- tial adverse effects of new ARV agents. In some cases, antihyperglycemic agents may still be necessary. Testing Interval The appropriate interval between screen- ing tests is not known (125). The rationale for the 3-year interval is that with this in- terval, the number of false-positive tests that require con\ufb01rmatory testing will be reduced, and individuals with false- negative tests will be retested before substantial time elapses and complica- tions develop (125).

Community screening outside a health care setting is generally not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. However, in speci\ufb01c situations where an adequate re- ferral system is established beforehand for positive tests, community screening may be considered. Community screen- ing may also be poorly targeted; i.e., it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at very low risk or even those who have already been diagnosed (126). Screening in Dental Practices Because periodontal disease is associ- ated with diabetes, the utility of screen- ing in a dental setting and referral to primary care as a means to improve the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes has been explored (127\u2013129), with one study estimating that 30% of patients $30 years of age seen in general dental practices had dysglycemia (129,130).

See Section 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d for additional information on type 2 dia- betes in children and adolescents. Some studies question the validity of A1C in the pediatric population, espe- cially among certain ethnicities, and suggest OGTT or FPG as more suitable diagnostic tests (131). However, many of these studies do not recognize that diabetes diagnostic criteria are based on long-term health outcomes, and vali- dations are not currently available in the pediatric population (132). The ADA acknowledges the limited data support- ing A1C for diagnosing type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. Although A1C is not recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in children with cystic \ufb01bro- sis or symptoms suggestive of acute on- set of type 1 diabetes, and only A1C assays without interference are appro- priate for children with hemoglobinopa- thies, the ADA continues to recommend A1C and the criteria in Table 2.2 for di- agnosis of type 2 diabetes in this cohort to decrease barriers to screening (133,134).

E Cystic \ufb01brosis\u2013related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in people with cystic \ufb01brosis, occurring in about 20% of adolescents and 40\u201350% of adults (135). Diabetes in this population, com- pared with individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is associated with worse nutritional status, more severe in\ufb02amma- tory lung disease, and greater mortality. In- sulin insuf\ufb01ciency is the primary defect in CFRD. Genetically determined b-cell func- tion and insulin resistance associated with infection and in\ufb02ammation may also contribute to the development of CFRD. Milder abnormalities of glucose toler- ance are even more common and occur at earlier ages than CFRD. Whether indi- viduals with IGT should be treated with insulin replacement has not currently been determined. Although screening for diabetes before the age of 10 years can identify risk for progression to CFRD in those with abnormal glucose toler- ance, no bene\ufb01t has been established with respect to weight, height, BMI, or lung function. OGTT is the recommended screening test; however, recent publica- tions suggest that an A1C cut point threshold of 5.5% (5.8% in a second study) would detect more than 90%",

Regardless of age, weight loss or failure of expected weight gain is a risk for CFRD and should prompt screening (136,137). The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (139) evaluated 3,553 people with cystic \ufb01brosis and diag- nosed 445 (13%) with CFRD. Early di- agnosis and treatment of CFRD was associated with preservation of lung function. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry reported an in- crease in CFRD with age (increased 10% per decade), genotype, decreased lung function, and female sex (140,141). Con- tinuous glucose monitoring or HOMA of b-cell function (142) may be more sensi- tive than OGTT to detect risk for progres- sion to CFRD; however, evidence linking these results to long-term outcomes is lacking, and these tests are not recom- mended for screening outside of the re- search setting (143). CFRD mortality has signi\ufb01cantly de- creased over time, and the gap in mor- tality between people with cystic \ufb01brosis with and without diabetes has consider- ably narrowed (144). There are limited clinical trial data on therapy for CFRD.

Another term, \u201cposttransplantation diabetes mellitus\u201d (PTDM) (148,149), de- scribes the presence of diabetes in the posttransplant setting irrespective of the timing of diabetes onset. Hyperglycemia is very common dur- ing the early posttransplant period, with \u000390% of kidney allograft recipients ex- hibiting hyperglycemia in the \ufb01rst few weeks following transplant (148\u2013151). In most cases, such stress- or steroid- induced hyperglycemia resolves by the time of discharge (151,152). Although the use of immunosuppressive thera- pies is a major contributor to the devel- opment of PTDM, the risks of transplant rejection outweigh the risks of PTDM, and the role of the diabetes care health care professional is to treat hyperglyce- mia appropriately regardless of the type of immunosuppression (148). Risk fac- tors for PTDM include both general dia- betes risks (such as age, family history of diabetes, etc.) as well as transplant- speci\ufb01c factors, such as use of immuno- suppressant agents (153\u2013155). Whereas posttransplantation hyperglycemia is an important risk factor for subsequent PTDM, a formal diagnosis of PTDM is op- timally made once the patient is stable on maintenance mmunosuppression and diabetesjournals.org/care Classification and Diagnosis of Diabetes S29 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Risk factors for PTDM included elevated BMI, discharge from the hospital on insulin, and glucose val- ues in the 24 h prior to hospital dis- charge (157). In an Iranian cohort, 19% had PTDM after heart and lung trans- plant (158). The OGTT is considered the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of PTDM (1 year posttransplant) (148, 149,159,160). Pretransplant elevation in hs-CRP was associated with PTDM in the setting of renal transplant (161,162). However, screening people with fasting glucose and/or A1C can identify high- risk individuals requiring further assess- ment and may reduce the number of overall OGTTs required. Few randomized controlled studies have reported on the short- and long- term use of antihyperglycemic agents in the setting of PTDM (153,163,164). Most studies have reported that trans- plant patients with hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplantation have higher rates of rejection, infection, and rehospi- talization (151,153,165). Insulin therapy is the agent of choice for the manage- ment of hyperglycemia, PTDM, and pre- existing diabetes and diabetes in the hospital setting. After discharge, people with preexisting diabetes could go back on their pretransplant regimen if they were in good control before transplanta- tion.

Drug dose adjustments may be required be- cause of decreases in the glomerular \ufb01ltration rate, a relatively common complication in transplant patients. A small short-term pilot study reported that metformin was safe to use in re- nal transplant recipients (166), but its safety has not been determined in other types of organ transplant. Thiazolidi- nediones have been used successfully in people with liver and kidney transplants, but side effects include \ufb02uid retention, heart failure, and osteopenia (167,168). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors do not interact with immunosuppressant drugs and have demonstrated safety in small clinical trials (169,170).

E Monogenic defects that cause b-cell dysfunction, such as neonatal diabetes and MODY, represent a small fraction of people with diabetes (<5%). Table 2.6 describes the most common causes of monogenic diabetes. For a comprehen- sive list of causes, see Genetic Diagnosis of Endocrine Disorders (171). Neonatal Diabetes Diabetes occurring under 6 months of age is termed \u201cneonatal\u201d or \u201ccongenital\u201d diabetes, and about 80\u201385% of cases can be found to have an underlying monogenic cause (8,172\u2013175). Neonatal diabetes occurs much less often after 6 months of age, whereas autoimmune type 1 diabetes rarely occurs before 6 months of age. Neonatal diabetes can either be transient or permanent. Tran- sient diabetes is most often due to over- expression of genes on chromosome 6q24, is recurrent in about half of cases, and may be treatable with medications other than insulin. Permanent neonatal diabetes is most commonly due to auto- somal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 subunit (KCNJ11) and SUR1 subunit (ABCC8) of the b-cell KATP channel. A recent report details a de novo mutation in EIF2B1 affecting eIF2 signaling associated with permanent neonatal diabetes and hepatic dys- function, similar to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome but with few severe comor- bidities (176).

Cor- rect diagnosis has critical implications be- cause 30\u201350% of people with KATP-related neonatal diabetes will exhibit improved blood glucose levels when treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of in- sulin. Insulin gene (INS) mutations are the second most common cause of perma- nent neonatal diabetes, and while inten- sive insulin management is currently the preferred treatment strategy, there are important genetic counseling considera- tions, as most of the mutations that cause diabetes are dominantly inherited. Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young MODY is frequently characterized by on- set of hyperglycemia at an early age (classically before age 25 years, although diagnosis may occur at older ages). MODY is characterized by impaired insu- lin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action (in the absence of coex- istent obesity). It is inherited in an autoso- mal dominant pattern with abnormalities in at least 13 genes on different chromo- somes identi\ufb01ed to date (177). The most commonly reported forms are GCK-MODY (MODY2), HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and HNF4A-MODY (MODY1). For individuals with MODY, the treat- ment implications are considerable and warrant genetic testing (178,179). Clini- cally, people with GCK-MODY exhibit mild, stable fasting hyperglycemia and do not require antihyperglycemic ther- apy except commonly during pregnancy.

Mutations or de- letions in HNF1B are associated with re- nal cysts and uterine malformations (renal cysts and diabetes [RCAD] syndrome). Other extremely rare forms of MODY have been reported to involve other transcription factor genes, including PDX1 (IPF1) and NEUROD1. Diagnosis of Monogenic Diabetes A diagnosis of one of the three most common forms of MODY, including HFN1A- MODY, GCK-MODY, and HNF4A-MODY, allows for more cost-effective therapy (no therapy for GCK-MODY; sulfonylureas as \ufb01rst-line therapy for HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY). Additionally, diag- nosis can lead to identi\ufb01cation of other affected family members. Genetic screen- ing is increasingly available and cost- effective (176,178). A diagnosis of MODY should be con- sidered in individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although admit- tedly, \u201catypical diabetes\u201d is becoming increasingly dif\ufb01cult to precisely de\ufb01ne in the absence of a de\ufb01nitive set of tests for either type of diabetes (173\u2013175, 178\u2013184).

It is critical to correctly diag- nose one of the monogenic forms of di- abetes because these individuals may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to subopti- mal, even potentially harmful, treatment plans and delays in diagnosing other family members (188). The correct diag- nosis is especially critical for those with GCK-MODY mutations, where multiple studies have shown that no complications ensue in the absence of glucose-lowering therapy (189).

This de\ufb01nition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and clas- si\ufb01cation of GDM, but this de\ufb01nition has serious limitations (203). First, the best available evidence reveals that many cases of GDM represent preexisting hyperglycemia that is detected by rou- tine screening in pregnancy, as routine screening is not widely performed in nonpregnant individuals of reproduc- tive age. It is the severity of hypergly- cemia that is clinically important with regard to both short- and long-term maternal and fetal risks.

Strong racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of un- diagnosed diabetes. Therefore, early screening provides an initial step to identify these health disparities so that they can begin to be addressed (209\u2013212). Standard diagnostic criteria for identifying undiagnosed diabetes in early pregnancy are the same as those used in the nonpregnant population (Table 2.2).

Early abnormal glucose metabolism, de\ufb01ned as fasting glucose threshold of 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or an A1C of 5.9% (39 mmol/mol), may identify in- dividuals who are at higher risk of ad- verse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (preeclampsia, macrosomia, shoulder dys- tocia, perinatal death), are more likely to need insulin treatment, and are at high risk of a later GDM diagnosis (214\u2013220). An A1C threshold of 5.7% has not been shown to be associated with adverse peri- natal outcomes (221,222). If early screening is negative, individ- uals should be rescreened for GDM be- tween 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (see Section 15, \u201cManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\u201d). The Interna- tional Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) GDM diagnostic criteria for the 75-g OGTT, as well as the GDM screening and diagnos- tic criteria used in the two-step ap- proach, were not derived from data in the \ufb01rst half of pregnancy and should not be used for early screening (223). To date, most randomized controlled trials of treatment of early abnormal glucose metabolism have been underpowered for outcomes. Therefore, the bene\ufb01ts of treatment for early abnormal glucose metabolism remain uncertain.

Both the fasting glucose and A1C are low-cost tests. An advantage of the A1C is its convenience, as it can be added to the prenatal laboratories and does not require an early-morning fasting ap- pointment. Disadvantages include inac- curacies in the presence of increased red blood cell turnover and hemoglo- binopathies (usually reads lower) and higher values with anemia and reduced red blood cell turnover (224). A1C is not reliable to screen for GDM or for preexisting diabetes at 15 weeks of gestation or later. See Recommendation 2.3 above. GDM is often indicative of underlying b-cell dysfunction (225), which confers marked increased risk for later develop- ment of diabetes, generally but not al- ways type 2 diabetes, in the mother after delivery (226,227). As effective prevention interventions are available (228,229), individuals diagnosed with GDM should receive lifelong screening for prediabetes to allow interventions to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 diabetes to allow treatment at the earliest possible time (230). Diagnosis GDM carries risks for the mother, fetus, and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (231), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant individuals, demon- strated that risk of adverse maternal, fe- tal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal gly- cemia at 24\u201328 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously consid-",

GDM diagnosis (Table 2.7) can be ac- complished with either of two strategies: 1. The \u201cone-step\u201d 75-g OGTT derived from the IADPSG criteria, or 2. The older \u201ctwo-step\u201d approach with a 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a 100-g OGTT for those who screen positive based on the work of Carpenter-Coustan\u2019s interpretation of the older O\u2019Sullivan and Mahan (232) criteria.

Many regional studies have investigated the impact of adopting the IADPSG criteria on prevalence and have seen a roughly one- to threefold in- crease (234). The anticipated increase in the incidence of GDM could have a substantial impact on costs and medical infrastructure needs and has the po- tential to \u201cmedicalize\u201d pregnancies pre- viously categorized as normal. A recent follow-up study of individuals participating in a blinded study of pregnancy OGTTs found that 11 years after their pregnan- cies, individuals who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach, as compared with those without, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 di- abetes and had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat, suggesting that the larger group of indi- viduals identi\ufb01ed by the one-step ap- proach would bene\ufb01t from the increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes that would accompany a history of GDM (235,236). The ADA recommends the IADPSG diagnostic criteria with the intent of optimizing gestational outcomes because these criteria are the only ones based on pregnancy outcomes rather than end points such as prediction of subsequent maternal diabetes. The expected bene\ufb01ts of using IADPSG criteria to the offspring are inferred from intervention trials that focused on individ- uals with lower levels of hyperglycemia than identi\ufb01ed using older GDM diag- nostic criteria.

The OGTT glucose cutoffs in these two trials overlapped the thresholds recom- mended by the IADPSG, and in one trial (238), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the cutoff recommended by the IADPSG (153 mg/dL [8.5 mmol/L]). No randomized controlled trials of treating versus not treating GDM diag- nosed by the IADPSG criteria but not the Carpenter-Coustan criteria have been published to date. However, a recent randomized trial of testing for GDM at 24\u201328 weeks of gestation by the one-step method using IADPSG criteria ver- sus the two-step method using a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT) and, if posi- tive, a 3-h OGTT by Carpenter-Coustan criteria identi\ufb01ed twice as many individu- als with GDM using the one-step method compared with the two-step method. Despite treating more individuals for GDM using the one-step method, there was no difference in pregnancy and peri- natal complications (239). However, con- cerns have been raised about sample size estimates and unanticipated sub- optimal engagement with the protocol with regard to screening and treatment. For example, in the two-step group, 165 participants who did not get counted as having GDM were treated for isolated el- evated fasting glucose >95 mg/dL (240).

Post hoc GDM in individuals diagnosed by the one- step method in the HAPO cohort was as- sociated with higher prevalence of IGT; higher 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h glucoses dur- ing the OGTT; and reduced insulin sensi- tivity and oral disposition index in their offspring at 10\u201314 years of age compared with offspring of mothers without GDM. Associations of mother\u2019s fasting, 1-h, and 2-h values on the 75-g OGTT were contin- uous with a comprehensive panel of off- spring metabolic outcomes (236,242). In addition, HAPO Follow-up Study (HAPO FUS) data demonstrate that neonatal adi- posity and fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord C-peptide), both higher across the contin- uum of maternal hyperglycemia, are me- diators of childhood body fat (243).

The panel recommended a two-step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g GLT followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those who screened positive. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (247). Updated from 2014, a 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force systematic review continues to conclude that one-step versus two-step screening is associated with increased likelihood of GDM (11.5% vs. 4.9%) but without im- proved health outcomes. It reports that the oral glucose challenge test using 140 or 135 mg/dL thresholds had sensitivities of 82% and 93% and speci\ufb01cities of 82% and 79%, respectively, against Carpenter- Coustan criteria. Fasting plasma glucose cutoffs of 85 mg/dL or 90 mg/dL had sensitivities of 88% and 81% and specif- icities of 73% and 82%, respectively, against Carpenter-Coustan criteria (248). The use of A1C at 24\u201328 weeks of gesta- tion as a screening test for GDM does not function as well as the GLT (249). Key factors cited by the NIH panel in their decision-making process were the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating the bene\ufb01ts of the one-step strategy and the potential negative consequences of identifying a large group of individu- als with GDM, including medicalization of pregnancy with increased health care utilization and costs.

A systematic review of economic evalu- ations of GDM screening found that the one-step method identi\ufb01ed more cases of GDM and was more likely to be cost- effective than the two-step method (254). The decision of which strategy to implement must therefore be made based on the relative values placed on factors that have yet to be measured (e.g., willingness to change practice based on correlation studies rather than intervention trial results, available infrastructure, and importance of cost considerations).

E Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes risk through an informal assessment of risk factors (Table 2.3) or with an assessment tool, such as the American Diabetes Association risk test (Fig. 2.1), is recommended to guide health care professionals on whether performing a diagnostic test for prediabetes (Table 2.5) and previously un- diagnosed type 2 diabetes (Table 2.2) is appropriate (see Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes\u201d). Testing high-risk adults for prediabetes is warranted be- cause the laboratory assessment is safe and reasonable in cost, substantial time ex- ists before the development of type 2 diabetes and its complications during which one can intervene, and there is an effective means of preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes in those determined to have prediabetes with an A1C 5.7\u20136.4% (39\u201347 mmol/mol), impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose. The util- ity of A1C screening for prediabetes and diabetes may be limited in the presence of hemoglobinopathies and conditions that affect red blood cell turnover. See Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes,\u201d and Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for additional details on the appropriate use and limitations of A1C testing.

A 3.3 A variety of eating patterns can be considered to prevent dia- betes in individuals with predi- abetes.

B The Diabetes Prevention Program Several major randomized controlled tri- als, including the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial (1), the Finnish Dia- betes Prevention Study (DPS) (2), and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study (Da Qing study) (3), demonstrate that lifestyle/behavioral intervention with an individualized reduced-calorie meal plan is highly effective in preventing or delay- ing type 2 diabetes and improving other cardiometabolic markers (such as blood pressure, lipids, and in\ufb02ammation) (4). The strongest evidence for diabetes pre- vention in the U.S. comes from the DPP trial (1). The DPP demonstrated that in- tensive lifestyle intervention",

Follow-up of three large studies of lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention showed sustained reduction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes: 39% reduction at 30 years in the Da Qing study (5), 43% reduction at 7 years in the Finnish DPS (2), and 34% reduction at 10 years (6) and 27% reduction at 15 years (7) in the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program Out- comes Study (DPPOS). The two major goals of the DPP inten- sive lifestyle intervention were to achieve and maintain a minimum of 7% weight loss and 150 min moderate-intensity phys- ical activity per week, such as brisk walk- ing. The DPP lifestyle intervention was a goal-based intervention. All participants were given the same weight loss and physical activity goals, but individualization was permitted in the speci\ufb01c methods used to achieve the goals (8). Although weight loss was the most important fac- tor in reducing the risk of incident diabe- tes, it was also found that achieving the target behavioral goal of at least 150 min of physical activity per week, even without achieving the weight loss goal, reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 44% (9). The 7% weight loss goal was selected because it was feasible to achieve and maintain and likely to lessen the risk of developing diabetes. Participants were encouraged to achieve the $7% weight loss during the \ufb01rst 6 months of the in- tervention. Further",

Cal- orie goals were calculated by estimating the daily calories needed to maintain the participant\u2019s initial weight and subtracting 500\u20131,000 calories/day (depending on ini- tial body weight). The initial focus of the dietary intervention was on reducing total fat rather than calories. After several weeks, the concept of calorie balance and the need to restrict calories and fat was introduced (8). The goal for physical activity was se- lected to approximate at least 700 kcal/ week expenditure from physical activity. For ease of translation, this goal was described as at least 150 min of moderate- intensity physical activity per week, similar in intensity to brisk walking. Partici- pants were encouraged to distribute their activity throughout the week with a minimum frequency of three times per week and at least 10 min per ses- sion. A maximum of 75 min of strength training could be applied toward the total 150 min/week physical activity goal (8). To implement the weight loss and physical activity goals, the DPP used an individual model of treatment rather than a group-based approach. This choice was based on a desire to intervene before participants had the possibility of devel- oping diabetes or losing interest in the program. The individual approach also al- lowed for the tailoring of interventions to re\ufb02ect the diversity of the population (8). The DPP intervention was adminis- tered as a",

It included sessions on lowering calories, increasing physical ac- tivity, self-monitoring, maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors, and guidance on managing psychological, social, and moti- vational challenges. Further details are available regarding the core curriculum sessions (8). Nutrition Nutrition counseling for weight loss in the DPP lifestyle intervention arm included a reduction of total dietary fat and calories (1,8,9). However, evidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calo- ries from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people to prevent diabetes; there- fore, macronutrient distribution should be based on an individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals (10). Based on other inter- vention trials, a variety of eating patterns characterized by the totality of food and beverages habitually consumed (10,11) may also be appropriate for individuals with prediabetes (10), including Mediter- ranean-style and low-carbohydrate eating plans (12\u201315). Observational studies have also shown that vegetarian, plant-based (may include some animal products), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating patterns are associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 di- abetes (16\u201319).

Physical Activity Just as 150 min/week of moderate- intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, showed bene\ufb01cial effects in those with prediabetes (1), moderate- intensity physical activity has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce abdominal fat in children and young adults (24,25). Based on these \ufb01ndings, health care professionals are encouraged to promote a DPP-style program, includ- ing a focus on physical activity, to all indi- viduals who have been identi\ufb01ed to be at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition to aerobic activity, a physical ac- tivity plan designed to prevent diabetes may include resistance training (8,26,27). Breaking up prolonged sedentary time may also be encouraged, as it is associ- ated with moderately lower postprandial glucose levels (28,29). The preventive ef- fects of physical activity appear to extend to the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (30). Delivery and Dissemination of Lifestyle Behavior Change for Diabetes Prevention Because the intensive lifestyle interven- tion in the DPP was effective in prevent- ing type 2 diabetes among those at high risk for the disease and lifestyle behavior change programs for diabetes prevention were shown to be cost-effective, broader efforts to disseminate scalable lifestyle behavior change programs for diabetes prevention with coverage by third-party payers ensued (31\u201335).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP), a resource designed to bring such evidence-based lifestyle change programs for preventing type 2 diabetes to com- munities (cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/ index.htm). This online resource includes locations of CDC-recognized diabetes pre- vention lifestyle change programs (cdc. gov/diabetes/prevention/\ufb01nd-a-program. html). To be eligible for this program, in- dividuals must have a BMI in the over- weight range and be at risk for diabetes based on laboratory testing, a previous diagnosis of GDM, or a positive risk test (cdc.gov/prediabetes/takethetest/). Dur- ing the \ufb01rst 4 years of implementation of the CDC\u2019s National DPP, 35.5% achieved the 5% weight loss goal (41).

Medicaid cover- age of the DPP lifestyle intervention is also expanding on a state-by-state basis. While CDC-recognized behavioral coun- seling programs, including Medicare DPP services, have met minimum quality standards and are reimbursed by many payers, lower retention rates have been reported for younger adults and racial/ ethnic minority populations (43). There- fore, other programs and modalities of behavioral counseling for diabetes pre- vention may also be appropriate and ef- \ufb01cacious based on individual preferences and availability. The use of community health workers to support DPP efforts has been shown to be effective and cost-effective (44,45) (see Section 1, \u201cImproving Care and Promoting Health in Populations,\u201d for more information). The use of community health workers may facilitate the adoption of behavior changes for diabetes prevention while bridging barriers related to social deter- minants of health. However, coverage by third-party payers remains problem- atic. Counseling by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) has been shown to help individuals with prediabetes im- prove eating habits, increase physical activity, and achieve 7\u201310% weight loss (10,46\u201348).

Al- though the Vitamin D and Type 2 Dia- betes (D2d) prospective randomized controlled trial showed no signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t of vitamin D versus placebo on the progression to type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk (77), post hoc analyses and meta-analyses suggest a potential bene\ufb01t in speci\ufb01c populations (77\u201380).

By the time of the 15-year follow- up (DPPOS), exploratory analyses demon- strated that participants with a higher baseline fasting glucose ($110 mg/dL vs. 95\u2013109 mg/dL), those with a higher A1C (6.0\u20136.4% vs. <6.0%), and individuals with a history of GDM (vs. individuals with- out a history of GDM) experienced higher risk reductions with metformin, identifying subgroups of participants that bene\ufb01tted the most from metformin (84). In the In- dian Diabetes Prevention Program (IDPP-1), metformin and lifestyle intervention re- duced diabetes risk similarly at 30 months; of note, the lifestyle intervention in IDPP-1 was less intensive than that in the DPP (85). Based on \ufb01ndings from the DPP, met- formin should be recommended as an op- tion for high-risk individuals (e.g., those with a history of GDM or those with BMI $35 kg/m2). Consider periodic monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in those taking metformin chronically to check for pos- sible de\ufb01ciency (86,87) (see Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d for more details). While there is not a universally accepted rec- ommended periodicity of monitoring, it is notable that the lowering effect of met- formin on vitamin B12 increases with time (88), with a signi\ufb01cantly higher risk for vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency (<150 pmol/L) noted at 4.3 years in the HOME (Hyperin- sulinaemia: the Outcome of its Metabolic Effects) study (88) and signi\ufb01cantly greater risk of low B12 levels (#203 pg/mL) at 5 years in the",

PREVENTION OF VASCULAR DISEASE AND MORTALITY Recommendations 3.8 Prediabetes is associated with heightened cardiovascular risk; therefore, screening for and treatment of modi\ufb01able risk fac- tors for cardiovascular disease are suggested. B 3.9 Statin therapy may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in peo- ple at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In such individ- uals, glucose status should be monitored regularly and diabe- tes prevention approaches rein- forced. It is not recommended that statins be discontinued. B 3.10 In people with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance and prediabetes, pio- glitazone may be considered to lower the risk of stroke or myo- cardial infarction. However, this bene\ufb01t needs to be balanced with the increased risk of weight gain, edema, and fracture. A Lower doses may mitigate the risk of adverse effects. C People with prediabetes often have other cardiovascular risk factors, includ- ing hypertension and dyslipidemia (90), and are at increased risk for cardiovas- cular disease (91,92). If indicated, evalu- ation for tobacco use and referral for tobacco cessation should be part of rou- tine care for those at risk for diabetes. Of note, the years immediately follow- ing smoking cessation may represent a time of increased risk for diabetes (93\u201395), a time when individuals should S44",

See Section 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes,\u201d for more detailed in- formation. The lifestyle interventions for weight loss in study populations at risk for type 2 diabetes have shown a reduc- tion in cardiovascular risk factors and the need for medications used to treat these cardiovascular risk factors (96,97). In longer-term follow-up, lifestyle inter- ventions for diabetes prevention also prevented the development of micro- vascular complications among women enrolled in the DPPOS and in the study population enrolled in the China Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Outcome Study (7,98). The lifestyle intervention in the latter study was also ef\ufb01cacious in preventing cardiovascular disease and mortality at 23 and 30 years of follow-up (3,5). Treat- ment goals and therapies for hyperten- sion and dyslipidemia in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for people with prediabetes should be based on their level of cardiovascular risk. In- creased vigilance is warranted to identify and treat these and other cardiovascular diseases risk factors (99). Statins have been associated with a modestly in- creased risk of diabetes (100\u2013104). In the DPP, statin use was associated with greater diabetes risk irrespective of the treatment group (pooled hazard ratio [95% CI] for incident diabetes 1.36 [1.17\u2013 1.58]) (102). In studies of primary pre- vention of cardiovascular disease, cardio- vascular and mortality bene\ufb01ts of statin therapy exceed the risk of diabetes (105,106), suggesting a",

Cardiovascular outcome trials in people without diabetes also inform risk reduc- tion potential in people without diabetes at increased cardiometabolic risk (see Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,\u201d for more details). The IRIS (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) trial was a dedicated study of people with a recent (<6 months) stroke or transient ischemic attack, without dia- betes but with insulin resistance, as de- \ufb01ned by a HOMA of insulin resistance index of $3.0, evaluating pioglitazone (target dose of 45 mg daily) compared with placebo. At 4.8 years, the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction, as well as the risk of diabetes, was lower within the pioglitazone group than with placebo, though risks of weight gain, edema, and fracture were higher in the pioglitazone treatment group (107\u2013109). Lower doses may mitigate the adverse effects, though further study is needed to con\ufb01rm the bene\ufb01t at lower doses (110). PERSON-CENTERED CARE GOALS Recommendations 3.11 In adults with overweight/ obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes, care goals should in- clude weight loss or preven- tion of weight gain, minimizing the progression of hypergly- cemia, and attention to cardio- vascular risk and associated comorbidities.

A Individualized risk/bene\ufb01t should be con- sidered in screening, intervention, and monitoring to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and associated comorbidities. Multiple factors, including age, BMI, and other comorbidities, may in\ufb02uence the risk of progression to diabetes and life- time risk of complications (111,112). In the DPP, which enrolled high-risk individ- uals with impaired glucose tolerance, ele- vated fasting glucose, and elevated BMI, the crude incidence of diabetes within the placebo arm was 11.0 cases per 100 person-years, with a cumulative 3-year incidence of diabetes of 28.9% (1). Characteristics of individuals in the DPP/ DPPOS who were at particularly high risk of progression to diabetes (crude inci- dence of diabetes 14\u201322 cases/100 person- years) included BMI $35 kg/m2, those at higher glucose levels (e.g., fasting plasma glucose 110\u2013125 mg/dL, 2-h postchallenge glucose 173\u2013199 mg/dL, and A1C $6.0%), and individuals with a history of gestational diabetes (1,82,83). In contrast, in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, observa- tional follow-up of older adults (mean age 75 years) with laboratory evidence of prediabetes (based on A1C 5.7\u20136.4% and/or fasting glucose 100\u2013125 mg/dL), but not meeting speci\ufb01c BMI criteria, found much lower progression to diabe- tes over 6 years: 9% of those with A1C-",

Risk models have explored risk-based bene\ufb01t, gener- ally \ufb01nding higher bene\ufb01t of the inter- vention in those at highest risk (9). Diabetes prevention and observational studies highlight key principles that may guide person-centered goals. In the DPP, which enrolled a high-risk population meeting criteria for overweight/obesity, weight loss was an important mediator of diabetes prevention or delay, with greater metabolic bene\ufb01t generally seen with greater weight loss (9,113). In the DPP/DPPOS, progression to diabetes, duration of diabetes, and mean level of glycemia were important determinants of the development of microvascular complications (7). Furthermore, the abil- ity to achieve normal glucose regulation, even once, during the DPP was associ- ated with a lower risk of diabetes and lower risk of microvascular complications (114). Observational follow-up of the Da Qing study also showed that regres- sion from impaired glucose tolerance to normal glucose tolerance or remaining with impaired glucose tolerance rather than progressing to type 2 diabetes at the end of the 6-year intervention trial resulted in signi\ufb01cantly lower risk of car- diovascular disease and microvascular disease over 30 years (115). Prediabetes is associated with increased cardio- vascular disease and mortality (92), emphasizing the importance of at- tending to cardiovascular risk in this population. diabetesjournals.org/care Prevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities S45 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The goals of treatment for diabetes are to prevent or delay complications and optimize quality of life (Fig. 4.1). Treatment goals and plans should be cre- ated with people with diabetes based on their individual preferences, values, and goals. This individualized management plan should take into account the per- son\u2019s age, cognitive abilities, school/ work schedule and conditions, health beliefs, support systems, eating patterns, physical activity, social situation, \ufb01nancial concerns, cultural factors, literacy and nu- meracy (mathematical literacy), diabetes history (duration, complications, current use of medications), comorbidities, dis- abilities, health priorities, other medical conditions, preferences for care, and life expectancy. Various strategies and tech- niques should be used to support the person\u2019s self-management efforts, includ- ing providing education on problem- solving skills for all aspects of diabetes management. Health care professional communica- tion with people with diabetes and fami- lies should acknowledge that multiple factors impact glycemic management but also emphasize that collaboratively devel- oped treatment plans and a healthy life- style can signi\ufb01cantly improve disease outcomes and well-being (4\u20138). Thus, the goal of communication between health care professionals and people with dia- betes is to establish a collaborative rela- tionship and to assess and address self- management barriers without blaming people with diabetes for \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cnonadherence\u201d when the outcomes of self-management are",

The familiar terms \u201cnoncompliance\u201d and \u201cnonadherence\u201d denote a passive, obe- dient role for a person with diabetes in \u201cfollowing doctor\u2019s orders\u201d that is at odds with the active role people with diabetes take in directing the day-to-day decision-making, planning, monitoring, evaluation, and problem-solving involved in diabetes self-management. Using a nonjudgmental approach that normalizes periodic lapses in management may help minimize the person\u2019s resistance to re- porting problems with self-management. Empathizing and using active listening techniques, such as open-ended ques- tions, re\ufb02ective statements, and summa- rizing what the person said, can help facilitate communication. Perceptions of people with diabetes about their own ability, or self-ef\ufb01cacy, to self-manage diabetes constitute one important psy- chosocial factor related to improved dia- betes self-management and treatment outcomes in diabetes (10\u201312) and should be a target of ongoing assessment, edu- cation, and treatment planning.

B The comprehensive medical evaluation includes the initial and follow-up evalua- tions, assessment of complications, psy- chosocial assessment, management of comorbid conditions, overall health sta- tus, and engagement of the person with diabetes throughout the process. While a comprehensive list is provided in Table 4.1, in clinical practice the health care pro- fessional may need to prioritize the components of the medical evaluation given the available resources and time. The goal is to provide the health care team information so it can optimally sup- port people with diabetes. In addition to the medical history, physical examina- tion, and laboratory tests, health care professionals should assess diabetes self- management behaviors, nutrition, social determinants of health, and psychosocial health (see Section 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes\u201d) and give guidance on routine immunizations. The assessment of sleep pattern and duration should be considered; a meta-analysis found that poor sleep quality, short sleep, and long sleep were associated with higher A1C in people with type 2 diabe- tes (14). Interval follow-up visits should occur at least every 3\u20136 months individu- alized to the person and then at least annually.

People with diabe- tes should receive recommended preven- tive care services (e.g., immunizations, cancer screening); smoking cessation counseling; and ophthalmological, den- tal, and podiatric referrals, as needed. The assessment of risk of acute and chronic diabetes complications and treatment planning are key components of initial and follow-up visits (Table 4.2). The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascu- lar disease and heart failure (see Sec- tion 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\u201d), chronic kidney disease staging (see Section 11, \u201cChronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management\u201d), pres- ence of retinopathy (see Section 12, \u201cRetinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care\u201d), and risk of treatment-associated hypoglycemia (Table 4.3) should be used to individualize targets for glycemia (see Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets\u201d), blood pres- sure, and lipids and to select speci\ufb01c glu- cose-lowering medication (see Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\u201d), antihypertension medication, and statin treatment intensity. Additional referrals should be arranged as necessary (Table 4.4). Clinicians should ensure that people with diabetes are appropriately screened for complications and comorbidities.

Influenza In\ufb02uenza is a common, preventable infec- tious disease associated with high mortality and morbidity in vulnerable populations, including youth, older adults, and peo- ple with chronic diseases. In\ufb02uenza vac- cination in people with diabetes has been found to signi\ufb01cantly reduce in\ufb02u- enza and diabetes-related hospital ad- missions (18). In people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in\ufb02uenza vaccine has been associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events (19). Given the bene\ufb01ts of the annual in\ufb02uenza vaccination, it is recommended for all individuals $6 months of age who do not have a contraindication. In- \ufb02uenza vaccination is critically important as the severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and in\ufb02uenza viruses will both be active in the U.S. during the 2022\u20132023 season (20).

Pneumococcal Pneumonia Like in\ufb02uenza, pneumococcal pneumonia is a common, preventable disease. Peo- ple with diabetes are at increased risk for the bacteremic form of pneumococcal in- fection and have been reported to have a high risk of nosocomial bacteremia, with a mortality rate as high as 50% (21). There are two types of vaccines available in the U.S., pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, and PCV20) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), with distinct schedules for chil- dren and adults. It is recommended that all children re- ceive a four-dose series of PCV13 or PCV15 by 15 months of age. For children with diabetes who have incomplete se- ries by ages 2\u20135 years, the CDC recom- mends a catch-up schedule to ensure that these children have four doses. Chil- dren with diabetes between 6 and 18 years of age are also advised to receive one dose of PPSV23, preferably after re- ceipt of PCV13.

This section discusses many of the common comor- bidities observed in people with diabetes but is not necessarily inclusive of all the conditions that have been reported. Autoimmune Diseases Recommendations 4.7 People with type 1 diabetes should be screened for autoimmune thyroid disease soon after diagno- sis and periodically thereafter. B 4.8 Adults with type 1 diabetes should be screened for celiac disease in the presence of gas- trointestinal symptoms, signs, laboratory manifestations, or clinical suspicion suggestive of celiac disease. B People with type 1 diabetes are at in- creased risk for other autoimmune dis- eases, with thyroid disease, celiac disease, and pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 de\ufb01- ciency) being among the most common (30). Other associated conditions include autoimmune hepatitis, primary adrenal insuf\ufb01ciency (Addison disease), collagen vascular diseases, and myasthenia gravis (31\u201334). Type 1 diabetes may also occur with other autoimmune diseases in the context of speci\ufb01c genetic disorders or polyglandular autoimmune syndromes (35). Given the high prevalence, nonspe- ci\ufb01c symptoms, and insidious onset of pri- mary hypothyroidism, routine screening for thyroid dysfunction is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes. Screening for celiac disease should be considered in adults with diabetes with suggestive symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain) or signs (e.g., osteoporosis, vitamin de\ufb01ciencies, iron de\ufb01ciency anemia) (36,37).

People with diabetes should be encouraged to undergo recommended age- and sex- appropriate cancer screenings and to re- duce their modi\ufb01able cancer risk factors (obesity, physical inactivity, and smok- ing). New onset of atypical diabetes (lean body habitus, negative family his- tory) in a middle-aged or older person may precede the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (40). However, in the absence of other symptoms (e.g., weight loss, abdominal pain), routine screening of all such individuals is not currently recommended. Cognitive Impairment/Dementia Recommendation 4.9 In the presence of cognitive impairment, diabetes treat- ment plans should be simpli- \ufb01ed as much as possible and tailored to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. B Diabetes is associated with a signi\ufb01cantly increased risk and rate of cognitive de- cline and an increased risk of dementia (41,42). A recent meta-analysis of pro- spective observational studies in people with diabetes showed 73% increased risk of all types of dementia, 56% increased risk of Alzheimer dementia, and 127% in- creased risk of vascular dementia com- pared with individuals without diabetes (43). The reverse is also true: people with Alzheimer dementia are more likely to develop diabetes than people without Alzheimer dementia. In a 15-year pro- spective study of community-dwelling people >60 years of age, the presence of diabetes at baseline signi\ufb01cantly in- creased the age- and sex-adjusted inci- dence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer dementia, and vascular dementia com- pared with rates in those with normal glucose tolerance (44).",

Hyperglycemia In those with type 2 diabetes, the de- gree and duration of hyperglycemia are related to dementia. More rapid cogni- tive decline is associated with both in- creased A1C and longer duration of diabetes (43). The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study found that each 1% higher A1C level was associated with lower cogni- tive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes (45). However, the ACCORD study found no difference in cognitive outcomes in participants randomly as- signed to intensive and standard glycemic management, supporting the recommen- dation that intensive glucose manage- ment should not be advised for the improvement of cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes (46). Hypoglycemia In type 2 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia is associated with reduced cognitive func- tion, and those with poor cognitive func- tion have more severe hypoglycemia. In a long-term study of older people with type 2 diabetes, individuals with one or more recorded episodes of severe hypoglycemia had a stepwise increase in risk of dementia (47). Likewise, the AC- CORD trial found that as cognitive func- tion decreased, the risk of severe hypoglycemia increased (48). This has also been demonstrated in people with type 1 diabetes. Tailoring glycemic ther- apy may help to prevent hypoglycemia in individuals with cognitive dysfunction (49).

Statins A systematic review has reported that data do not support an adverse effect of statins on cognition (52). The FDA post- marketing surveillance databases have also revealed a low reporting rate for cognitive function\u2013related adverse events, including cognitive dysfunction or de- mentia, with statin therapy, similar to rates seen with other commonly pre- scribed cardiovascular medications (52). Therefore, fear of cognitive decline should not be a barrier to statin use in people with diabetes and a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Recommendation 4.10 People with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with cardio- metabolic risk factors, who have either elevated liver en- zymes (ALT) or fatty liver on imaging or ultrasound, should be evaluated for presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver \ufb01brosis. C Screening Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term used to identify the broad spectrum of the disease ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver with macrovesic- ular hepatic steatosis only (or with mild in\ufb02ammation) to steatohepatitis (non- alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) to cirrhosis.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for devel- oping NASH and for disease progression and worse liver outcomes (53). Recent studies in adults in the U.S. estimate that NAFLD is prevalent in >70% of peo- ple with type 2 diabetes (54\u201356). This is consistent with studies from many other countries (57). NASH is de\ufb01ned histologi- cally as having $5% hepatic steatosis and associated with in\ufb02ammation and hepatocyte injury (hepatocyte balloon- ing), with or without evidence of liver \ufb01brosis (58). Steatohepatitis is estimated to affect more than half of people with type 2 diabetes with NAFLD (59), and it appears to be a driver for the develop- ment of \ufb01brosis. Fibrosis stages are clas- si\ufb01ed histologically as the following: F0, no \ufb01brosis; F1, mild; F2, moderate (sig- ni\ufb01cant); F3, severe (advanced); and F4, cirrhosis. In the U.S., between 12% and 20% of people with type 2 diabetes have clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis ($F2) (54,55,59), similar to that observed worldwide (53,57).

Still, clinicians underestimate its prevalence and do not consistently implement appropriate screening strate- gies, thus missing the diagnosis of NAFLD in high-risk groups, such as those having obesity or type 2 diabetes. This pattern of underdiagnosis is compounded by sparse referral to specialists and inade- quate prescription of medications with proven ef\ufb01cacy in NASH (63,64). The goal of screening is not to identify steatosis per se (being already highly prevalent in this population) but rather to use it to identify those on a disease path of future cirrhosis. This risk is higher in people who have obesity and cardio- metabolic risk factors or insulin resistance, are >50 years of age, and/or have persis- tently elevated plasma aminotransferases (AST and/or ALT >30 units/L for more >6 months) (65,66). Some genetic var- iants that alter hepatocyte triglyceride metabolism may also increase the risk of NASH progression and cirrhosis (67,68), amplifying the impact of obesity, but the role of genetic testing in clinical practice remains to be established. Individuals with clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01- brosis ($F2), especially those with type 2 diabetes, have a greater risk of cirrhosis with liver decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation, and all-cause mortality (69\u201372). Excess mortality associated with NAFLD is attributable not only to cirrho- sis and HCC but also to extrahepatic cancer (61), type 2 diabetes (73), and cardiovascular disease (74,75).

Emerging evidence suggests that NAFLD increases the risk of chronic kidney disease, particularly when liver \ufb01brosis is present (76,77), although the association of NAFLD with diabetic retinopathy is less clear (78). Therefore, early diagnosis is essential to prevent fu- ture cirrhosis. A recent meta-analysis reported a preva- lence of NAFLD of 22% in people with type 1 diabetes (79). This risk may be linked to the fact that about one-third in the U.S. have obesity (80). However, there was a large variability across studies, and most measured liver fat by ultrasound. In one of the few studies using the gold- standard MRI technique to quantitate liver fat, the prevalence of steatosis in a population with type 1 diabetes with low prevalence of obesity was only 8.8% compared with 68% in people with type 2 diabetes (81). The prevalence of \ufb01brosis was not established. Therefore, screening for \ufb01brosis in people with type 1 diabe- tes should only be considered in the presence of additional risk factors for NAFLD, such as obesity, incidental he- patic steatosis on imaging, or elevated plasma aminotransferases. There is consensus that the \ufb01brosis-4 index (FIB-4) is the most cost-effective strategy for the initial screening of peo- ple with prediabetes and cardiometa- bolic risk factors or type 2 diabetes in the primary care and diabetes clinical setting (58,64\u201366,82\u201384).

The American College of Gastroen- terology considers the upper limit of nor- mal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female individuals (87), as higher levels are associated with increased liver- related mortality, even in the absence of identi\ufb01able risk factors. The FIB-4 esti- mates the risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count (mdcalc.com/calc/ 2200/\ufb01brosis-4-\ufb01b-4-index-liver-\ufb01brosis). A value of <1.3 is considered lower risk, while >2.67 is considered as having a high probability of advanced \ufb01brosis (F3\u2013F4). It also predicts changes over time in hepatic \ufb01brosis (88,89) and al- lows risk strati\ufb01cation of individuals in terms of future liver-related morbidity and mortality (90,91).

It has a reasonable speci\ufb01city and negative predictive value to rule out advanced \ufb01brosis but lacks ade- quate sensitivity and positive predic- tive value to establish presence of advanced \ufb01brosis in many cases, which is the reason why people with diabetes often fall in the \u201cindeterminate risk\u201d group for establishing the advanced \ufb01brosis (or intermediate) group (between 1.3 and 2.67).

In people with diabe- tes $65 years of age, higher cutoffs for FIB-4 have been recommended (1.9\u20132.0 rather than >1.3) (96,97). In people with an indeterminate or high FIB-4, additional risk strati\ufb01cation is required with a liver stiffness measure- ment (LSM) by transient elastography (Fig. 4.2) or, if unavailable, by commer- cial blood \ufb01brosis biomarkers such as the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test (98) or others. Use of a second non- proprietary diagnostic panel is not rec- ommended (i.e., NAFLD \ufb01brosis score, others), as they generally do not perform better than FIB-4 (56,92). Transient elas- tography (LSM) is the best-validated imaging technique for \ufb01brosis risk strati- \ufb01cation, and it predicts future cirrhosis and all-cause mortality in NAFLD (58,65,99). An LSM value of <8.0 kPa has a good negative predictive value to exclude ad- vanced \ufb01brosis ($F3\u2013F4) (100\u2013102) and indicates low risk for clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis. Such individuals with diabetes can be followed in nonspecialty clinics with repeat surveillance testing every $2 years. If the LSM is >12 kPa, the risk for advanced \ufb01brosis is high and people with diabetes should be referred to the hepatologist (100). FIB-4 followed by LSM helps stratify people with diabe- tes by risk level and minimize referrals to the specialist (91,94,99,103,104) (Fig. 4.2). Specialists may order additional tests for \ufb01brosis risk strati\ufb01cation (64\u201366,84, 99), with magnetic resonance elastogra- phy having the best overall performance (particularly for early \ufb01brosis stages).",

The American Gastroenterological As- sociation convened an international con- ference, including representatives of the ADA, to review and discuss published literature on the burden, screening, risk strati\ufb01cation, diagnosis, and manage- ment of individuals with NAFLD (64). See Fig. 4.2, which is reproduced from this special report (64). A Clinical Care Pathway summarized the diagnosis and management of NAFLD in a subsequent publication (66). Consensus is emerging to start screening with FIB-4 followed by LSM and/or patented biomarkers for the noninvasive \ufb01brosis risk strati\ufb01cation of individuals with NAFLD in primary care and diabetes clinics (58,64\u201366,82\u201384). After initial risk strati\ufb01cation (i.e., FIB-4, LSM, and/or patented biomarkers), peo- ple with diabetes at indeterminate or high risk of \ufb01brosis should be referred, based on practice setting, to a gastroen- terologist or hepatologist for further workup within the framework of a mul- tidisciplinary team (64,105,106). Management While steatohepatitis and cirrhosis oc- cur in lean people with diabetes and are believed to be linked to genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, and environmental factors (107\u2013109), there is ample evidence to implicate excess adiposity in people with overweight and obesity in the pathogenesis of the dis- ease (110,111).

A minimum weight loss goal of 5%, preferably $10% (113,114), is needed to improve liver his- tology, with \ufb01brosis requiring the larger weight reduction to change (114\u2013116). Individualized, structured weight loss and exercise programs offer greater bene\ufb01t than standard counseling in people with NAFLD (107,117). Dietary recommendations to induce an energy de\ufb01cit are not different than those for people with diabetes with obe- sity without NAFLD and should include a reduction of macronutrient content, lim- iting saturated fat, starch, and added sugar, with adoption of healthier eating patterns. The Mediterranean diet has the best evidence for improving liver and cardiometabolic health (58,65,82,83,117\u2013 121). Both aerobic and resistance training improve NAFLD in proportion to treat- ment engagement and intensity of the program (122\u2013124). Obesity pharmacotherapy may assist with weight loss in the context of life- style modi\ufb01cation if not achieved by life- style modi\ufb01cation alone. Bariatric surgery improves NASH and cardiometabolic health, altering the nat- ural history of the disease (125). Meta- analyses report that 70\u201380% of people have improvement in hepatic steatosis, 50\u201375% in in\ufb02ammation and hepato- cyte ballooning (necrosis), and 30\u201340% in \ufb01brosis (126,127). It may also reduce the risk of HCC (127). Bariatric surgery should be used with caution in individu- als with compensated cirrhosis, but in experienced hands the risk of hepatic decompensation is similar to that for those with less advanced liver disease. Because of the paucity of safety and outcome data, bariatric surgery is not recommended in individuals with decompensated cirrhosis who also",

At present, there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of NASH. There- fore, treatment for people with type 2 di- abetes and NASH is centered on the dual purpose of treating hyperglycemia and obesity, especially if clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01- brosis ($F2) is present. The rationale for the treatment of people with type 2 dia- betes is based on their high prevalence of NASH with signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis (10\u201315% of people with type 2 diabetes) (54,55,57), their higher risk of disease progression and liver-related mortality (53,72,128), and the lack of pharmaco- logical treatments once cirrhosis is established (129). Therefore, early diag- nosis and treatment of NAFLD offers the best opportunity for cirrhosis pre- vention. Pioglitazone and some glucagon- like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been shown to be effective to treat steatohepatitis (64,65,130\u2013132) and may slow \ufb01brosis progression (133\u2013135) and decrease cardiovascular disease (65,131), which is the number one cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD (74). Pioglitazone improves glucose and lipid metabolism and reverses steatohepatitis in people with prediabetes, type 2 diabe- tes (136,137), or even without diabetes (138\u2013140). Fibrosis also improved in some trials (137,139). A meta-analysis (133) con- cluded that pioglitazone treatment results in resolution of NASH and may improve \ufb01brosis.

Pioglitazone causes dose-dependent weight gain (15 mg/day, mean of 1\u20132%; 45 mg/day, 3\u20135%), increases fracture risk, may promote heart failure if used in individuals with preexisting conges- tive heart failure, and may increase the risk of bladder cancer, although this remains controversial (64,65,131, 132). GLP-1 RAs are effective in inducing weight loss and ameliorating elevated plasma aminotransferases and steatosis (130). However, there are only two RCTs in biopsy-proven individuals with NASH. A small RCT reported that liraglutide im- proved some features of NASH and, of particular relevance, delayed the pro- gression of \ufb01brosis (143). More recently, once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide in 320 people with biopsy-proven NASH (62% having type 2 diabetes) reported resolution of steatohepatitis in 59% at the higher dose (equivalent to 2.4 mg/week semaglutide) compared with 17% in the placebo group (P < 0.001) (135).

Tirzepatide (144), sodium\u2013 glucose cotransporter inhibitors (145\u2013147), and insulin (132) reduce hepatic steatosis, but their effects on steatohepatitis remain unknown.

Dia- betes is a risk factor for severe disease and death from COVID-19. Reasons for the higher rates of COVID-19 and severity in minority ethnic groups are complex and could be due to higher prevalence of comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes), differences in exposure risk (e.g., overcrowded living conditions, essential worker jobs), and access to treatment (e.g., health insurance status, specialist services, and medications), which all relate to long-standing structural in- equities that vary by ethnicity (167).

Whether new-onset di- abetes is likely to remain permanent or is more aggressive is not known, and it will be important for health care profes- sionals to monitor these people in the longer term. One large U.S. retrospective study of over 27 million people reported that COVID-19 was associated with sig- ni\ufb01cantly increased risk of new-onset type 1 diabetes and a disproportionately higher risk in ethnic minority people (171). Another recent cross-sectional population\u2013based Canadian study ob- served a slightly higher but nonsigni\ufb01- cant increase in diabetes incidence in children during the pandemic, suggesting this resulted from delays in diagnosis early during the pandemic with a catch- up effect (172). Whether COVID-19 leads to new-onset diabetes is not known. There have been several publications on the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during the pandemic. A German diabetes prospective study using registry data of children and adolescents found an increase in type 1 diabetes in the \ufb01rst 3 months of the \ufb01rst wave, and the fre- quency of DKA at presentation was sig- ni\ufb01cantly higher than those for 2019 (44.7% vs. 24.5%, adjusted risk ratio 1.84) and 2018 (vs. 24.1%, adjusted risk ratio 1.85) as well as the propor- tion with severe DKA (173). A larger study using national data in England during the \ufb01rst two waves found",

The study reported lower DKA hospital admissions in people with type 1 diabetes but higher rates of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes and those newly diagnosed with diabetes. There is also evidence of adverse ef- fects of COVID-19 on mental health (175) and health-promoting lifestyles during the pandemic. Some small studies in people with diabetes have reported longer-term psychological impact of SARS-CoV-2 in- fection in people with diabetes, including fatigue and risk of suicide (176). Longitu- dinal follow-up of the Look AHEAD study of older adults with type 2 diabetes re- ported a 1.6-fold higher prevalence for depressive symptoms and 1.8-fold higher prevalence for loneliness during the pandemic compared with prepandemic levels (177). Furthermore, people with diabetes remain fearful of attending face- to-face contact due to the possible threat from mutant strains of corona- virus (178). Negative emotions due to the pandemic, including lockdowns, have been associated with reduced motiva- tion, physical inactivity, and sedentary behavior (179). Higher levels of pandemic- related distress have been linked to higher A1C (180). Greater pandemic-related life disruptions have been related to higher distress in parents of youth with diabe- tes, which may have impacted families from racial and ethnic minority groups to a greater degree than non-Hispanic White families (181). On the other hand, for some youth with type 1 diabetes, increased time at home during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic",

Due to unemployment or lost income during the pandemic, people living with diabetes have expe- rienced \ufb01nancial hardships that may have reduced their affordability for medi- cations in countries where costs for medi- cations are out of pocket (184). Many individuals with diabetes have avoided or delayed seeking medical attention for routine non-COVID-19\u2013related prob- lems due to fear of infection and/or to reduce strain on health care services (187). Disruptions in care delivery and completion of care processes have been associated with an increased risk of non- COVID-19\u2013related deaths in people with diabetes (188). Direct contact will still be necessary if blood tests or physical examinations are required. However, it will be important to ensure that disparities are not wid- ened for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and socieconomically challenged and ethnic minority groups due to ac- cess to literacy. As we recover from the pandemic, it is essential that we prioritize the highest- risk groups for their routine review and assessment as well as management of their mental/behavioral health and risk factors. Diabetes professional bodies in some countries have published guidance on risk strati\ufb01cation and who to prioritize for diabetes review (189,190). Factors to consider for prioritization should include demographics, socioeconomical status, education levels, established complica- tions, comorbidities, and modi\ufb01able risk factors, which are associated with high risk of progression of diabetes-related complications. In many countries, health care profes- sionals have reduced face-to-face contact",

One small RCT in adults with type 2 diabetes with follow-up to 16 weeks showed that remote consultations during the pandemic re- duced the prevalence of mental health- and diabetes-related emotional distress (191). The number of face-to-face ap- pointments is now increasing, and hybrid models with both virtual and face-to- face consultations are likely to remain (192). Technological interventions such as telehealth in people with diabetes may be a solution to improve care and clinical outcomes (193). However, such technological interventions may fur- ther widen disparities in vulnerable popu- lations such as the elderly, ethnic minority groups, frail populations, and those from deprived communities (194). Several pharmacoepidemiological stud- ies have examined the association be- tween glucose-lowering medications and risk of COVID-19 and have reported con- \ufb02icting \ufb01ndings, although most studies showed a lower risk of mortality with metformin and a higher risk in people on insulin. However, the absolute differ- ences in the risks have been small, and these \ufb01ndings could be due to con- founding by indication (195). The gold standard for assessing the effects of therapies is by RCT, and only one RCT, the Dapagli\ufb02ozin in Patients with Cardio- metabolic Risk Factors Hospitalized with COVID-19 (DARE-19), a double-blind, pla- cebo-controlled RCT in people with and without type 2 diabetes with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, has been reported (196).

Great progress has been made glob- ally to develop vaccines against SARS- CoV-2, and RCT data and real-world data show that vaccines have led to reduced infections, transmission, hospitalization, and mortality. It is therefore important that people with diabetes have regular SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (see IMMUNIZATIONS, above, for detailed information on COVID-19 vaccines). It is unclear currently how often people with diabetes will require booster vac- cines. Though limited data are available on COVID-19 vaccination attitudes or up- take in people with diabetes in the U.S. (197), diabetes health care professionals may be in a position to address ques- tions and concerns among people with diabetes and encourage vaccination.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing a decision-making education and skill-building program (10) showed that addressing these targets improved health outcomes in a population in need of health care resources. Furthermore, fol- lowing a DSMES curriculum improves quality of care (11). Additionally, in response to the grow- ing body of evidence that associates po- tentially judgmental words with increased feelings of shame and guilt, health care professionals are encouraged to consider the impact that language has on building therapeutic relationships and to choose positive, strength-based words and phrases that put people \ufb01rst (4,12).

Ongoing DSMES helps people with diabetes to maintain effective self- management throughout the life course as they encounter new challenges and as advances in treatment become available (14). There are four critical time points when the need for DSMES should be evaluated by the health care profes- sional and/or multidisciplinary team, with referrals made as needed (2): 1. At diagnosis 2. Annually and/or when not meeting treatment targets 3. When complicating factors (health conditions, physical limitations, emo- tional factors, or basic living needs) de- velop that in\ufb02uence self-management 4. When transitions in life and care occur DSMES focuses on empowering indi- viduals with diabetes by providing people with diabetes the tools to make informed self-management decisions (15). DSMES should be person-centered. This is an approach that places the person with dia- betes and their family and/or support system at the center of the care model, working in collaboration with health care professionals. Person-centered care is re- spectful of and responsive to individual preferences, needs, and values. It ensures that the values of the person with diabetes guide all decision-making (16). Evidence for the Benefits DSMES is associated with improved dia- betes knowledge and self-care behav- iors (17), lower A1C (17\u201321), lower self- reported weight (22), improved quality of life (19,23,24), reduced all-cause mortal- ity risk (25), positive coping behaviors (5,26), and reduced health care costs (27\u201329). DSMES is associated with an in- creased use of primary care and preven- tive services (27,30,31) and less frequent",

People with diabetes who participate in DSMES are more likely to follow best practice treatment recom- mendations, particularly those with Medicare, and have lower Medicare and insurance claim costs (28,31). Better out- comes were reported for DSMES inter- ventions that were more than 10 h over the course of 6\u201312 months (20), included ongoing support (14,32), were culturally (33\u201335) and age appropriate (36,37), were tailored to individual needs and preferences, addressed psychosocial is- sues, and incorporated behavioral strat- egies (15,26,38,39). Individual and group approaches are effective (40\u201342), with a slight bene\ufb01t realized by those who en- gage in both (20). Strong evidence now exists on the bene\ufb01ts of virtual, telehealth, or internet-based DSMES services for dia- betes prevention and management in a wide variety of populations (43\u201354). Technologies such as mobile apps, sim- ulation tools, digital coaching, and digital self-management interventions can also be used to deliver DSMES (55\u201360). These methods provide comparable or even im- proved outcomes compared with tra- ditional in-person care (61).

Technology-enabled diabetes self- management solutions improve A1C most effectively when there is two-way communication between the person with diabetes and the health care team, individualized feedback, use of person- generated health data, and education (46). Continuous glucose monitoring, when combined with individualized diabe- tes education or behavioral interventions, has demonstrated greater improvement on glycemic and psychosocial outcomes compared with continuous glucose moni- toring alone (63,64). Incorporating a systematic approach for technology assessment, adoption, and integration into the care plan may help ensure eq- uity in access and standardized appli- cation of technology-enabled solutions (8, 30,65\u201367). Research supports diabetes care and education specialists (DCES), including nurses, registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs), and pharmacists as providers of DSMES who may also tailor curriculum to the person\u2019s needs (68\u201370). Many other health disciplines can also become DCES. Members of the DSMES team should have specialized clinical knowl- edge in diabetes and behavior change principles. In addition, a DCES needs to be knowledgeable about technology- enabled services and may serve as a tech- nology champion within their practice (65). Certi\ufb01cation as a DCES (cbdce.org/) and/or board certi\ufb01cation in advanced di- abetes management (diabeteseducator. org/education/certi\ufb01cation/bc_adm) demonstrates an individual\u2019s specialized training in and understanding of diabetes management and support (43), and en- gagement with quali\ufb01ed professionals has been shown to improve disease-related outcomes. Additionally, there is growing evidence for the role of community health workers (71,72), as well as peer (71\u201376) and lay leaders",

    "text": "(77), in providing ongoing support. Given individual needs and access to resources, a variety of culturally adapted DSMES programs need to be offered in a variety of settings. The use of technology to facilitate access to DSMES services, support self-management decisions, and decrease therapeutic inertia suggests that these approaches need broader adoption (78). Additionally, it is important to include social determinants of health (SDOH) of the target population in guid- ing design and delivery of DSMES. The DSMES team should take into account demographic characteristics such as race, ethnic/cultural background, sex/gender, age, geographic location, technology ac- cess, education, literacy, and numeracy (43,79). Despite the bene\ufb01ts of DSMES, reports indicate that only 5\u20137% of individuals eli- gible for DSMES through Medicare or a private insurance plan actually receive it (80,81). Barriers to DSMES exist at the health system, payer, health care profes- sional, and individual levels. This low par- ticipation may be due to lack of referral or other identi\ufb01ed barriers, such as logis- tical issues (accessibility, timing, costs) and the lack of a perceived bene\ufb01t (81). Health system, programmatic, and payer barriers include lack of administrative leadership support, limited numbers of DSMES professionals, not having referral to DSMES services effectively embedded in the health system service structure, and limited reimbursement rates (82). Thus, in addition to educating referring health care professionals about the ben- e\ufb01ts of DSMES and the critical times to refer, efforts need to be made to identify and address all of the various potential barriers (2).

Reimbursement Medicare reimburses DSMES when that service meets the national stand- ards (2,43) and is recognized by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) through the Education Recognition Program (professional.diabetes.org/ diabetes-education) or Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists (diabeteseducator.org/practice/diabetes- education-accreditation-program). DSMES is also covered by most health insurance plans. Ongoing support has been shown to be instrumental for improving out- comes when it is implemented after the completion of education services. DSMES is frequently reimbursed when performed in person. However, although DSMES can also be provided via phone calls and tele- health, these remote versions may not always be reimbursed (13). Medicare re- imburses remote physiologic monitoring for glucose and other cardiometabolic data if certain conditions are met (83). Changes in reimbursement policies that increase DSMES access and utilization will result in a positive impact to bene\ufb01ciaries\u2019 clinical outcomes, quality of life, health care utilization, and costs (13,84\u201386). Dur- ing the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reimburse- ment policies were revised (professional. diabetes.org/content-page/dsmes-and- mnt-during-covid-19-national-pandemic), and these changes may provide a new re- imbursement paradigm for future provision of",

Disor- dered eating, eating disorders, and/or dis- rupted eating can increase challenges for weight and diabetes management. For example, caloric restriction may be es- sential for glycemic management and weight maintenance, but rigid meal plans may be contraindicated for individuals who are at increased risk of clinically sig- ni\ufb01cant maladaptive eating behaviors (118).

Any ap- proach to meal planning should be indi- vidualized, considering the health status, personal preferences, and ability of the person with diabetes to sustain the rec- ommendations in the plan. Eating Patterns and Meal Planning Evidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbo- hydrate, protein, and fat for people with diabetes. Therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on an indi- vidualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. Dietary guidance should empha- size the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than focusing on individual nutrients, foods, or food groups, given that individuals rarely eat foods in isolation. Personal preferences (e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs and goals, economics), as well as metabolic goals, need to be considered when working with individuals to deter- mine the best eating pattern (70,97,130). Members of the health care team should complement MNT by providing evidence- based guidance that helps people with di- abetes make healthy food choices that meet their individualized needs and improve overall health. A variety of eat- ing patterns are acceptable for the man- agement of diabetes (70,97,131,132). Health care professionals should focus on the core dimensions common among the patterns: 1) emphasize nonstarchy vegetables, 2) minimize added sugars and re\ufb01ned grains, and 3) choose whole foods over highly processed foods to the extent possible (70).

For individuals with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or for whom reducing glucose-lowering drugs is a priority, reducing overall carbohy- drate intake with a low- or very- low-carbohydrate eating pattern is a vi- able option (137\u2013139). As research stud- ies on low-carbohydrate eating plans generally indicate challenges with long- term sustainability (143), it is important to reassess and individualize meal plan guidance regularly for those interested in this approach. In response to questions regarding implementation of low-carbohy- drate and very-low-carbohydrate eating patterns, the ADA has developed a guide for health care professionals that may as- sist in the practical implementation of these eating patterns (144). Most individ- uals with diabetes report a moderate in- take of carbohydrates (44\u201346% of total calories) (97,144). Efforts to modify habit- ual eating patterns are often unsuccessful in the long term; people generally go back to their usual macronutrient distri- bution (97). Thus, the recommended ap- proach is to individualize meal plans with a macronutrient distribution that is more consistent with personal preference and usual intake to increase the likelihood for long-term maintenance. An RCT found that two meal-planning approaches (diabetes plate method and carbohydrate counting) were effective in helping achieve improved A1C (145). The diabetes plate method is a com- monly used visual approach for provid- ing basic meal planning guidance. This simple graphic (featuring a 9-inch plate) shows how to portion foods (1/2 of the plate for nonstarchy vegetables, 1/4 of the plate",

Carbohydrate counting is a more advanced skill that helps plan for and track how much carbo- hydrate is consumed at meals and snacks. Meal planning approaches should be customized to the individual, including their numeracy (145) and food literacy level. Food literacy generally describes pro\ufb01ciency in food-related knowledge and skills that ultimately impact health, al- though speci\ufb01c de\ufb01nitions vary across initiatives (146,147). There has been an increased interest in time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting as strategies for weight manage- ment. Intermittent fasting is an umbrella term which includes three main forms of restricted eating: alternate-day fasting (energy restriction of 500\u2013600 calories on alternate days), the 5:2 diet (energy restriction of 500\u2013600 calories on con- secutive or nonconsecutive days) with usual intake the other \ufb01ve, and time- restricted eating (daily calorie restriction based on window of time of 8\u201315 h). Each produces mild to moderate weight loss (3\u20138% loss from baseline) over short durations (8\u201312 weeks) with no signi\ufb01- cant differences in weight loss when com- pared with continuous calorie restriction (148\u2013151). A few studies have extended up to 52 weeks and show similar \ufb01nd- ings (152\u2013155). Time-restricted eating (shortening the eating window) is gen- erally easier to follow compared with al- ternative-day fasting or the 5:2 plan, largely due to ease, no need to count calories, sustainability, and feasibility. This may have implications as people with diabetes are looking for practical eating management tools. Carbohydrates Studies examining the ideal amount of",

The literature concerning gly- cemic index and glycemic load in indi- viduals with diabetes is complex, often with varying de\ufb01nitions of low- and high- glycemic-index foods (158,159). The gly- cemic index ranks carbohydrate foods on their postprandial glycemic response, and glycemic load takes into account both the glycemic index of foods and the amount of carbohydrate eaten. Studies have found mixed results regarding the effect of glycemic index and glycemic load on fasting glucose levels and A1C, with one systematic review \ufb01nding no signi\ufb01cant impact on A1C (160) while others demonstrated A1C reductions of 0.15% (158) to 0.5% (161,162). Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demon- strated evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences (70). For people with type 2 diabetes, low-carbohydrate and very- low-carbohydrate eating patterns in par- ticular have been found to reduce A1C and the need for antihyperglycemic med- ications (70,130,143,163\u2013165). System- atic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs found carbohydrate-restricted eating pat- terns, particularly those considered low carbohydrate (<26% total energy), were effective in reducing A1C in the short term (<6 months), with less difference in eating patterns beyond 1 year (125,126, 137,138,164). Questions still remain about the optimal degree of carbohydrate re- striction and the long-term effects of those meal patterns on cardiovascular disease.

This systematic review highlights the metabolic complex- ity of response to dietary intervention in type 2 diabetes as well as the need to better understand longer-term sustain- ability and results (166). Part of the chal- lenge in interpreting low-carbohydrate research has been due to the wide range of de\ufb01nitions for a low-carbohydrate eat- ing plan (139,161). Weight reduction was also a goal in many low-carbohydrate studies, which further complicates evalu- ating the distinct contribution of the eat- ing pattern (47,121,125,167). The quality of carbohydrate and/or what is absent from the diet may contrib- ute to confounding results. However, when core dimensions of the comparative diets are similar, there is little difference in outcome measures. When Gardner et al. (168) tested a low-carbohydrate keto- genic diet and a low-carbohydrate Medi- terranean diet, in a randomized crossover design, metabolic improvements were seen in both diets without signi\ufb01cant dif- ferences between them.

Legumes, fruits, and whole in- tact grains were included in the Mediter- ranean but not in the ketogenic diet.

Health care pro- fessionals should maintain consistent medical oversight and recognize that in- sulin and other diabetes medications may need to be adjusted to prevent hypoglycemia, and blood pressure will need to be monitored. In addition, very- low-carbohydrate eating plans are not currently recommended for individuals who are pregnant or lactating, children, people who have renal disease, or peo- ple with or at risk for disordered eating, and these plans should be used with caution in those taking sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors because of the potential risk of ketoacidosis (169,170). Regardless of amount of carbohydrate in the meal plan, focus should be placed on high-quality, nutrient-dense carbohy- drate sources that are high in \ufb01ber and minimally processed. The addition of die- tary \ufb01ber modulates composition of gut microbiota and increases gut microbial diversity. Although there is still much to be elucidated with the gut microbiome and chronic disease, higher-\ufb01ber diets are advantageous (171).

The consump- tion of sugar-sweetened beverages and processed food products with large amoun- ts of re\ufb01ned grains and added sugars is strongly discouraged (172,178,179), as these have the capacity to displace health- ier, more nutrient-dense food choices.

For people whose meal schedule or car- bohydrate consumption is variable, regu- lar education to increase understanding of the relationship between carbohy- drate intake and insulin needs is impor- tant. In addition, education on using insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios for meal planning can assist individuals with effec- tively modifying insulin dosing from meal to meal to improve glycemic manage- ment (97,156,180\u2013183). Studies have shown that dietary fat and protein can impact early and delayed postprandial gly- cemia (184\u2013187), and it appears to have a dose-dependent response (188\u2013191). Results from high-fat, high-protein meal studies highlight the need for additional insulin to cover these meals; however, more studies are needed to determine the optimal insulin dose and delivery strategy. The results",

The effectiveness of insulin dosing decisions should be con\ufb01rmed with a structured approach to blood glucose monitoring or continuous glucose moni- toring to evaluate individual responses and guide insulin dose adjustments. Checking glucose 3 h after eating may help to determine if additional insulin adjustments are required (i.e., increas- ing or stopping bolus) (185,192,193). Re\ufb01ning insulin doses to account for high-fat and/or -protein meals requires determination of anticipated nutrient intake to calculate the mealtime dose. Food literacy, numeracy, interest, and ca- pability should be evaluated (70). For indi- viduals on a \ufb01xed daily insulin schedule, meal planning should emphasize a rela- tively \ufb01xed carbohydrate consumption pattern with respect to both time and amount while considering insulin action. Attention to resultant hunger and satiety cues will also help with nutrient modi\ufb01ca- tions throughout the day (70,194). Protein There is no evidence that adjusting the daily level of protein intake (typically 1\u20131.5 g/kg body wt/day or 15\u201320% total calories) will improve health, and re- search is inconclusive regarding the ideal amount of dietary protein to optimize either glycemic management or CVD risk (159,195). Therefore, protein intake goals should be individualized based on current eating patterns. Some research has found successful management of type 2 diabetes with meal plans including slightly higher levels of protein (20\u201330%), which may contribute to increased satiety (196). Historically, low-protein eating plans were advised for individuals with dia- betic kidney disease (DKD) (with albumin- uria and/or reduced estimated",

Reducing the amount of dietary pro- tein below the recommended daily allow- ance of 0.8 g/kg is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic meas- ures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the rate at which glomerular \ufb01ltration rate de- clines and may increase risk for malnutri- tion (197,198). In individuals with type 2 diabetes, protein intake may enhance or increase the insulin response to dietary carbohy- drates (199). Therefore, use of carbohy- drate sources high in protein (e.g., nuts) to treat or prevent hypoglycemia should be avoided due to the potential concur- rent rise in endogenous insulin. Health care professionals should counsel pa- tients to treat hypoglycemia with pure glucose (i.e., glucose tablets) or carbo- hydrate-containing foods at the hypogly- cemia alert value of <70 mg/dL. See Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for more information. Fats Evidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from fat for people with or at risk for diabetes and that macronutrient distribution should be individualized according to the patient\u2019s eating patterns, preferences, and meta- bolic goals (70). The type of fats con- sumed is more important than total amount of fat when looking at metabolic goals and CVD risk, and it is recom- mended that the percentage of total cal- ories from saturated fats should be limited (120,172,200\u2013202).

The Mediterranean eating pattern is based on the traditional eating habits in the countries bordering the Mediterra- nean Sea. Although eating styles vary, they share a number of common features, including consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts/ seeds; olive oil as the primary fat source; low to moderate amounts of \ufb01sh, eggs, and poultry; and limited added sugars, sugary beverages, sodium, highly proc- essed foods, re\ufb01ned carbohydrates, satu- rated fats, and fatty or processed meats. Evidence does not conclusively support recommending n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements for all people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardio- vascular events (70,209,210). In individuals with type 2 diabetes, two systematic reviews with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids concluded that the dietary supplements did not improve glycemic management (159,211).

People with diabetes should be advised to follow the guidelines for the general population for the recommended in- takes of saturated fat, dietary choles- terol, and trans fat (172). Trans fats should be avoided. In addition, as satu- rated fats are progressively decreased in the diet, they should be replaced with unsaturated fats and not with re- \ufb01ned carbohydrates (207). Sodium As for the general population, people with diabetes are advised to limit their sodium consumption to <2,300 mg/day (70). Restriction to <1,500 mg, even for those with hypertension, is generally not recommended (214\u2013216).

In addition, there is insuf\ufb01cient evidence to support the routine use of herbal sup- plements and micronutrients, such as cin- namon (220), curcumin, vitamin D (221), aloe vera, or chromium, to improve glyce- mia in people with diabetes (70,222). Although the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes Study (D2d) prospective RCT showed no signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t of vitamin D versus placebo on the progression to type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk (223), post hoc analyses and meta- analyses suggest a potential bene\ufb01t in speci\ufb01c populations (223\u2013226).

Nonnutritive Sweeteners The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved many nonnutritive sweet- eners for consumption by the general public, including people with diabetes (70,227). For some people with diabetes who are accustomed to regularly consum- ing sugar-sweetened products, nonnutri- tive sweeteners (containing few or no calories) may be an acceptable substitute for nutritive sweeteners (those containing calories, such as sugar, honey, and agave syrup) when consumed in moderation (228,229). Nonnutritive sweeteners do not appear to have a signi\ufb01cant effect on glycemic management (97,230,231), and they can reduce overall calorie and carbo- hydrate intake (97,228) as long as individ- uals are not compensating with additional calories from other food sources (70,232).

Exercise is a more speci\ufb01c form of physical activity that is structured and designed to im- prove physical \ufb01tness. Both physical activ- ity and exercise are important. Exercise has been shown to improve blood glu- cose levels, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, contribute to weight loss, and improve well-being (240). Physical activ- ity is as important for those with type 1 diabetes as it is for the general popula- tion, but its speci\ufb01c role in the preven- tion of diabetes complications and the management of blood glucose is not as clear as it is for those with type 2 diabe- tes.

It is important for diabetes care management teams to understand the dif\ufb01culty that many people have reaching recommended treatment tar- gets and to identify individualized ap- proaches to improve goal achievement, which may need to change over time. Moderate to high volumes of aerobic activity are associated with substantially lower cardiovascular and overall mortal- ity risks in both type 1 and type 2 dia- betes (244).

Certainly, those with high risk should be encouraged to start with short periods of low-intensity exercise and slowly increase the intensity and duration as tolerated. Health care professionals should assess for conditions that might contraindicate certain types of exercise or predispose to injury, such as uncontrolled hyperten- sion, untreated proliferative retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neu- ropathy, and a history of foot ulcers or Charcot foot.

Autonomic Neuropathy Autonomic neuropathy can increase the risk of exercise-induced injury or adverse events through decreased cardiac respon- siveness to exercise, postural hypotension, impaired thermoregulation, impaired night vision due to impaired papillary re- action, and greater susceptibility to hypo- glycemia (277). Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death and silent myocardial ischemia (278). Therefore, in- dividuals with diabetic autonomic neurop- athy should undergo cardiac investigation before beginning physical activity more intense than that to which they are accustomed. Diabetic Kidney Disease Physical activity can acutely increase urinary albumin excretion. However, there is no evidence that vigorous-in- tensity exercise accelerates the rate of progression of DKD, and there appears to be no need for speci\ufb01c exercise re- strictions for people with DKD in gen- eral (274).

A 5.35 After identi\ufb01cation of tobacco or e-cigarette use, include smoking cessation counseling and other forms of treatment as a routine component of diabetes care. A 5.36 Address smoking cessation as part of diabetes education programs for those in need. B Results from epidemiologic, case-control, and cohort studies provide convincing evidence to support the causal link be- tween cigarette smoking and health risks (279). Data show tobacco use is higher among adults with chronic conditions (280) as well as in adolescents and young adults with diabetes (281). People with di- abetes who smoke (and people with dia- betes exposed to second-hand smoke) have a heightened risk of CVD, premature death, microvascular complications, and worse glycemic outcomes when com- pared with those who do not smoke (282\u2013284). Smoking may have a role in the development of type 2 diabetes (285\u2013287). The routine and thorough assessment of tobacco use is essential to prevent smoking or encourage cessation. Numer- ous large RCTs have demonstrated the ef\ufb01cacy and cost-effectiveness of brief counseling in smoking cessation, includ- ing the use of telephone quit lines, in reducing tobacco use. Pharmacologic ther- apy to assist with smoking cessation in people with diabetes has been shown to be effective (288), and for people who are motivated to quit, the addition of pharma- cologic therapy to counseling is more ef- fective than either treatment alone (289). Special considerations should",

Although some people may gain weight in the period shortly after smoking cessation (291), re- cent research has demonstrated that this weight gain does not diminish the sub- stantial CVD bene\ufb01t realized from smoking cessation (292). One study in people who smoke who had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes found that smoking cessation was associated with amelioration of meta- bolic parameters and reduced blood pres- sure and albuminuria at 1 year (293). In recent years, e-cigarettes have gained public awareness and popularity because of perceptions that e-cigarette use is less harmful than regular cigarette smoking (294,295). However, in light of recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evidence (296) of deaths re- lated to e-cigarette use, no individuals should be advised to use e-cigarettes, ei- ther as a way to stop smoking tobacco or as a recreational drug. Diabetes education programs offer po- tential to systematically reach and engage individuals with diabetes in smoking ces- sation efforts. A cluster randomized trial found statistically signi\ufb01cant increases in quit rates and long-term abstinence rates (>6 months) when smoking cessation interventions were offered through dia- betes education clinics, regardless of motivation to quit at baseline (297).

A Given associations with glycemic out- comes and risk for future complications (298,299), it is important for diabetes care professionals to support people with diabetes to engage in health- promoting behaviors (preventive, treat- ment, and maintenance), including blood glucose monitoring, taking insulin and medications, using diabetes technolo- gies, engaging in physical activity, and making nutritional changes. Evidence supports using a variety of behavioral strategies and multicomponent inter- ventions to help people with diabetes and their caregivers or family members develop health behavior routines and overcome barriers to self-management behaviors (300\u2013302). Behavioral strate- gies with empirical support include moti- vational interviewing (303\u2013305), patient activation (306), goal setting and action planning (305,307\u2013309), problem-solving (308,310), tracking or self-monitoring health behaviors with or without feedback from a health care professional (305,307\u2013 309), and facilitating opportunities for so- cial support (305,308,309). Multicompo- nent intervention packages have the highest ef\ufb01cacy for behavioral and glyce- mic outcomes (300,309,311). For youth with diabetes, family-based behavioral intervention packages and multisystem interventions that facilitate health be- havior change demonstrate bene\ufb01t for increasing management behaviors and improving glycemic outcomes (301). Health behavior change strategies may be delivered by mental health professionals, DCES, or other trained health care profes- sionals (307,312\u2013314) or quali\ufb01ed com- munity health workers (307,308).

There are opportunities for diabetes health care professionals to routinely monitor and screen psychosocial status in a timely and ef\ufb01cient manner for referral to appropriate services (324,325). Various health care professionals working with people with diabetes may contrib- ute to psychosocial care in different ways based on training, experience, need, and availability (313,326,327). Ideally, quali- \ufb01ed mental health professionals with specialized training and experience in diabetes should be integrated with or provide collaborative care as part of dia- betes care teams (328\u2013331), or referrals for in-depth assessment and treatment for psychosocial concerns should be made to such mental health professionals when indicated (314,332,333). A system- atic review and meta-analysis showed that psychosocial interventions modestly but signi\ufb01cantly improved A1C (standard- ized mean difference \u20130.29%) and mental health outcomes (334). There was a lim- ited association between the effects on A1C and mental health, and no interven- tion characteristics predicted bene\ufb01t on both outcomes.

A list of age-appropriate screening and evaluation measures is provided in the ADA position statement \u201cPsychosocial Care for People with Dia- betes\u201d (1). Key opportunities for psychoso- cial screening occur at diabetes diagnosis, during regularly scheduled management visits, during hospitalizations, with new onset of complications, during signi\ufb01cant transitions in care such as from pediatric to adult care teams (341), at the time of medical treatment changes, or when problems with achieving A1C goals, quality of life, or self-management are identi\ufb01ed. People with diabetes are likely to exhibit psychological vulnerability at diagnosis, when their medical status changes (e.g., end of the honeymoon period), when the need for intensi\ufb01ed treatment is evident, and when complications are discovered. Signi\ufb01cant changes in life circumstances and SDOH are known to considerably af- fect a person\u2019s ability to self-manage their condition. Thus, screening for SDOH (e.g., loss of employment, birth of a child, or other family-based stresses) should also be incorporated into routine care (342). In circumstances where individuals other than the person with diabetes are signif- icantly involved in diabetes management (e.g., caregivers or family members), these issues should be monitored and treated by appropriate professionals (341,343,344).

Psychological Assessment and Treatment When psychosocial concerns are identi- \ufb01ed, referral to a quali\ufb01ed behavioral and/or mental health professional, ideally one specializing in diabetes, should be made for comprehensive evaluation, diag- nosis, and treatment (313,314,332,333). Indications for referral may include posi- tive screening for overall stress related to work-life balance, diabetes distress, diabe- tes management dif\ufb01culties, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and cognitive dysfunction (see Table 5.2 for a complete list). It is preferable to incorporate psycho- social assessment and treatment into rou- tine care rather than waiting for a speci\ufb01c problem or deterioration in metabolic or psychological status to occur (38,321).

The ADA provides a list of mental health professionals who have specialized exper- tise or who have received education about psychosocial and behavioral issues related to diabetes in the ADA Mental Health Professional Directory Listing (professional.diabetes.org/mhp_listing). Ideally, mental health professionals should be embedded in diabetes care settings. In recognition of limited behavioral health resources and to optimize availability, other health care professionals who have been trained in behavioral and mental health interventions may also provide this specialized psychosocial care (326,329,345,346). Although some health care professionals may not feel quali\ufb01ed to treat psychological problems (347), optimizing the relationship be- tween a person with diabetes and health care professional may increase the likeli- hood of the individual accepting referral for other services.

In the second Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs (DAWN2) study, signi\ufb01cant diabe- tes distress was reported by 45% of the participants, but only 24% reported that their health care teams asked them how diabetes affected their lives (321). Simi- lar rates have been identi\ufb01ed among adolescents with type 1 diabetes (360) and in parents of youth with type 1 diabetes. High levels of diabetes distress signi\ufb01cantly impact medication-taking behaviors and are linked to higher A1C, lower self-ef\ufb01cacy, and less optimal eat- ing and exercise behaviors (5,358,362).

A Anxiety symptoms and diagnosable disor- ders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, speci\ufb01c phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder) are common in people with diabetes (373). The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimated the lifetime preva- lence of generalized anxiety disorder to be 19.5% in people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (374). A common diabetes-speci\ufb01c concern is fears related to hypoglycemia (375,376), which may explain avoidance of behaviors associ- ated with lowering glucose, such as in- creasing insulin doses or frequency of monitoring. Other common sources of diabetes-related anxiety include not meet- ing blood glucose targets (373), insulin in- jections or infusion (377), and onset of complications (1). People with diabetes who exhibit excessive diabetes self-man- agement behaviors well beyond what is prescribed or needed to achieve glyce- mic targets may be experiencing symp- toms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (378).

If fear of hypoglycemia is identi\ufb01ed and a person does not have symptoms of hypoglycemia, a struc- tured program of blood glucose aware- ness training delivered in routine clinical practice can improve A1C, reduce the rate of severe hypoglycemia, and re- store hypoglycemia awareness (382,383). If not available within the practice set- ting, a structured program targeting both fear of hypoglycemia and un- awareness should be sought out and implemented by a quali\ufb01ed behavioral practitioner (381,383\u2013385). An RCT comparing blood glucose awareness training with a cognitively focused psy- choeducation program in adults with type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness of hypoglycemia that has been treat- ment resistant suggested that both ap- proaches were bene\ufb01cial for reducing hypoglycemia (386).

As with DSMES, person- centered collaborative care approaches have been shown to improve both de- pression and medical outcomes (392). Depressive symptoms may also be a man- ifestation of reduced quality of life sec- ondary to disease burden (also see DIABETES DISTRESS, above) and resultant changes in resource allocation impacting the person and their family. When depressive symp- toms are identi\ufb01ed, it is important to query origins, both diabetes-speci\ufb01c and due to other life circumstances (363,393). Trials have shown consistent evidence of improvements in depressive symptoms and variable bene\ufb01ts for A1C when depres- sion is simultaneously treated (331,392,394), whether through pharmacological treat- ment, group therapy, psychotherapy, or collaborative care (328,348,349,395,396). Psychological interventions targeting de- pressive symptoms have shown ef\ufb01cacy when delivered via digital technologies (397). Physical activity interventions also demonstrate bene\ufb01ts for depressive symp- toms and A1C (398). It is important to note that medical treatment plan should also be monitored in response to reduc- tion in depressive symptoms. People may agree to or adopt previously refused treatment strategies (improving ability to follow recommended treatment behav- iors), which may include increased physical activity and intensi\ufb01cation of treatment plan behaviors and monitoring, resulting in changed glucose pro\ufb01les.

B Estimated prevalence of disordered eat- ing behavior and diagnosable eating dis- orders in people with diabetes varies (399\u2013401). For people with type 1 dia- betes, insulin omission causing glycos- uria in order to lose weight is the most commonly reported disordered eating behavior (402,403); in people with type 2 diabetes, bingeing (excessive food in- take with an accompanying sense of loss of control) is most commonly re- ported. For people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, intentional omis- sion is also frequently reported (404). People with diabetes and diagnosable eating disorders have high rates of co- morbid psychiatric disorders (405). Peo- ple with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders have high rates of diabetes distress and fear of hypoglycemia (406). Diabetes care professionals should monitor for disordered eating behaviors using validated measures (407).",

Mixed intervention results point to the need for treatment of eating disorders and disordered eating behavior in the context of the disease and its treat- ment. Given the complexities of treating disordered eating behaviors and disrupted eating patterns in people with diabetes, it is recommended that multidisciplinary care teams include or collaborate with a health professional trained to identify and treat eating behaviors with expertise in disordered eating and diabetes (409). Key quali\ufb01cations for such professionals include familiarity with the diabetes dis- ease physiology, weight-related and psychological risk factors for disordered eating behaviors, and treatments for dia- betes and disordered eating behaviors.

Health care teams may consider the appropriateness of technol- ogy use among people with diabetes and disordered eating behaviors, although more research on the risks and bene\ufb01ts is needed (411). Caution should be taken in labeling individuals with diabetes as hav- ing a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, i.e., an eating disorder, when disordered or disrupted eating patterns are found to be associated with the disease and its treatment. In other words, patterns of maladaptive food intake that appear to have a psychological origin may be driven by physiologic disruption in hunger and sa- tiety cues, metabolic perturbations, and/ or secondary distress because of the indi- vidual\u2019s inability to control their hunger and satiety (401,408). The use of incretin therapies may have potential implications and rele- vance for the treatment of disrupted or disordered eating (see Section 8, \u201cObesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d). These medications promote substantial weight loss and mainte- nance of lost weight beyond conven- tional nutrition therapies (412), which may improve quality of life. Incretin therapies work in the appetite and re- ward circuitries to modulate food intake and energy balance, reducing uncontrolla- ble hunger, overeating, and bulimic symp- toms (413), although mechanisms are not completely understood. Health care professionals may see expanded use of these medications as data become available (401).

Serious Mental Illness Recommendations 5.50 Provide an increased level of support for people with diabe- tes and serious mental illness through enhanced monitoring of and assistance with diabetes self-management behaviors. B 5.51 In people who are prescribed atypical antipsychotic medica- tions, screen for prediabetes and diabetes 4 months after medication initiation and sooner if clinically indicated, at least annually. B 5.52 If a second-generation antipsy- chotic medication is prescribed for adolescents or adults with diabetes, changes in weight, glycemia, and cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored, and the treatment plan should be reassessed accordingly. C Studies of individuals with serious men- tal illness, particularly schizophrenia and other thought disorders, show signi\ufb01- cantly increased rates of type 2 diabetes (415). People with schizophrenia should be monitored for type 2 diabetes be- cause of the known comorbidity. Disor- dered thinking and judgment can be expected to make it dif\ufb01cult to engage in behavior that reduces risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as restrained eating for weight management. Further, people with serious mental health disorders and diabetes frequently experience moderate psychological distress, suggesting perva- sive intrusion of mental health issues into daily functioning (416). Coordinated management of diabe- tes or prediabetes and serious mental illness is recommended to achieve di- abetes treatment targets.

Such care may include remote monitoring, fa- cilitating health care aides, and providing diabetes training for family members, community support personnel, and other caregivers. Qualitative research suggests that educational and behavioral interven- tion may provide bene\ufb01t via group sup- port, accountability, and assistance with applying diabetes knowledge (417). In ad- dition, those taking second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, such as olanza- pine, require greater monitoring because of an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes as- sociated with this medication (418\u2013420). Because of this increased risk, people should be screened for prediabetes or di- abetes 4 months after medication initia- tion and at least annually thereafter. Serious mental illness is often associated with the inability to evaluate and utilize information to make judgments about treatment options. When a person has an established diagnosis of a mental ill- ness that impacts judgment, activities of daily living, and ability to establish a col- laborative relationship with care profes- sionals, it is wise to include a nonmedical caretaker in decision-making regarding the medical treatment plan. This person can help improve the patient\u2019s ability to follow the agreed-upon treatment plan through both monitoring and caretaking functions (421).

B 5.54 If cognitive capacity changes or appears to be suboptimal for patient decision-making and/or behavioral self-management, re- ferral for a formal assessment should be considered. E Cognitive capacity is generally de\ufb01ned as attention, memory, logic and reasoning, and auditory and visual processing, all of which are involved in diabetes self- management behavior (422). Having di- abetes over decades\u2014type 1 and type 2\u2014 has been shown to be associated with cog- nitive decline (423\u2013425). Declines have been shown to impact executive function and information processing speed; they are not consistent between people, and evi- dence is lacking regarding a known course of decline (426). Diagnosis of dementia is also more prevalent among people with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 (427). Thus, monitoring of cognitive capacity of individuals is recommended, particularly regarding their ability to self-monitor and make judgments about their symp- toms, physical status, and needed altera- tions to their self-management behaviors, all of which are mediated by executive function (427).

Youth will need second-party monitoring (e.g., parents and adult care- givers) until they are developmentally able to evaluate necessary information for self-management decisions and to in- form resultant behavior changes. Episodes of severe hypoglycemia are independently associated with decline, as well as the more immediate symp- toms of mental confusion (428). Early- onset type 1 diabetes has been shown to be associated with potential de\ufb01cits in intellectual abilities, especially in the context of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (429). (See Section 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d for infor- mation on early-onset diabetes and cog- nitive abilities and the effects of severe hypoglycemia on children\u2019s cognitive and academic performance.) Thus, for myriad reasons, cognitive capacity should be as- sessed during routine care to ascertain the person\u2019s ability to maintain and ad- just self-management behaviors, such as dosing of medications, remediation ap- proaches to glycemic excursions, etc., and to determine whether to enlist a caregiver in monitoring and decision-making regard- ing management behaviors. If cognitive capacity to carry out self-maintenance be- haviors is questioned, an age-appropriate test of cognitive capacity is recommended (1). Cognitive capacity should be evalu- ated in the context of the person\u2019s age, for example, in very young children who are not expected to manage their disease independently and in older adults who may need active monitoring of treatment plan behaviors.

B The associations between sleep prob- lems and diabetes are complex: sleep disorders are a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes (430,431) and possibly gestational diabetes mellitus (432,433). Moreover, sleep disturbances are asso- ciated with less engagement in diabetes self-management and may interfere with the achievement of glycemic tar- gets among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (434\u2013439). Disrupted sleep and sleep disorders, including ob- structive sleep apnea (440), insomnia, and sleep disturbances (435), are com- mon among people with diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, estimates of poor sleep range from 30% to 50% (441), and esti- mates of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea are >50% (436). In type 2 diabetes, 24\u201386% of people are esti- mated to have obstructive sleep apnea (442), 39% to have insomnia, and 8\u201345% to have restless leg syndrome (439). Risk of hypoglycemia poses speci\ufb01c challenges for sleep in people with type 1 diabetes and may require targeted assessment and treatment approaches (443). People with diabetes and their family members also describe diabetes management needs interfering with sleep and experiencing worries about poor sleep; technology has been described as both a help and chal- lenge in relation to sleep (444).

ASSESSMENT OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL Glycemic control is assessed by the A1C measurement, continuous glucose moni- toring (CGM) using time in range (TIR) and/or glucose management indicator (GMI), and blood glucose monitoring (BGM). A1C is the metric used to date in clini- cal trials demonstrating the bene\ufb01ts of improved glycemic control. Individual glu- cose monitoring",

CGM serves an in- creasingly important role in the management of the effectiveness and safety of treatment in many people with type 1 diabetes and in selected people with type 2 diabetes. Individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can bene\ufb01t from CGM with improved glucose control, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self-ef\ufb01cacy (Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d) (1). Glycemic Assessment Recommendations 6.1 Assess glycemic status (A1C or other glycemic measurement such as time in range or glucose management indicator) at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control). E 6.2 Assess glycemic status at least quarterly and as needed in patients whose therapy has recently changed and/or who are not meeting glycemic goals.

Thus, A1C testing should be performed routinely in all people with diabetes at initial assessment and as part of continu- ing care. Measurement approximately every 3 months determines whether pa- tients\u2019 glycemic targets have been reached and maintained. A 14-day CGM assess- ment of TIR and GMI can serve as a surrogate for A1C for use in clinical management (5\u20139). The frequency of A1C testing should depend on the clin- ical situation, the treatment plan, and the clinician\u2019s judgment. The use of point-of-care A1C testing or CGM- derived TIR and GMI may provide an opportunity for more timely treatment changes during encounters between pa- tients and health care professionals. People with type 2 diabetes with stable glycemia well within target may do well with A1C testing or other glucose as- sessment only twice per year. Unstable or intensively managed patients or people not at goal with treatment adjustments may require testing more frequently (every 3 months with interim assessments as needed for safety) (10). CGM parameters can be tracked in the clinic or via tele- health to optimize diabetes management. A1C Limitations The A1C test is an indirect measure of av- erage glycemia and, as such, is subject to limitations. As with any laboratory test, there is variability in the measurement of A1C. Although A1C variability is lower on an intraindividual basis than that of blood",

For exam- ple, conditions that affect red blood cell turnover (hemolytic and other anemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01- ciency, recent blood transfusion, use of drugs that stimulate erythropoiesis, end- stage kidney disease, and pregnancy) may result in discrepancies between the A1C result and the patient\u2019s true mean glycemia (11). Hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient\u2019s CGM or BGM levels. However, most assays in use in the U.S. are accu- rate in individuals who are heterozygous for the most common variants (ngsp. org/interf.asp). Other measures of aver- age glycemia such as fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol are available, but their translation into average glucose levels and their prognostic signi\ufb01cance are not as clear as for A1C and CGM. Though some variability in the relation- ship between average glucose levels and A1C exists among different individ- uals, in general the association between mean glucose and A1C within an indi- vidual correlates over time (12). A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability, es- pecially people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with severe insulin de\ufb01- ciency, glycemic control is best evaluated by the combination of results from BGM/ CGM and A1C.

Correlation Between BGM and A1C Table 6.1 shows the correlation between A1C levels and mean glucose levels based on the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study, which assessed the correlation between A1C and fre- quent BGM and CGM in 507 adults (83% non-Hispanic White) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes (13), and an empirical study of the average blood glucose levels at premeal, postmeal, and bedtime asso- ciated with speci\ufb01ed A1C levels using data from the ADAG trial (14). The Amer- ican Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association for Clinical Chemis- try have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) in the ADAG trial is strong enough to justify reporting both the A1C result and the estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. Clinicians should note that the mean plasma glucose numbers in Table 6.1 are based on \u00012,700 readings per A1C measurement in the ADAG trial. In a report, mean glucose measured with CGM versus central laboratory\u2013measured A1C in 387 participants in three random- ized trials demonstrated that A1C may underestimate or overestimate mean glu- cose in individuals (12).

Other studies have also demonstrated higher A1C levels in African American participants than in White participants at a given mean glu- cose concentration (15,16). In contrast, a recent report in Afro-Caribbean individu- als found lower A1C relative to glucose values (17). Taken together, A1C and glu- cose parameters are essential for the op- timal assessment of glycemic status. A1C assays are available that do not demonstrate a statistically signi\ufb01cant dif- ference in individuals with hemoglobin variants.

Another genetic variant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate de- hydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of African American individuals, was associ- ated with a decrease in A1C of about 0.8% in hemizygous men and 0.7% in homozygous women compared with those without the trait (20). A small study comparing A1C to CGM data in children with type 1 diabetes found a highly statistically signi\ufb01cant cor- relation between A1C and mean blood glucose, although the correlation (r = 0.7) was signi\ufb01cantly lower than that in the ADAG trial (21). Whether there are clinically meaningful differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in chil- dren or in different ethnicities is an area for further study (15,22,23). Until further evidence is available, it seems prudent to establish A1C goals in these popula- tions with consideration of individualized CGM, BGM, and A1C results. Limitations in perfect alignment between glycemic measurements do not interfere with the usefulness of BGM/CGM for insulin dose adjustments.

As stated in the recommenda- tions, time in range (TIR) is a useful metric of glycemic control and glucose patterns, and it correlates well with A1C in most studies (24\u201329). New data sup- port the premise that increased TIR cor- relates with the risk of complications. The studies supporting this assertion are reviewed in more detail in Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d; they include cross- sectional data and cohort studies (30\u201332) demonstrating TIR as an acceptable end point for clinical trials moving forward and that it can be used for assessment of glycemic control. Additionally, time be- low range (<70 and <54 mg/dL [3.9 and 3.0 mmol/L]) and time above range (>180 mg/dL [10.0 mmol/L]) are useful parameters for insulin dose adjustments and reevaluation of the treatment plan. For many people with diabetes, glu- cose monitoring is key for achieving glycemic targets. Major clinical trials of in- sulin-treated patients have included BGM as part of multifactorial interventions to demonstrate the bene\ufb01t of intensive gly- cemic control on diabetes complications (33). BGM is thus an integral component of effective therapy of patients taking in- sulin.

The international consensus on TIR provides guidance on standardized CGM metrics (Table 6.2) and considera- tions for clinical interpretation and care (35). To make these metrics more action- able, standardized reports with visual cues, such as the ambulatory glucose pro- \ufb01le (Fig 6.1), are recommended (35) and may help the patient and the health care professional better interpret the data to guide treatment decisions (24,27). BGM and CGM can be useful to guide medical nutrition therapy and physical activity, prevent hypoglycemia, and aid medication management. While A1C is currently the primary measure to guide glucose man- agement and a valuable risk marker for developing diabetes complications, the CGM metrics TIR (with time below range and time above range) and GMI provide the insights for a more personalized dia- betes management plan. The incorpora- tion of these metrics into clinical practice is in evolution, and remote access to these data can be critical for telehealth. A rapid optimization and harmonization of CGM terminology and remote access is occurring to meet patient and health care professional needs (36\u201338). The patient\u2019s speci\ufb01c needs and goals should dictate BGM frequency and timing and con- sideration of CGM use.

E A1C and Microvascular Complications Hyperglycemia de\ufb01nes diabetes, and gly- cemic control is fundamental to diabetes management. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (33), a prospec- tive randomized controlled trial of inten- sive (mean A1C about 7% [53 mmol/mol]) versus standard (mean A1C about 9% [75 mmol/mol]) glycemic control in peo- ple with type 1 diabetes, showed de\ufb01ni- tively that better glycemic control is associated with 50\u201376% reductions in rates of development and progression of microvascular (retinopathy, neurop- athy, and diabetic kidney disease) com- plications. Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Inter- ventions and Complications (EDIC) study (42,43) demonstrated persistence of these microvascular bene\ufb01ts over two decades despite the fact that the glycemic separation between the treat- ment groups diminished and disap- peared during follow-up. The Kumamoto Study (44) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (45,46) con\ufb01rmed that intensive gly- cemic control signi\ufb01cantly decreased rates of microvascular complications in people with short-duration type 2 diabetes. Long-term follow-up of the UKPDS cohorts showed enduring ef- fects of early glycemic control on most microvascular complications (47). Therefore, achieving A1C targets of <7% (53 mmol/mol) has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes when in- stituted early in the course of disease (2,48). Findings from the DCCT (33) and UKPDS (49) studies demonstrate a curvi- linear relationship between A1C and mi- crovascular complications. Such analyses suggest that, on a population",

These analyses also suggest that further lower- ing of A1C from 7 to 6% (53 mmol/mol to 42 mmol/mol) is associated with further reduction in the risk of micro- vascular complications, although the absolute risk reductions become much smaller. The implication of these \ufb01ndings is that there is no need to deintensify therapy for an individual with an A1C between 6 and 7% in the setting of low hypoglycemia risk with a long life expectancy. There are now newer agents that do not cause hypoglycemia, making it possible to maintain glucose control without the risk of hypoglycemia (see Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\u201d). Given the substantially increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes and with polypharmacy in type 2 diabetes, the risks of lower glycemic targets may outweigh the potential bene\ufb01ts on microvascular complications. Three landmark trials (Ac- tion to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Dia- betes [ACCORD], Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE], and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial [VADT]) were conducted to test the effects of near normalization of blood glucose on cardiovascular outcomes in individ- uals with long-standing type 2 diabe- tes and either known cardiovascular disease (CVD) or high cardiovascular diabetesjournals.org/care Glycemic Targets S101 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Randomized clinical trials examining these agents for cardiovas- cular safety were not designed to test higher versus lower A1C; therefore, beyond post hoc analysis of these tri- als, we do not have evidence that it is the glucose lowering by these agents that confers the CVD and renal bene\ufb01t (53).

In the DCCT, there was a trend toward lower risk of CVD events with intensive control.

In addition, data from the Swedish National Diabe- tes Registry (56) and the Joint Asia Dia- betes Evaluation (JADE) demonstrate greater proportions of people with dia- betes being diagnosed at <40 years of age and a demonstrably increased bur- den of heart disease and years of life lost in people diagnosed at a younger age (57\u201360).

Individuals with a long duration of diabetes, a known history of hypoglycemia, advanced ath- erosclerosis, or advanced age/frailty may bene\ufb01t from less aggressive targets (67,68). As discussed further below, severe hypoglycemia is a potent marker of high absolute risk of cardiovascular events and mortality (69).

Thus, a goal that might be appropriate for an individual early in the course of their diabetes may change over time. Newly diagnosed pa- tients and/or those without comorbidities that limit life expectancy may bene\ufb01t from intensive control proven to prevent microvascular complications. Both DCCT/ EDIC and UKPDS demonstrated metabolic memory, or a legacy effect, in which a \ufb01- nite period of intensive control yielded bene\ufb01ts that extended for decades after that control ended. Thus, a \ufb01nite period of intensive control to near-normal A1C may yield enduring bene\ufb01ts even if con- trol is subsequently deintensi\ufb01ed as pa- tient characteristics change. Over time, comorbidities may emerge, decreasing life expectancy and thereby decreasing the potential to reap bene\ufb01ts from intensive control. Also, with longer disease dura- tion, diabetes may become more dif\ufb01- cult to control, with increasing risks and burdens of therapy.

In people with diabetes, surro- gate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hy- perglycemia. It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyper- glycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being greater at A1C levels that are closer to 7% (53 mmol/mol). However, outcome studies have shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complica- tions, and landmark trials of glycemic control such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly on preprandial BGM. Additionally, a randomized con- trolled trial in patients with known CVD found no CVD bene\ufb01t of insulin treat- ment plans targeting postprandial glu- cose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose (73). Therefore, it is reasonable to check postprandial glu- cose in individuals who have premeal glucose values within target but A1C values above target. In addition, when intensifying insulin therapy, measuring postprandial plasma glucose 1\u20132 h af- ter the start of a meal (using BGM or CGM) and using treatments aimed at reducing postprandial plasma glucose values to <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) may help to lower A1C.

A blood glucose concentra- tion of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) has been recognized as a threshold for neuroendo- crine responses to falling glucose in peo- ple without diabetes. Because many people with diabetes demonstrate im- paired counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia and/or experience hypo- glycemia unawareness, a measured glu- cose level <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is considered clinically important (indepen- dent of the severity of acute hypoglyce- mic symptoms). Level 2 hypoglycemia (de\ufb01ned as a blood glucose concentration <54 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]) is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms be- gin to occur and requires immediate ac- tion to resolve the hypoglycemic event.

Level 3 hypoglycemia was associated with mortality in participants in both the standard and the intensive glyce- mia arms of the ACCORD trial, but the relationships between hypoglycemia, achieved A1C, and treatment intensity were not straightforward. An associa- tion of level 3 hypoglycemia with mor- tality was also found in the ADVANCE trial (90).

Glucose variability is also associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemia (92). Young children with type 1 diabetes and the elderly, including those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (84,93), are noted as particularly vulnerable to hy- poglycemia because of their reduced ability to recognize hypoglycemic symp- toms and effectively communicate their needs.

An additional goal of raising the lower range of the glycemic target was to limit overtreatment and provide a safety margin in patients titrating glucose- lowering drugs such as insulin to gly- cemic targets. Hypoglycemia Treatment Health care professionals should con- tinue to counsel patients to treat hypo- glycemia with fast-acting carbohydrates at the hypoglycemia alert value of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or less. This should be reviewed at each patient visit. Hypoglycemia treatment requires ingestion of glucose- or carbohydrate- containing foods (98\u2013100).

BGM and, for some individuals, CGM are essential tools to assess therapy and detect incipient hypoglycemia. Peo- ple with diabetes should understand sit- uations that increase their risk of hypoglycemia, such as when fasting for laboratory tests or procedures, when meals are delayed, during and after the consumption of alcohol, during and af- ter intense physical activity, and during sleep. Hypoglycemia may increase the risk of harm to self or others, such as when driving. Teaching people with dia- betes to balance insulin use and carbo- hydrate intake and physical activity are necessary, but these strategies are not always suf\ufb01cient for prevention (77, 103\u2013105). Formal training programs to increase awareness of hypoglycemia and to develop strategies to decrease hypoglycemia have been developed, in- cluding the Blood Glucose Awareness Training Program, Dose Adjusted for Normal Eating (DAFNE), and DAFNE- plus. Conversely, some individuals with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia who have a fear of hyper- glycemia are resistant to relaxation of glycemic targets (74\u201383). Regardless of the factors contributing to hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness, this rep- resents an urgent",

    "text": "medical issue requiring intervention. In type 1 diabetes and severely insulin- de\ufb01cient type 2 diabetes, hypoglycemia unawareness (or hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure) can severely compro- mise stringent diabetes control and qual- ity of life. This syndrome is characterized by de\ufb01cient counterregulatory hormone release, especially in older adults, and a diminished autonomic response, which are both risk factors for and caused by hypoglycemia. A corollary to this \u201cvicious cycle\u201d is that several weeks of avoidance of hypoglycemia has been demonstrated to improve counterregulation and hypo- glycemia awareness in many people with diabetes (106). Hence, individuals with one or more episodes of clinically signi\ufb01- cant hypoglycemia may bene\ufb01t from at least short-term relaxation of glycemic targets and availability of glucagon (107). Any person with recurrent hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness should have their glucose management treat- ment plan adjusted. Use of CGM Technology in Hypoglycemia Prevention With the advent of sensor-augmented CGM and CGM-assisted pump therapy, there has been a promise of alarm-based prevention of hypoglycemia (108,109). To date, there have been a number of ran- domized controlled trials in adults with type 1 diabetes and studies in adults and children with type 1 diabetes using real- time CGM (see Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d). These studies had differ- ing A1C at entry and differing primary end points and thus must be inter- preted carefully. Real-time CGM studies can be divided into studies with ele- vated A1C with the primary end point of A1C reduction and studies with A1C near target with the primary end",

    "text": "point of reduction in hypoglycemia (98, 109\u2013124). In people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with A1C above target, CGM improved A1C between 0.3 and 0.6%. For studies targeting hypoglyce- mia, most studies demonstrated a signi\ufb01- cant reduction in time spent between 54 and 70 mg/dL. A report in people with type 1 diabetes over the age of 60 years revealed a small but statistically signi\ufb01- cant decrease in hypoglycemia (125). No study to date has reported a decrease in level 3 hypoglycemia. In a single study using intermittently scanned CGM, adults with type 1 diabetes with A1C near goal and impaired awareness of hypoglycemia demonstrated no change in A1C and decreased level 2 hypoglycemia (115). For people with type 2 diabetes, studies examining the impact of CGM on hy- poglycemic events are limited; a re- cent meta-analysis does not re\ufb02ect a signi\ufb01cant impact on hypoglycemic events in type 2 diabetes (126), whereas im- provements in A1C were observed in most studies (126\u2013132). Overall, real- time CGM appears to be a useful tool for decreasing time spent in a hypo- glycemic range in people with impaired awareness. For people with type 2 diabe- tes, other strategies to assist them with insulin dosing can improve A1C with minimal hypoglycemia (133,134).

Any condition leading to deterioration in glycemic control necessi- tates more frequent monitoring of blood glucose; ketosis-prone patients also re- quire urine or blood ketone monitoring. If accompanied by ketosis, vomiting, or al- teration in the level of consciousness, marked hyperglycemia requires tempo- rary adjustment of the treatment plan and immediate interaction with the dia- betes care team. The patient treated with noninsulin therapies or medical nutrition therapy alone may require insulin. Ade- quate \ufb02uid and caloric intake must be ensured. Infection or dehydration are more likely to necessitate hospitaliza- tion of individuals with diabetes versus those without diabetes. A clinician with expertise in diabetes management should treat the hospital- ized patient.

Diabetes technology is the term used to describe the hardware, devices, and soft- ware that people with diabetes use to assist with self-management, ranging from lifestyle modi\ufb01cations to glucose monitoring and therapy adjustments. Historically, diabetes technology has been divided into two main categories: insulin adminis- tered by syringe, pen, or pump (also called continuous",

Diabetes technology has expanded to include automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, where CGM-informed algorithms modulate insulin de- livery, as well as diabetes self-management support software serving as medical devi- ces. Diabetes technology, when coupled with education, follow-up, and support, can improve the lives and health of people with diabetes; however, the complexity and rapid evolution of the diabetes technology landscape can also be a barrier to imple- mentation for both people with diabetes and the health care team. GENERAL DEVICE PRINCIPLES Recommendations 7.1 The type(s) and selection of devices should be individualized based on a person\u2019s speci\ufb01c needs, preferences, and skill level. In the setting of an individual whose diabetes is partially or wholly managed by someone else (e.g., a young child or a person with cognitive impairment or dexterity, psy- chosocial, and/or physical limitations), the caregiver\u2019s skills and preferences are integral to the decision-making process. E 7.2 When prescribing a device, ensure that people with diabetes/caregivers receive initial and ongoing education and training, either in-person or remotely, and ongoing evaluation of technique, results, and their ability to utilize data, including uploading/sharing data (if applicable), to moni- tor and adjust therapy.

E 7.4 Students should be supported at school in the use of diabetes technology, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems, continuous subcutaneous in- sulin infusion, connected insu- lin pens, and automated insulin delivery systems, as prescribed by their health care team. E 7.5 Initiation of continuous glucose monitoring, continuous subcu- taneous insulin infusion, and/or automated insulin delivery early in the treatment of diabetes can be bene\ufb01cial depending on a person\u2019s/caregiver\u2019s needs and preferences.

Those with more edu- cation regarding device use have better outcomes (1,2); therefore, the need for additional education should be periodically assessed, particularly if outcomes are not being met. Use in Schools Instructions for device use should be outlined in the student\u2019s diabetes medi- cal management plan (DMMP). A backup plan should be included in the DMMP for potential device failure (e.g., BGM, CGM, and/or insulin delivery devices). School nurses and designees should complete training to stay up to date on diabetes technologies prescribed for use in the school setting. Updated resources to support diabetes care at school, in- cluding training materials and a DMMP template, can be found online at diabetes. org/safeatschool. Initiation of Device Use The use of CGM devices should be con- sidered from the outset of the diagnosis of diabetes that requires insulin manage- ment (3,4). This allows for close tracking of glucose levels with adjustments of insulin dosing and lifestyle modi\ufb01cations and removes the burden of frequent BGM. In addition, early CGM initiation after diag- nosis of type 1 diabetes in youth has been shown to decrease A1C and is associated with high parental satisfaction and reliance on this technology for diabetes manage- ment (5,6). In appropriate individuals, early use of AID systems or insulin pumps may be considered. Interruption of access to CGM is associated with a worsening of outcomes (7,8); therefore, it is important for individuals on CGM to have consis-",

BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING Recommendations 7.6 People with diabetes should be provided with blood glucose monitoring devices as indicated by their circumstances, prefer- ences, and treatment. People using continuous glucose moni- toring devices must also have access to blood glucose moni- toring at all times. A 7.7 People who are on insulin using blood glucose monitor- ing should be encouraged to check their blood glucose lev- els when appropriate based on their insulin therapy. This may include checking when fasting, prior to meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, prior to exercise, when hypo- glycemia is suspected, after treating low blood glucose levels until they are normo- glycemic, when hyperglycemia is suspected, and prior to and while performing critical tasks such as driving.

E Major clinical trials of insulin-treated peo- ple with diabetes have included BGM as part of multifactorial interventions to dem- onstrate the bene\ufb01t of intensive glycemic management on diabetes complications (9). BGM is thus an integral component of effective therapy of individuals taking insulin. In recent years, CGM has emerged as a method for the assessment of glucose lev- els (discussed below). Glucose monitoring allows people with diabetes to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glycemic targets are being safely achieved. Integrating results into diabetes management can be a useful tool for guiding medical nutrition therapy and physical activity, preventing hypoglyce- mia, or adjusting medications (particularly S112 Diabetes Technology Diabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

As rec- ommended by the device manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA), people with diabetes using CGM must have access to BGM for mul- tiple reasons, including whenever there is suspicion that the CGM is inaccurate, while waiting for warm-up, for calibration (some sensors) or if a warning mes- sage appears, and in any clinical set- ting where glucose levels are changing rapidly (>2 mg/dL/min), which could cause a discrepancy between CGM and blood glucose. Meter Standards Glucose meters meeting FDA guidance for meter accuracy provide the most re- liable data for diabetes management. There are several current standards for the accuracy of blood glucose meters, but the two most used are those of the International Organization for Standardi- zation (ISO) (ISO 15197:2013) and the FDA. The current ISO and FDA standards are compared in Table 7.1. In Europe, currently marketed meters must meet current ISO standards. In the U.S., cur- rently marketed meters must meet the standard under which they were ap- proved, which may not be the current standard. Moreover, the monitoring of current accuracy post-marketing is left to the manufacturer and not routinely checked by an independent source.

The Diabetes Technology Soci- ety Blood Glucose Monitoring System Surveillance Program provides information on the performance of devices used for BGM (diabetestechnology.org/surveillance/). In one analysis, 6 of the top 18 glucose meters met the accuracy standard (12). In a subsequent analysis with updated glucose meters, 14 of 18 glucose meters met the minimum accuracy requirements (13). There are single-meter studies in which bene\ufb01ts have been found with individual meter systems, but few studies have compared meters head-to-head. Certain meter system characteristics, such as the use of lancing devices that are less painful (14) and the ability to reapply blood to a strip with an insuf\ufb01cient initial sample, may also be bene\ufb01cial to people with diabetes (15) and may make BGM less burdensome to perform. Counterfeit Strips People with diabetes should be advised against purchasing or reselling preowned or secondhand test strips, as these may give incorrect results. Only unopened and unexpired vials of glucose test strips should be used to ensure BGM accuracy. Optimizing Blood Glucose Monitoring Device Use Optimal use of BGM devices requires proper review and interpretation of data by both the person with diabetes and the health care professional to ensure that data are used in an effective and timely manner. In people with type 1 diabetes, there is a correlation between greater BGM frequency and lower A1C (16). Among those who check their blood glucose at least once daily, many report taking no action when results are high or low (17). Some",

The ongoing need for and frequency of BGM should be reevaluated at each routine visit to ensure its effec- tive use (17,20,21). People With Diabetes on Intensive Insulin Therapies BGM is especially important for people with diabetes treated with insulin to monitor for and prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Most individuals on intensive insulin therapies (multiple daily injections [MDI] or insulin pump therapy) should be encouraged to assess glucose levels using BGM (and/or CGM) prior to meals and snacks, at bedtime, occasion- ally postprandially, prior to physical activ- ity, when they suspect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, after treating hypoglyce- mia until they are normoglycemic, and prior to and while performing critical tasks such as driving. For many individu- als using BGM, this requires checking up to 6\u201310 times daily, although individual needs may vary. A database study of almost 27,000 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes showed that, after adjusting for multiple confounders, in- creased daily frequency of BGM was signi\ufb01cantly associated with lower A1C (\u00010.2% per additional check per day) and with fewer acute complications (22).

However, for those taking basal insulin, assessing fasting glu- cose with BGM to inform dose adjust- ments to achieve blood glucose targets results in lower A1C (23,24). In people with type 2 diabetes not taking insulin, routine glucose monitor- ing may be of limited additional clinical bene\ufb01t. By itself, even when combined with education, it has shown limited im- provement in outcomes (25\u201328). However, for some individuals, glucose monitoring can provide insight into the impact of nutrition, physical activity, and medication management on glucose levels. Glucose monitoring may also be useful in assess- ing hypoglycemia, glucose levels during intercurrent illness, or discrepancies be- tween measured A1C and glucose levels when there is concern an A1C result may not be reliable in speci\ufb01c individuals. It may be useful when coupled with a treat- ment adjustment program. In a year-long study of insulin-naive people with diabetes with suboptimal initial glycemic outcomes, a group trained in structured BGM (a paper tool was used at least quarterly to collect and interpret seven-point BGM pro\ufb01les taken on 3 consecutive days) re- duced their A1C by 0.3% more than the control group (29).

A key consideration is that perform- ing BGM alone does not lower blood glu- cose levels. To be useful, the information must be integrated into clinical and self- management plans. Glucose Meter Inaccuracy Although many meters function well under various circumstances, health care profes- sionals and people with diabetes must be aware of factors impairing meter accuracy. A meter reading that seems discordant with the clinical picture needs to be re- tested or tested in a laboratory. Health care professionals in intensive care unit settings need to be particularly aware of the potential for abnormal meter readings during critical illness, and laboratory-based values should be used if there is any doubt. Some meters give error messages if meter readings are likely to be false (33). Oxygen. Currently available glucose mon- itors utilize an enzymatic reaction linked to an electrochemical reaction, either glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase (34). Glucose oxidase monitors are sensi- tive to the oxygen available and should only be used with capillary blood in people with normal oxygen saturation. Higher oxy- gen tensions (i.e., arterial blood or oxygen therapy) may result in false low glucose readings, and low oxygen tensions (i.e., high altitude, hypoxia, or venous blood readings) may lead to false high glucose readings.

The types of sensors currently available are either disposable (rtCGM and isCGM) or implantable (rtCGM). Table 7.3 pro- vides the de\ufb01nitions for the types of CGM devices. For people with type 1 di- abetes using CGM, frequency of sensor use was an important predictor of A1C lowering for all age-groups (35,36). The frequency of scanning with isCGM devi- ces was also correlated with improved outcomes (37\u201340). Some real-time systems require cali- bration by the user, which varies in frequency depending on the device. Ad- ditionally, some CGM systems are called \u201cadjunctive,\u201d meaning the user should perform BGM for making treatment deci- sions such as dosing insulin or treating hypoglycemia. Devices that do not have this requirement outside of certain clinical situations (see BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING above) are called \u201cnonadjunctive\u201d (41\u201343).

The initial studies were primarily done in adults and youth with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy and/or MDI (35,36,45\u201348,51\u201361). The pri- mary outcome was met and showed ben- e\ufb01t in adults of all ages (35,45,46,51,52,54, 56,57,68\u201371) including seniors (53,72,73). Data in children are less consistent; how- ever, rtCGM in young children with type 1 diabetes reduced hypoglycemia; in addi- tion, behavioral support in parents of young children with diabetes using rtCGM showed the bene\ufb01ts of reducing hypoglycemia concerns and diabetes dis- tress (35,60,74). Similarly, A1C reduction was seen in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes using rtCGM (59). RCT data on rtCGM use in individu- als with type 2 diabetes on MDI (63), mixed therapies (64,65), and basal in- sulin (66,75) have consistently shown reductions in A1C but not a reduction in rates of hypoglycemia. The improve- ments in type 2 diabetes have largely occurred without changes in insulin doses or other diabetes medications. CGM dis- continuation in individuals with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin caused partial reversal of A1C reduction and time in range (TIR) improvements, suggesting that continued CGM use achieves the greatest bene\ufb01ts (8).

Some retro- spective/observational data have shown an improvement in A1C levels for adults with type 2 diabetes on MDI (86), basal insulin (87), and basal insulin or noninsulin therapies (88). In a retrospective study of adults with type 2 diabetes taking insulin, a reduction in acute diabetes-related events and all-cause hospitalizations was seen (89). Results of self-reported outcomes varied, but where measured, people with diabetes had an increase in treatment satisfaction when comparing isCGM with BGM.

Data Analysis The abundance of data provided by CGM offers opportunities to analyze data for people with diabetes more granularly than previously possible, providing addi- tional information to aid in achieving glycemic targets. A variety of metrics have been proposed (95) and are discussed in Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets.\u201d CGM is es- sential for creating an ambulatory glucose pro\ufb01le and providing data on TIR, percent- age of time spent above and below range, and glycemic variability (96).

This study demonstrated the value of rtCGM in pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabe- tes by showing a mild improvement in A1C without an increase in hypoglycemia and reductions in large-for-gestational-age births, length of stay, and neonatal hypo- glycemia (97).

Use of the rtCGM-reported mean glucose is superior to use of glu- cose management indicator (GMI) and other calculations to estimate A1C given the changes to A1C that occur in preg- nancy (99). Two studies employing in- termittent use of rtCGM showed no difference in neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes (100) or gestational diabetes mellitus (101). Use of Professional and Intermittent Continuous Glucose Monitoring Professional CGM devices, which provide retrospective data, either blinded or unblinded, for analysis, can be used to identify patterns of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia (102,103). Professional CGM can be helpful to evaluate individuals when either rtCGM or isCGM is not available to the individual or they prefer a blinded analysis or a shorter experience with un- blinded data. It can be particularly use- ful to evaluate periods of hypoglycemia in individuals on agents that can cause hypoglycemia in order to make medica- tion dose adjustments. It can also be useful to evaluate individuals for peri- ods of hyperglycemia. Some data have shown the bene\ufb01t of intermittent use of CGM (rtCGM or isCGM) in individuals with type 2 diabetes on noninsulin and/or basal insulin thera- pies (64,104).

Identifying and eliminating tape allergens is important to ensure the comfortable use of devices and promote self-care (115\u2013118). In some instances, using an implanted sensor can help avoid skin reac- tions in those sensitive to tape (119,120). Substances and Factors Affecting Continuous Glucose Monitoring Accuracy Sensor interference due to several medi- cations/substances is a known potential source of CGM measurement errors (Table 7.4). While several of these sub- stances have been reported in the various CGM brands\u2019 user manuals, additional interferences have been discovered after the market release of these products. Hy- droxyurea, used for myeloproliferative dis- orders and hematologic conditions, is one of the most recently identi\ufb01ed interfer- ing substances that cause a temporary increase in sensor glucose values discrepant from actual glucose values (121\u2013126). Therefore, it is crucial to routinely review the medication list of the person with di- abetes to identify possible interfering substances and advise them accordingly on the need to use additional BGM if sen- sor values are unreliable due to these substances.

For people with dia- betes who use insulin, insulin syringes and pens are both able to deliver insulin safely and effectively for the achievement of glycemic targets. Individual preferences, cost, insulin type, dosing therapy, and self-management capabilities should be considered when choosing among delivery systems. Trials with insulin pens generally show equivalence or small improvements in glycemic outcomes compared with us- ing a vial and syringe. Many individuals with diabetes prefer using a pen due to its simplicity and convenience. It is important to note that while many insulin types are available for purchase as either pens or vials, others may be available in only one form or the other, and there may be signif- icant cost differences between pens and vials (see Table 9.4 for a list of insulin product costs",

Insulin pens offer added convenience by combining the vial and syringe into a single device. Insulin pens, allowing push- button injections, come as disposable pens with pre\ufb01lled cartridges or reusable insulin pens with replaceable insulin car- tridges. Pens vary with respect to dosing increment and minimal dose, ranging from half-unit doses to 2-unit dose in- crements. U-500 pens come in 5-unit dose increments. Some reusable pens include a memory function, which can recall dose amounts and timing. Con- nected insulin pens are insulin pens with the capacity to record and/or transmit in- sulin dose data. Insulin pen caps are also available and are placed on existing insulin Table 7.4\u2014Continuous",

These pens and pen caps are useful to people with diabetes for real-time insulin dosing and allow clini- cians to retrospectively review the insu- lin delivery times and in some cases doses and glucose data in order to make informed insulin dose adjustments (148). Needle thickness (gauge) and length are other considerations. Needle gauges range from 22 to 34, with a higher gauge indicating a thinner needle. A thicker needle can give a dose of insulin more quickly, while a thinner needle may cause less pain. Needle length ranges from 4 to 12.7 mm, with some evidence suggesting shorter needles (4\u20135 mm) lower the risk of intramuscular injection and possibly the development of lipohypertrophy. When reused, needles may be duller and, thus, injection more painful. Proper insulin in- jection technique is a requisite for receiv- ing the full dose of insulin with each injection.

These devices de- liver rapid-acting insulin throughout the day to help manage blood glucose levels. Most insulin pumps use tubing to deliver insulin through a cannula, while a few at- tach directly to the skin without tubing. AID systems, which can adjust insulin deliv- ery rates based on current sensor glucose values, are preferred over nonautomated pumps and MDI in people with type 1 diabetes. Most studies comparing MDI with insu- lin pump therapy have been relatively small and of short duration. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that pump therapy has modest advantages for lowering A1C (\u00010.30% [95% CI \u00010.58 to \u00010.02]) and for reduc- ing severe hypoglycemia rates in children and adults (155). There is no consensus to guide choosing which form of insulin administration is best for a given individ- ual, and research to guide this decision- making process is needed (155). Thus, the choice of MDI or an insulin pump is often based upon the characteristics of the per- son with diabetes and which method is most likely to bene\ufb01t them. DiabetesWise (DiabetesWise.org) and the PANTHER Program (pantherprogram.org) have help- ful websites to assist health care profes- sionals and people with diabetes in choosing diabetes devices based on their individual needs and the features of the devices. Newer systems, such as sensor-augmented pumps and AID sys- tems, are discussed below. Adoption of pump therapy in the U.S. shows",

Given the additional barriers to optimal diabetes care ob- served in disadvantaged groups (159), addressing the differences in access to insulin pumps and other diabetes tech- nology may contribute to fewer health disparities. Pump therapy can be successfully started at the time of diagnosis (160,161). Practical aspects of pump therapy initia- tion include assessment of readiness of the person with diabetes and their family, if applicable (although there is no consen- sus on which factors to consider in adults [162] or children and adolescents with di- abetes), selection of pump type and initial pump settings, individual/family education on potential pump complications (e.g., DKA with infusion set failure), transition from MDI, and introduction of advanced pump settings (e.g., temporary basal rates, extended/square/dual wave bolus). Older individuals with type 1 diabetes bene\ufb01t from ongoing insulin pump ther- apy. There are no data to suggest that measurement of C-peptide levels or anti- bodies predicts success with insulin pump therapy (163,164). Additionally, the fre- quency of follow-up does not in\ufb02uence outcomes. Access to insulin pump ther- apy, including AID systems, should be allowed or continued in older adults as it is in younger people.

Other pump skin issues included lipohypertrophy or, less fre- quently, lipoatrophy (166,167) and pump site infection (168). Discontinuation of pump therapy is relatively uncommon today; the frequency has decreased over the past few decades, and its causes have changed (168,169). Current reasons for attrition are problems with cost or wearability, dislike for the pump, sub- optimal glycemic outcomes, or mood dis- orders (e.g., anxiety or depression) (170). Insulin Pumps in Youth The safety of insulin pumps in youth has been established for over 15 years (171). Studying the effectiveness of in- sulin pump therapy in lowering A1C has been challenging because of the potential selection bias of observational studies. Participants on insulin pump therapy may have a higher socioeconomic status that may facilitate better glycemic out- comes (172) versus MDI. In addition, the fast pace of development of new insulins and technologies quickly renders compar- isons obsolete. However, RCTs comparing insulin pumps and MDI with rapid-acting insulin analogs demonstrate a modest im- provement in A1C in participants on insu- lin pump therapy (173,174). Observational studies, registry data, and meta-analysis have also suggested an improvement in glycemic outcomes in participants on insu- lin pump therapy (175\u2013177).

There is also evidence that insulin pump therapy may reduce DKA risk (177,182) and diabetes complications, particularly reti- nopathy and peripheral neuropathy in youth, compared with MDI (162). In addi- tion, treatment satisfaction and quality- of-life measures improved on insulin pump therapy compared with MDI (183,184). Therefore, insulin pumps can be used safely and effectively in youth with type 1 diabetes to assist with achieving targeted glycemic outcomes while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and DKA, improving quality of life, and preventing long-term complications. Based on shared decision- making by people with diabetes and health care professionals, insulin pumps may be considered in all children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In partic- ular, pump therapy may be the preferred mode of insulin delivery for children under 7 years of age (185). Because of a paucity of data in adolescents and youth with type 2 diabetes, there is insuf\ufb01cient ev- idence to make recommendations. Common barriers to pump therapy adoption in children and adolescents are concerns regarding the physical inter- ference of the device, discomfort with the idea of having a device on the body, therapeutic effectiveness, and \ufb01nancial burden (175,186). Sensor-Augmented Pumps Sensor-augmented pumps that suspend insulin when glucose is low or are pre- dicted to go low within the next 30 min have been approved by the FDA.

These devices may offer the opportunity to re- duce hypoglycemia for those with a history of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Additional studies have been performed in adults and children, showing the bene\ufb01ts of this technology (188\u2013190). Automated Insulin Delivery Systems AID systems increase and decrease insu- lin delivery based on sensor-derived glu- cose levels to mimic physiologic insulin delivery. These systems consist of three components: an insulin pump, a contin- uous glucose monitoring system, and an algorithm that calculates insulin delivery. All AID systems on the market today ad- just basal delivery in real time, and some deliver correction doses automatically. While insulin delivery in closed-loop systems eventually may be truly auto- mated, currently used hybrid closed- loop systems require the manual entry of carbohydrates consumed to calcu- late prandial doses, and adjustments for physical activity must be announced. Mul- tiple studies using various systems with varying algorithms, pumps, and sensors have been performed in adults and chil- dren (191\u2013200).

The use of AID systems de- pends on the preference of the person with diabetes and the selection of individ- uals (and/or caregivers) who are capa- ble of safely and effectively using the devices. Insulin Pumps in People With Type 2 and Other Types of Diabetes Traditional insulin pumps can be con- sidered for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes who are on MDI as well as those who have other types of dia- betes resulting in insulin de\ufb01ciency, for instance, those who have had a pancre- atectomy and/or individuals with cystic \ufb01brosis (211\u2013215). Similar to data on in- sulin pump use in people with type 1 di- abetes, reductions in A1C levels are not consistently seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with MDI, al- though this has been seen in some stud- ies (213,216). Use of insulin pumps in insulin-requiring people with any type of diabetes may improve patient satis- faction and simplify therapy (164,211). For people with diabetes judged to be clinically insulin de\ufb01cient who are treated with an intensive insulin therapy, the pres- ence or absence of measurable C-peptide levels does not correlate with response to therapy (164).

E Some people with type 1 diabetes have been using \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d (DIY) systems that combine an insulin pump and an rtCGM with a controller and an algo- rithm designed to automate insulin de- livery (219\u2013223). These systems are not approved by the FDA, although efforts are underway to obtain regulatory ap- proval for some of them. The informa- tion on how to set up and manage these systems is freely available on the internet, and there are internet groups where peo- ple inform each other as to how to set up and use them. Although health care pro- fessionals cannot prescribe these systems, it is crucial to keep people with diabetes safe if they are using these methods for automated insulin delivery. Part of this entails ensuring people have a backup plan in case of pump failure. Addition- ally, in most DIY systems, insulin doses are adjusted based on the pump settings for basal rates, carbohydrate ratios, cor- rection doses, and insulin activity. There- fore, these settings can be evaluated and modi\ufb01ed based on the individual\u2019s insu- lin requirements.

Diabetes, partly because it is both common and numeric, lends itself to the development of apps and online programs. Recommendations for developing and implementing a digital diabetes clinic have been published (224). The FDA approves and monitors clinically validated, digital, and usually online health technologies intended to treat a medical or psychological condition; these are known as digital therapeutics or \u201cdigiceuticals\u201d (fda.gov/medical-devices/ digital-health-center-excellence/device- software-functions-including-mobile-medical- applications) (225). Other applications, such as those that assist in displaying or storing data, encourage a healthy life- style or provide limited clinical data sup- port. Therefore, it is possible to \ufb01nd apps that have been fully reviewed and approved by the FDA and others de- signed and promoted by people with relatively little skill or knowledge in the clinical treatment of diabetes. There is insuf\ufb01cient data to provide recommen- dations for speci\ufb01c apps for diabetes management, education, and support in the absence of RCTs and validations of apps unless they are FDA cleared. An area of particular importance is that of online privacy and security. Estab- lished cloud-based data aggregator pro- grams, such as Tidepool, Glooko, and others, have been developed with appro- priate data security features and are compliant with the U.S. Health Insur- ance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Many online programs offer lifestyle counseling to aid with weight loss and increase physical activity (227). Many in- clude a health coach and can create small groups of similar participants on social networks. Some programs aim to treat prediabetes and prevent progres- sion to diabetes, often following the model of the Diabetes Prevention Program (228,229). Others assist in improving dia- betes outcomes by remotely monitoring clinical data (for instance, wireless monitor- ing of glucose levels, weight, or blood pressure) and providing feedback and coaching (230\u2013235). There are text mes- saging approaches that tie into a variety of different types of lifestyle and treatment programs, which vary in terms of their effectiveness (236,237). There are lim- ited RCT data for many of these inter- ventions, and long-term follow-up is lacking. However, for an individual with diabetes, opting into one of these pro- grams can be helpful in providing support and, for many, is an attractive option.

E Individuals who are comfortable using their diabetes devices, such as insulin pumps and CGM, should be allowed to use them in an inpatient setting if they are well enough to take care of the de- vices and have brought the necessary supplies (238\u2013242). People with diabe- tes who are familiar with treating their own glucose levels can often adjust in- sulin doses more knowledgeably than inpatient staff who do not personally know the individual or their manage- ment style. However, this should occur based on the hospital\u2019s policies for dia- betes management and use of diabetes technology, and there should be super- vision to ensure that the individual is achieving and maintaining glycemic tar- gets during acute illness in a hospitalized setting where factors such as infection, certain medications, immobility, changes in nutrition, and other factors can im- pact insulin sensitivity and the insulin response. With the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the FDA exer- cised enforcement discretion by allow- ing CGM device use temporarily in the hospital for patient monitoring (243). This approach has been used to reduce the use of personal protective equip- ment and more closely monitor patients so that health care personnel do not have to go into a patient room solely to measure a glucose level (244\u2013246).

The most important com- ponent in all of these systems is the per- son with diabetes. Technology selection must be appropriate for the individual. Simply having a device or application does not change outcomes unless the human being engages with it to create positive health bene\ufb01ts.

In people with type 2 diabetes and over- weight or obesity, modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications (7\u20139), and larger weight loss substantially reduces A1C and fasting glucose and has been shown to promote sustained diabetes remission through at least 2 years (11,19\u201323). Several modalities, including intensive behavioral counseling, obesity pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, may aid in achieving and maintaining meaningful weight loss and reducing obesity-associated health risks. Metabolic surgery strongly improves glycemia and often leads to remission of diabe- tes, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced mortal- ity. The importance of addressing obesity is further heightened by numerous studies showing that both obesity and diabetes increase the risk for more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections (24\u201327). This section aims to provide evidence- based recommendations for obesity management, including behavioral, pharmaco- logic, and surgical interventions, in people with type 2 diabetes and in those at risk. This section focuses on obesity management in adults; further discussion on obesity in older individuals and children can be found in Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d and Sec- tion 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d respectively.

Height and weight should be measured to calculate BMI annually or more fre- quently when appropriate (20). BMI, calcu- lated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2), is calcu- lated automatically by most electronic med- ical records. Use BMI to document weight status (overweight: BMI 25\u201329.9 kg/m2; obesity class I: BMI 30\u201334.9 kg/m2; obesity class II: BMI 35\u201339.9 kg/m2; obesity class III: BMI $40 kg/m2) but note that misclassi- \ufb01cation can occur, particularly in very mus- cular or frail individuals. In some groups, notably Asian and Asian American popu- lations, the BMI cut points to de\ufb01ne over- weight and obesity are lower than those in other populations due to differences in body composition and cardiometabolic risk (Table 8.1) (30,31). Clinical considera- tions, such as the presence of comorbid heart failure or unexplained weight change, may warrant more frequent weight mea- surement and evaluation (32,33). If weigh- ing is questioned or refused, the practitioner should be mindful of possible prior stigma- tizing experiences and query for concerns, and the value of weight monitoring should be explained as a part of the medical eval- uation process that helps to inform treat- ment decisions (34,35). Accommodations should be made to ensure privacy during weighing, particularly for those individuals who report or exhibit a high level of weight-related distress or dissatisfaction.

In addition to weight and BMI, assessment of weight distribu- tion (including propensity for central/ visceral adipose deposition) and weight gain pattern and trajectory can further inform risk strati\ufb01cation and treatment options (36). Health care professionals should ad- vise individuals with overweight or obe- sity and those with increasing weight trajectories that, in general, higher BMIs increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovas- cular disease, and all-cause mortality, as well as other adverse health and quality of life outcomes. Health care professio- nals should assess readiness to engage in behavioral changes for weight loss and jointly determine behavioral and weight loss goals and individualized intervention strategies (37). Strategies may include nutri- tion changes, physical activity, behavioral counseling, pharmacologic therapy, medical devices, and metabolic surgery (Table 8.1). The latter three strategies may be consid- ered for carefully selected individuals as adjuncts to nutrition changes, physical ac- tivity, and behavioral counseling. Among people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity who have in- adequate glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control and/or other obesity-related medical conditions, modest and sustained weight loss improves glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids and may reduce the need for medications (7\u20139,38). Greater weight loss may produce even greater bene\ufb01ts (21,22). As little as 3\u20137% weight loss reduces the risk for diabetes in people at risk and improves glycemia in those with diabetes (2,7,8,39,40). Given the challenge of losing weight and",

Nevertheless, mounting data from intensive nutrition and behavioral change interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bar- iatric surgery have shown that more sub- stantial weight loss usually confers still greater bene\ufb01ts on glycemia and possi- bly disease remission as well as other cardiometabolic and quality-of-life out- comes (6,21\u201323,41\u201350). With the increasing availability of more effective obesity treatments, individuals with diabetes and overweight or obesity should be informed of the potential bene- \ufb01ts of both modest and more substantial weight loss and guided in the range of available treatment options, as discussed in the sections below.

Look AHEAD Trial Although the Action for Health in Diabe- tes (Look AHEAD) trial did not show that the intensive lifestyle intervention reduced cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity (39), it did con\ufb01rm the feasibil- ity of achieving and maintaining long- term weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. In the intensive lifestyle inter- vention group, mean weight loss was 4.7% at 8 years (40). Approximately 50% of intensive lifestyle intervention partici- pants lost and maintained $5% of their initial body weight, and 27% lost and maintained $10% of their initial body weight at 8 years (40). Participants as- signed to the intensive lifestyle group required fewer glucose-, blood pressure\u2013, and lipid-lowering medications than those randomly assigned to standard care. Sec- ondary analyses of the Look AHEAD trial and other large cardiovascular outcome studies document additional weight loss bene\ufb01ts in people with type 2 diabetes, including improved mobility, physical and sexual function, and health-related quality of life (32). Moreover, several subgroups had improved cardiovascular outcomes, including those who achieved >10% weight loss (41) and those with moder- ately or poorly managed diabetes (A1C >6.8%) at baseline (42).

Clinical bene\ufb01ts typically be- gin upon achieving 3\u20135% weight loss (20,51), and the bene\ufb01ts of weight loss are progressive; more intensive weight loss goals (>5%, >7%, >15%, etc.) may be pursued if needed to achieve further health improvements and/or if the individ- ual is more motivated and more intensive goals can be feasibly and safely attained. Nutrition interventions may differ by macronutrient goals and food choices as long as they create the necessary en- ergy de\ufb01cit to promote weight loss (20,52\u201354). Using meal replacement plans prescribed by trained practitioners, with close monitoring, can be bene\ufb01cial. Within the intensive lifestyle interven- tion group of the Look AHEAD trial, for example, the use of a partial meal re- placement plan was associated with improvements in nutrition quality and weight loss (51). The nutrition choice should be based on the individual\u2019s health status and preferences, including a determination of food availability and other cultural circumstances that could affect nutrition patterns (55).

People with type 2 diabetes and over- weight or obesity who have lost weight should be offered long-term ($1 year) comprehensive weight loss maintenance programs that provide at least monthly contact with trained interventionists and focus on ongoing monitoring of body weight (weekly or more frequently) and/ or other self-monitoring strategies such as tracking intake, steps, etc.; continued focus on nutrition and behavioral changes; and participation in high levels of physical activity (200\u2013300 min/week) (57).

Despite widespread marketing and ex- orbitant claims, there is no clear evidence that nutrition supplements (such as herbs and botanicals, high-dose vitamins and minerals, amino acids, enzymes, antioxidants, etc.) are effective for obesity manage- ment or weight loss (62\u201364). Several large systematic reviews show that most trials evaluating nutrition supplements for weight loss are of low quality and at high risk for bias. High-quality published studies show little or no weight loss bene\ufb01ts. In contrast, vitamin/mineral (e.g., iron, vitamin B12, vi- tamin D) supplementation may be indicated in cases of documented de\ufb01ciency, and pro- tein supplements may be indicated as ad- juncts to medically supervised weight loss therapies.

Over- whelming research shows that these dis- parities may signi\ufb01cantly affect health outcomes, including increasing the risk for obesity, diabetes, and diabetes-related complications. Health care professionals should evaluate systemic, structural, and socioeconomic factors that may impact food choices, access to healthful foods, and nutrition patterns; behavioral pat- terns, such as neighborhood safety and availability of safe outdoor spaces for phys- ical activity; environmental exposures; ac- cess to health care; social contexts; and, ultimately, diabetes risk and outcomes.

Modeling from published clinical trials consistently shows that early responders have improved long-term out- comes (69\u201371). Unless clinical circumstan- ces (such as poor tolerability) or other considerations (such as \ufb01nancial expense or individual preference) suggest other- wise, those who achieve suf\ufb01cient early weight loss upon starting a chronic weight loss medication (typically de\ufb01ned as >5% weight loss after 3 months\u2019 use) should continue the medication. When early use appears ineffective (typically <5% weight loss after 3 months\u2019 use), it is unlikely that continued use will improve weight out- comes; as such, it should be recom- mended to discontinue the medication and consider other treatment options. MEDICAL DEVICES FOR WEIGHT LOSS While gastric banding devices have fallen out of favor in recent years, since 2015, several minimally invasive medical devices have been approved by the FDA for short- term weight loss, including implanted gas- tric balloons, a vagus nerve stimulator, and gastric aspiration therapy (72).

Given the magnitude and rapid- ity of improvement of hyperglycemia and glucose homeostasis, these procedures have been suggested as treatments for type 2 diabetes even in the absence of severe obesity and will be referred to here as \u201cmetabolic surgery.\u201d A substantial body of evidence, includ- ing data from numerous large cohort studies and randomized controlled (non- blinded) clinical trials, demonstrates that metabolic surgery achieves superior gly- cemic control and reduction of cardio- vascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity compared with nonsurgical intervention (18). In addition to improving glycemia, metabolic surgery reduces the incidence of microvascular disease (75), improves quality of life (43,76,77), decreases cancer risk, and improves cardiovascular disease risk fac- tors and long-term cardiovascular events (78\u201389). Cohort studies that match surgi- cal and nonsurgical subjects strongly sug- gest that metabolic surgery reduces all-cause mortality (90,91). The overwhelming majority of proce- dures in the U.S. are vertical sleeve gas- trectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Both procedures result in an anatomically smaller stomach pouch and often robust changes in enteroendo- crine hormones. In VSG, \u000180% of the stomach is removed, leaving behind a long, thin sleeve-shaped pouch. RYGB creates a much smaller stomach pouch (roughly the size of a walnut), which is then attached to the distal small intes- tine, thereby bypassing the duodenum and jejunum (Fig. 8.1).

Most notably, the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Ef\ufb01ciently (STAMPEDE) trial, which randomized 150 participants with unmanaged diabetes to receive either metabolic surgery or medical treatment, found that 29% of those treated with RYGB and 23% treated with VSG achieved A1C of 6.0% or lower after 5 years (43). Available data suggest an erosion of diabetes remission over time (44); at least 35\u201350% of patients who initially achieve remission of diabetes eventually experience recurrence. Still, the median disease-free period among such individ- uals following RYGB is 8.3 years (94,95), and the majority of those who undergo surgery maintain substantial improve- ment of glycemia from baseline for at least 5\u201315 years (43,76,79,80,95\u201398). Exceedingly few presurgical predictors of success have been identi\ufb01ed, but younger age, shorter duration of diabetes (e.g., <8 years) (70), and lesser severity of diabetes (better glycemic control, non- use of insulin) are associated with higher rates of diabetes remission (43,79,97,99). Greater baseline visceral fat area may also predict improved postoperative out- comes, especially among Asian American people with type 2 diabetes (100).

Major complications occur in 2\u20136% of those undergoing met- abolic surgery, which compares favor- ably with the rates for other commonly performed elective operations (108). Postsurgical recovery times and morbid- ity have also dramatically declined. Minor complications and need for operative rein- tervention occur in up to 15% (104\u2013113). Empirical data suggest that the pro\ufb01ciency of the operating surgeon and surgical team is an important factor in determin- ing mortality, complications, reoperations, and readmissions (114). Accordingly, met- abolic surgery should be performed in high-volume centers with multidisciplinary teams experienced in managing diabetes, obesity, and gastrointestinal surgery. Beyond the perioperative period, longer-term risks include vitamin and mineral de\ufb01ciencies, anemia, osteopo- rosis, dumping syndrome, and severe hypoglycemia (115). Nutritional and micronutrient de\ufb01ciencies and related complications occur with a variable fre- quency depending on the type of proce- dure and require routine monitoring of micronutrient and nutritional status and lifelong vitamin/nutritional supplemen- tation",

    "text": "Postbariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) can occur with RYGB, VSG, and other gastro- intestinal procedures and may severely impact quality of life (116\u2013118). PBH is driven in part by altered gastric empty- ing of ingested nutrients, leading to rapid intestinal glucose absorption and exces- sive postprandial secretion of glucagon- like peptide 1 and other gastrointestinal peptides. As a result, overstimulation of in- sulin release and a sharp drop in plasma glucose occur, most commonly 1\u20133 h after a high-carbohydrate meal. Symptoms range from sweating, tremor, tachycardia, and in- creased hunger to impaired cognition, loss of consciousness, and seizures. In contrast to dumping syndrome, which often occurs soon after surgery and improves over time, PBH typically presents >1 year post-surgery. Diagnosis is primarily made by a thorough history, detailed records of food intake, physical activity, and symp- tom patterns, and exclusion of other potential causes (e.g., malnutrition, side effects of medications or supplements, dumping syndrome, and insulinoma). Ini- tial management includes education to facilitate reduced intake of rapidly di- gested carbohydrates while ensuring ade- quate intake of protein and healthy fats, and vitamin/nutrient supplements. When available, patients should be offered medi- cal nutrition therapy with a dietitian expe- rienced in PBH and the use of continuous glucose monitoring (ideally real-time con- tinuous glucose monitoring, which can detect dropping glucose levels before se- vere hypoglycemia occurs), especially for those with hypoglycemia unawareness. Medication treatment, if needed, is pri- marily aimed at slowing carbohydrate absorption (e.g., acarbose) or reducing glucagon-like peptide 1 and insulin secre-",

People who undergo metabolic surgery may also be at increased risk for substance abuse, worsening or new-onset depression and/or anxiety disorders, and suicidal idea- tion (115,120\u2013125). Candidates for meta- bolic surgery should be assessed by a mental health professional with expertise in obesity management prior to consider- ation for surgery (126). Surgery should be postponed in individuals with alcohol or substance use disorders, severe depres- sion, suicidal ideation, or other signi\ufb01cant mental health conditions until these condi- tions have been suf\ufb01ciently addressed. In- dividuals with preoperative or new-onset psychopathology should be assessed regu- larly following surgery to optimize mental health and postsurgical outcomes. References 1.

B Insulin Therapy Because the hallmark of type 1 diabetes is absent or near-absent b-cell function, insulin treatment is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes. In addition to hy- perglycemia, insulinopenia can contribute to other metabolic disturbances like hy- pertriglyceridemia and ketoacidosis as well as tissue catabolism that can be life threatening. Severe metabolic decompensation can be, and was, mostly prevented with once- or twice-daily injections for the six or seven decades after the discovery of insulin. However, over the past three decades, evidence has accumulated sup- porting more intensive insulin replacement, using multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous subcutaneous administration through an insulin pump, as providing the best combination of effectiveness and safety for people with type 1 diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) reduced A1C and was associated with improved long-term outcomes (1\u20133).

In this landmark trial, lower A1C with intensive control (7%) led to \u000150% reductions in micro- vascular complications over 6 years of treatment. However, intensive therapy was associated with a higher rate of se- vere hypoglycemia than conventional treatment (62 compared with 19 epi- sodes per 100 patient-years of therapy). Follow-up of subjects from the DCCT more than 10 years after the active treat- ment component of the study demon- strated fewer macrovascular as well as fewer microvascular complications in the group that received intensive treatment (2,4). Insulin replacement regimens typically consist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and correction insulin (5). Basal insulin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin analogs, and continuous delivery of rapid- acting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal insulin analogs have longer duration of action with \ufb02atter, more constant plasma concentrations and activity pro\ufb01les than NPH insulin; rapid-acting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onset and peak and shorter duration of action than regular human in- sulin. In people with type 1 diabetes, treat- ment with analog insulins is associated with less hypoglycemia and weight gain as well as lower A1C compared with human insulins (6\u20138). More recently, two inject- able insulin formulations with enhanced rapid-action pro\ufb01les have been introduced. Inhaled human insulin has a rapid peak and shortened duration of action com- pared with RAA and may cause less hypo- glycemia and weight gain (9) (see also subsection ALTERNATIVE INSULIN ROUTES in PHARMACOLOGIC",

In addition, longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) may confer a lower hypoglycemia risk compared with U-100 glargine in individuals with type 1 diabetes (13,14). Despite the advantages of insulin analogs in individuals with type 1 diabetes, for some individuals the expense and/or intensity of treatment required for their use is prohibitive. There are multiple approaches to insulin treatment, and the central precept in the management of type 1 diabetes is that some form of insu- lin be given in a planned regimen tailored to the individual to keep them safe and out of diabetic ketoacidosis and to avoid signi\ufb01cant hypoglycemia, with every ef- fort made to reach the individual\u2019s gly- cemic targets. Most studies comparing multiple daily injections with CSII have been relatively small and of short duration. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis con- cluded that CSII via pump therapy has modest advantages for lowering A1C (\u00030.30% [95% CI \u00030.58 to \u00030.02]) and for reducing severe hypoglycemia rates in children and adults (15). However, there is no consensus to guide the choice of injection or pump therapy in a given individual, and research to guide this deci- sion-making is needed (16). The arrival of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to clinical practice has proven bene\ufb01cial in people using insulin therapy. Its use is now considered standard of care for most people with type 1 diabetes",

Reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with CGM is improved by automatic sus- pension of insulin delivery at a preset glu- cose level (16\u201318). When choosing among insulin delivery systems, individual pref- erences, cost, insulin type and dosing regimen, and self-management capabili- ties should be considered (see Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d). The U.S. Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) has now approved multiple hybrid closed-loop pump systems (also called automated insulin delivery [AID] systems). The safety and ef\ufb01cacy of hybrid closed-loop systems has been supported in the literature in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes (19,20), and evi- dence suggests that a closed-loop system is superior to sensor-augmented pump therapy for glycemic control and reduction of hypoglycemia over 3 months of com- parison in children and adults with type 1 diabetes (21). In the International Diabe- tes Closed Loop (iDCL) trial, a 6-month trial in people with type 1 diabetes at least 14 years of age, the use of a closed- loop system was associated with a greater percentage of time spent in the target gly- cemic range, reduced mean glucose and A1C levels, and a lower percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia compared with use of a sensor-augmented pump (22). Intensive insulin management using a version of CSII and continuous glucose monitoring should be considered in most individuals with type 1 diabetes.

See Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d for a full discus- sion of insulin delivery devices. In general, individuals with type 1 dia- betes require 50% of their daily insulin as basal and 50% as prandial, but this is dependent on a number of factors, in- cluding whether the individual consumes lower or higher carbohydrate meals. To- tal daily insulin requirements can be esti- mated based on weight, with typical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg/ day. Higher amounts are required during puberty, pregnancy, and medical illness. The American Diabetes Association/JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook notes 0.5 units/ kg/day as a typical starting dose in indi- viduals with type 1 diabetes who are metabolically stable, with half adminis- tered as prandial insulin given to control blood glucose after meals and the other half as basal insulin to control glycemia in the periods between meal absorption (23); this guideline provides detailed in- formation on intensi\ufb01cation of therapy to meet individualized needs.

The optimal time to administer prandial insulin varies, based on the phar- macokinetics of the formulation (regular, RAA, inhaled), the premeal blood glucose level, and carbohydrate consumption. Rec- ommendations for prandial insulin dose administration should therefore be individ- ualized. Physiologic insulin secretion varies with glycemia, meal size, meal composi- tion, and tissue demands for glucose. To approach this variability in people using insulin treatment, strategies have evolved to adjust prandial doses based on pre- dicted needs.

Insulin Injection Technique Ensuring that individuals and/or caregivers understand correct insulin injection tech- nique is important to optimize glucose control and insulin use safety. Thus, it is important that insulin be delivered into the proper tissue in the correct way. Rec- ommendations have been published else- where outlining best practices for insulin injection (28). Proper insulin injection tech- nique includes injecting into appropriate body areas, injection site rotation, appro- priate care of injection sites to avoid infec- tion or other complications, and avoidance of intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery.

Risk for IM insulin delivery is increased in younger, leaner individuals when injecting into the limbs rather than truncal sites (abdomen and buttocks) and when using longer needles. Recent evidence supports the use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen needles) as effec- tive and well tolerated when compared with longer needles, including a study per- formed in adults with obesity (29). Injection site rotation is additionally nec- essary to avoid lipohypertrophy, an accu- mulation of subcutaneous fat in response to the adipogenic actions of insulin at a site of multipleinjections. Lipohypertrophy ap- pears as soft, smooth raised areas several centimeters in breadth and can contribute to erratic insulin absorption, increased glycemic variability, and unexplained hypoglycemic episodes. People treated with insulin and/or caregivers should receive education about proper injec- tion site rotation and how to recognize and avoid areas of lipohypertrophy. As noted in Table 4.1, examination of insu- lin injection sites for the presence of lipo- hypertrophy, as well as assessment of injection device use and injection tech- nique, are key components of a compre- hensive diabetes medical evaluation and treatment plan. Proper insulin injection technique may lead to more effective use of this therapy and, as such, holds the po- tential for improved clinical outcomes.

A ran- domized trial con\ufb01rmed previous obser- vations that metformin use is associated with vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency and worsen- ing of symptoms of neuropathy (50). This is compatible with a report from the Di- abetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) suggesting periodic test- ing of vitamin B12 (51) (see Section 3, \u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\u201d). When A1C is $1.5% (12.5 mmol/mol) above the glycemic target (see Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for appropriate tar- gets), many individuals will require dual- combination therapy or a more potent glucose-lowering agent to achieve and maintain their target A1C level (45,52) (Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2). Insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents are not and should be considered as part of any combination regimen when hyperglycemia is severe, espe- cially if catabolic features (weight loss, hypertriglyceridemia, ketosis) are pre- sent. It is common practice to initiate in- sulin therapy for people who present with blood glucose levels $300 mg/dL (16.7mmol/L)orA1C>10%(86mmol/mol) or if the individual has symptoms of hy- perglycemia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evidence of catabolism (weight loss) (Fig. 9.4).

Combination Therapy Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease in many individuals, maintenance of glycemic targets often requires com- bination therapy. Traditional recommen- dations have been to use stepwise addition of medications to metformin to maintain A1C at target. The advantage of this is to provide a clear assessment of the positive and negative effects of new drugs and re- duce potential side effects and expense (54). However, there are data to support initial combination therapy for more rapid attainment of glycemic goals (55,56) and later combination therapy for longer durability of glycemic effect (57). The VERIFY (Vildagliptin Ef\ufb01cacy in combina- tion with metfoRmln For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes) trial demonstrated that initial combination therapy is supe- rior to sequential addition of medications for extending primary and secondary fail- ure (58). In the VERIFY trial, participants receiving the initial combination of met- formin and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin had a slower decline of glycemic control compared with metformin alone and with vildagliptin added sequentially to metformin. These results have not been generalized to oral agents other than vildagliptin, but they suggest that more intensive early treat- ment has some bene\ufb01ts and should be considered through a shared decision- making process, as appropriate. Initial combination therapy should be consid- ered in people presenting with A1C levels 1.5\u20132.0% above target. Finally, incorpora- tion of high-glycemic-ef\ufb01cacy therapies or therapies for cardiovascular/renal risk re- duction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2",

Thus, treatment intensi\ufb01cation may not neces- sarily follow a pure sequential addition of therapy but instead re\ufb02ect a tailoring of the regimen in alignment with person- centered treatment goals (Fig. 9.3). Recommendations for treatment in- tensi\ufb01cation for people not meeting treatment goals should not be delayed. Shared decision-making is important in discussions regarding treatment intensi- \ufb01cation. The choice of medication added to initial therapy is based on the clinical characteristics of the individual and their preferences. Important clinical character- istics include the presence of established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, CKD, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and risk for speci\ufb01c adverse drug effects, as well as safety, tolerability, and cost. Results from comparative effectiveness meta-analyses suggest that each new class of noninsulin agents added to initial therapy with metformin generally lowers A1C approximately 0.7\u20131.0% (59,60) (Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2). For people with type 2 diabetes and es- tablished ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated CVD bene\ufb01t (see Table 9.2, Table 10.3B, Table 10.3C, and Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\u201d) is recom- mended as part of the glucose-lowering regimen independent of A1C, independent of metformin use and in consideration of person-speci\ufb01c factors (Fig. 9.3).

A systematic re- view and network meta-analysis suggests greatest reductions in A1C level with insu- lin regimens and speci\ufb01c GLP-1 RAs added to metformin-based background ther- apy (62). In all cases, treatment regimens need to be continuously reviewed for ef\ufb01- cacy, side effects, and burden (Table 9.2). In some instances, the individual will re- quire medication reduction or discontinu- ation. Common reasons for this include ineffectiveness, intolerable side effects, expense, or a change in glycemic goals (e.g., in response to development of comor- bidities or changes in treatment goals). Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d has a full dis- cussion of treatment considerations in older adults, in whom changes of glyce- mic goals and de-escalation of therapy are common. The need for the greater potency of injectable medications is common, par- ticularly in people with a longer dura- tion of diabetes. The addition of basal insulin, either human NPH or one of the long-acting insulin analogs, to oral agent regimens is a well-established approach that is effective for many individuals. In addition, evidence supports the utility of GLP-1 RAs in people not at glycemic goal. While most GLP-1 RAs are inject- able, an oral formulation of semaglutide is commercially available (63).

However, cost and tolerability issues are important considerations in GLP-1 RA use. Costs for diabetes medications have increased dramatically over the past two decades, and an increasing proportion is now passed on to patients and their fami- lies (71). Table 9.3 provides cost informa- tion for currently approved noninsulin therapies. Of note, prices listed are average wholesale prices (AWP) (72) and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) (73), separate measures to allow for a comparison of drug prices, but do not ac- count for discounts, rebates, or other price adjustments often involved in prescription sales that affect the actual cost incurred by the patient. Medication costs can be a ma- jor source of stress for people with diabetes and contribute to worse medication-taking behavior (74); cost-reducing strategies may improve medication-taking behavior in some cases (75). Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials There are now multiple large randomized controlled trials reporting statistically signif- icant reductions in cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA; see Sec- tion 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\u201d for details.

For these individuals, incorpo- rating one of the SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have been demonstrated to have cardiovascular disease bene\ufb01t is recommended (see Fig. 9.3, Table 9.2, and Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\u201d). Emerging data sug- gest that use of both classes of drugs will provide additional cardiovascular and kidney outcomes bene\ufb01t; thus, combi- nation therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 RA may be considered to provide the complementary outcomes bene\ufb01ts associated with these classes of medication (76).

    "text": "or punishment. Rather, the utility and im- portance of insulin to maintain glycemic control once progression of the disease overcomes the effect of other agents should be emphasized. Educating and involving patients in insulin management is bene\ufb01cial. For example, instruction of individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin in self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves gly- cemic control (77). Comprehensive educa- tion regarding blood glucose monitoring, nutrition, and the avoidance and appro- priate treatment of hypoglycemia are critically important in any individual using insulin. Basal Insulin Basal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to metformin and other noninsulin inject- ables. Starting doses can be estimated based on body weight (0.1\u20130.2 units/kg/day) and the degree of hyperglycemia, with individualized titration over days to weeks as needed. The principal action of basal insulin is to restrain hepatic glucose pro- duction and limit hyperglycemia overnight and between meals (78,79). Control of fasting glucose can be achieved with hu- man NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin (80\u201385), al- though these advantages are modest and may not persist (86). Longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) may convey a lower hypoglycemia risk com- pared with U-100 glargine when used in combination with oral agents (87\u201393).

Clinical signals that may prompt evaluation of overbasalization include basal dose greater than \u00010.5 units/kg, high bedtime\u2013morning or postprepran- dial glucose differential (e.g., bedtime\u2013 morning glucose differential $50 mg/dL), hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high variability. Indication of overbasali- zation should prompt reevaluation to further individualize therapy (94). The cost of insulin has been rising steadily over the past two decades, at a pace severalfold that of other medical ex- penditures (95). This expense contributes signi\ufb01cant burden to patients as insulin has become a growing \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d cost for people with diabetes, and direct patient costs contribute to decrease in medication-taking behavior (95). There- fore, consideration of cost is an impor- tant component of effective management. For many individuals with type 2 diabetes (e.g., individuals with relaxed A1C goals, low rates of hypoglycemia, and promi- nent insulin resistance, as well as those with cost concerns), human insulin (NPH and regular) may be the appropriate choice of therapy, and clinicians should be familiar with its use (96). Human regu- lar insulin, NPH, and 70/30 NPH/regular products can be purchased for consider- ably less than the AWP and NADAC prices listed in Table 9.4 at select pharmacies. Ad- ditionally, approval of follow-on biologics for insulin glargine, the \ufb01rst interchange- able insulin glargine product, and generic versions of analog insulins may expand cost-effective options.

For individuals who advance to prandial in- sulin, a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the great- est postprandial excursion is a safe esti- mate for initiating therapy. The prandial insulin regimen can then be intensi\ufb01ed based on individual needs (Fig. 9.4). In- dividuals with type 2 diabetes are gen- erally more insulin resistant than those with type 1 diabetes, require higher daily doses (\u00011 unit/kg), and have lower rates of hypoglycemia (97). Titration can be based on home glucose monitoring or A1C.

U-300 glargine has a longer duration of action than U-100 glargine but modestly lower ef\ufb01cacy per unit administered (101,102). The FDA has also approved a concentrated formulation of rapid-acting insulin lispro, U-200 (200 units/mL), and insulin lispro- aabc (U-200). These concentrated prepa- rations may be more convenient and comfortable for individuals to inject and may improve treatment plan engage- ment in those with insulin resistance who require large doses of insulin. While U-500 regular insulin is available in both pre\ufb01lled pens and vials, other concen- trated insulins are available only in pre- \ufb01lled pens to minimize the risk of dosing errors. Alternative Insulin Routes Insulins with different routes of admin- istration (inhaled, bolus-only insulin de- livery patch pump) are also available (45). Inhaled insulin is available as a rapid-acting insulin; studies in individu- als with type 1 diabetes suggest rapid pharmacokinetics (8). Studies comparing inhaled insulin with injectable insulin have demonstrated its faster onset and shorter duration compared with rapid- acting insulin lispro as well as clinically meaningful A1C reductions and weight reductions compared with insulin aspart over 24 weeks (103\u2013105). Use of in- haled insulin may result in a decline in lung function (reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]).

    "text": "recommended in individuals who smoke or who recently stopped smoking. All individuals require spirometry (FEV1) testing to identify potential lung disease prior to and after starting inhaled insulin therapy. Combination Injectable Therapy If basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level (or if the dose is >0.5 units/kg/day with indications of need for other therapy) and A1C remains above target, consider advancing to combination injectable therapy (Fig. 9.4). This approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of insulin. The combination of basal insu- lin and GLP-1 RA has potent glucose- lowering actions and less weight gain and hypoglycemia compared with inten- si\ufb01ed insulin regimens (106\u2013111). The DUAL VIII (Durability of Insulin Degludec Plus Liraglutide Versus Insulin Glargine U100 as Initial Injectable Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes) randomized controlled trial dem- onstrated greater durability of glycemic treatment effect with the combination GLP-1 RA\u2013insulin therapy compared with addition of basal insulin alone (57). In se- lect individuals, complex insulin regimens can also be simpli\ufb01ed with combination GLP-1 RA\u2013insulin therapy in type 2 diabe- tes (112). Two different once-daily, \ufb01xed dual combination products containing basal insulin plus a GLP-1 RA are available: insulin glargine plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) and insu- lin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira). Intensi\ufb01cation of insulin treatment can be done by adding doses of prandial insu- lin to basal insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and",

    "text": "effective, and it can be advanced to a regimen with multiple prandial doses if necessary (113). Alterna- tively, in an individual on basal insulin in whom additional prandial coverage is de- sired, the regimen can be converted to two doses of a premixed insulin. Each ap- proach has advantages and disadvantages. For example, basal-prandial regimens offer greater \ufb02exibility for individuals who eat on irregular schedules. On the other hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a simple, conve- nient means of spreading insulin across the day. Moreover, human insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as premixed NPH/regular (70/ 30) formulations, are less costly alternatives to insulin analogs. Figure 9.4 outlines these options as well as recommendations for fur- ther intensi\ufb01cation, if needed, to achieve glycemic goals.When initiating combination injectable therapy, metformin therapy should be maintained, while sulfonylureas and DPP-4 inhibitors are typically weaned or discontinued. In individuals with sub- optimal blood glucose control, especially those requiring large insulin doses, ad- junctive use of a thiazolidinedione or an SGLT2 inhibitor may help to improve con- trol and reduce the amount of insulin needed, though potential side effects should be considered. Once a basal-bolus insulin regimen is initiated, dose titration is im- portant, with adjustments made in both mealtime and basal insulins based on the blood glucose levels and an understand- ing of the pharmacodynamic pro\ufb01le of each formulation (also known as pattern control or pattern management).

    "text": "morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and results in an estimated $37.3 billion in cardiovascular-related spending per year associated with diabetes (1). Common conditions coexisting with type 2 diabetes (e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia) are clear risk factors for ASCVD, and diabetes itself confers independent risk. Numerous studies have shown the ef\ufb01- cacy of controlling individual cardiovascular risk factors in preventing or slowing ASCVD in people with diabetes. Furthermore, large bene\ufb01ts are seen when multiple cardiovascular risk factors are addressed simultaneously. Under the current paradigm of aggressive risk factor modi\ufb01cation in people with diabetes, there is evidence that measures of 10-year CHD risk among U.S. adults with diabetes have improved signi\ufb01- cantly over the past decade (2) and that ASCVD morbidity and mortality have de- creased (3,4). Heart failure is another major cause of morbidity and mortality from cardiovas- cular disease. Recent studies have found that rates of incident heart failure hospi- talization (adjusted for age and sex) were twofold higher in people with diabetes compared with those without (5,6). People with diabetes may have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Hypertension is often a precursor of heart failure of either type, and ASCVD can co- exist with either type (7), whereas prior myocardial infarction (MI) is often a major factor in HFrEF. Rates of heart failure hospitalization have been improved in recent trials including people with type 2 diabetes, most of whom also had ASCVD, with sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (8\u201311).",

    "text": "A recent meta-analysis indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular mor- tality, and all-cause mortality in people with (secondary prevention) and without (primary prevention) cardiovascular dis- ease (12). For prevention and management of both ASCVD and heart failure, cardio- vascular risk factors should be systemat- ically assessed at least annually in all people with diabetes. These risk factors include duration of diabetes, obesity/ overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, a family history of premature coronary disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the presence of albuminuria. Modi\ufb01able abnormal risk factors should be treated as described in these guide- lines. Notably, the majority of evidence supporting interventions to reduce car- diovascular risk in diabetes comes from trials of people with type 2 diabetes. No randomized trials have been speci\ufb01cally designed to assess the impact of cardio- vascular risk reduction strategies in peo- ple with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the recommendations for cardiovascular risk factor modi\ufb01cation for people with type 1 diabetes are extrapolated from data ob- tained in people with type 2 diabetes and are similar to those for people with type 2 diabetes. As depicted in Fig. 10.1, a comprehen- sive approach to the reduction in risk of diabetes-related complications is recom- mended. Therapy that includes multiple, concurrent evidence-based approaches to care will provide complementary reduc- tion in the risks of microvascular, kidney, neurologic, and cardiovascular complica- tions.

THE RISK CALCULATOR The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD risk calculator (Risk Estimator Plus) is generally a useful tool to estimate 10-year risk of a \ufb01rst ASCVD event (available online at tools. acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus). The calculator includes diabetes as a risk fac- tor, since diabetes itself confers increased risk for ASCVD, although it should be ac- knowledged that these risk calculators do not account for the duration of diabetes or the presence of diabetes complications, such as albuminuria. Although some vari- ability in calibration exists in various sub- groups, including by sex, race, and diabetes, the overall risk prediction does not differ in those with or without diabetes (13\u201316), validating the use of risk calculators in people with diabetes. The 10-year risk of a \ufb01rst ASCVD event should be assessed to better stratify ASCVD risk and help guide therapy, as described below. Recently, risk scores and other cardio- vascular biomarkers have been devel- oped for risk strati\ufb01cation of secondary prevention patients (i.e., those who are already high risk because they have ASCVD) but are not yet in widespread use (17,18). With newer, more expen- sive lipid-lowering therapies now avail- able, use of these risk assessments may help target these new therapies to \u201chigher risk\u201d ASCVD patients in the future.

Hypertension is common among people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hypertension is a major risk factor for both ASCVD and microvascular complications.

Elevated values should preferably be con\ufb01rmed on a separate day; however, in individuals with cardio- vascular disease and blood pressure $180/110 mmHg, it is reasonable to diag- nose hypertension at a single visit (21). Postural changes in blood pressure and pulse may be evidence of autonomic neu- ropathy and therefore require adjustment of blood pressure targets. Orthostatic blood pressure measurements should be checked on initial visit and as indicated.

Treatment Goals Recommendations 10.3 For people with diabetes and hypertension, blood pressure targets should be individual- ized through a shared decision- making process that addresses cardiovascular risk, potential ad- verse effects of antihypertensive medications, and patient prefer- ences. B 10.4 People with diabetes and hypertension qualify for anti- hypertensive drug therapy when the blood pressure is persistently elevated $130/80 mmHg. The on-treatment target blood pres- sure goal is <130/80 mmHg, if it can be safely attained. B 10.5 In pregnant individuals with dia- betes and chronic hypertension, a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mmHg for initiation or titration of therapy is asso- ciated with better pregnancy outcomes than reserving treat- ment for severe hypertension, with no increase in risk of small-for-gestational age birth weight.

The committee\u2019s recommen- dation for the blood pressure target of <130/80 mmHg derives primarily from the collective evidence of the following randomized controlled trials. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated that treatment to a target systolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg decreases cardiovascular event rates by 25% in high-risk patients, although people with diabetes were excluded from this trial (33). The recently completed Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial included nearly 20% of people with diabetes and noted decreased cardiovas- cular events with treatment of hyper- tension to a blood pressure target of <130 mmHg (34). While the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) blood pressure trial (ACCORD BP) did not con\ufb01rm that targeting a sys- tolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg in people with diabetes results in decreased cardiovascular event rates, the prespeci- \ufb01ed secondary outcome of stroke was re- duced by 41% with intensive treatment (35).

Therefore, it is rec- ommended that people with diabetes who have hypertension should be treated to blood pressure targets of <130/80 mmHg. Notably, there is an absence of high-quality data available to guide blood pressure targets in peo- ple with type 1 diabetes, but a similar blood pressure target of <130/80 mmHg is recommended in people with type 1 diabetes. As discussed below, treat- ment should be individualized and treatment should not be targeted to <120/80 mmHg, as a mean achieved blood pressure of <120/80 mmHg is associated with adverse events.

The results have been interpreted to be generally consis- tent between both trials, but ACCORD BP was viewed as underpowered due to the composite primary end point being less sensitive to blood pressure regulation (33).

Diuretics are not recommended for blood pressure control in pregnancy but may be used during late-stage pregnancy if needed for volume control (49,50). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo- gists also recommends that postpartum individuals with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and superimposed pre- eclampsia have their blood pressures observed for 72 h in the hospital and for 7\u201310 days postpartum. Long-term follow-up is recommended for these individuals as they have increased life- time cardiovascular risk (51). See Sec- tion 15, \u201cManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy,\u201d for additional information. Treatment Strategies Lifestyle Intervention Recommendation 10.6 For people with blood pressure >120/80 mmHg, lifestyle inter- vention consists of weight loss when indicated, a Dietary Ap- proaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style eating pattern in- cluding reducing sodium and increasing potassium intake, moderation of alcohol in- take, and increased physi- cal activity. A Lifestyle management is an important component of hypertension treatment because it lowers blood pressure, enhan- ces the effectiveness of some antihyper- tensive medications, promotes other aspects of metabolic and vascular health, and generally leads to few adverse ef- fects. Lifestyle therapy consists of reduc- ing excess body weight through caloric restriction (see Section 8, \u201cObesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d), at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aer- obic activity per week (see Section 3, \u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\u201d), restricting sodium intake (<2,300 mg/day), increasing",

For patients with albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] $30 mg/g), initial treatment should include an ACE inhibitor or ARB to reduce the risk of progressive kidney dis- ease (20) (Fig. 10.2). In patients receiving ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, continua- tion of those medications as kidney func- tion declines to estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 may provide cardiovascular bene\ufb01t with- out signi\ufb01cantly increasing the risk of end-stage kidney disease (67). In the ab- sence of albuminuria, risk of progressive kidney disease is low, and ACE inhibitors and ARBs have not been found to afford superior cardioprotection when compared with thiazide-like diuretics or dihydro- pyridine calcium channel blockers (68). b-Blockers are indicated in the setting of prior MI, active angina, or HfrEF but have not been shown to reduce mortality as blood pressure-lowering agents in the absence of these conditions (28,69,70).

Therefore, preferen- tial use of antihypertensives at bedtime is not recommended (76). Hyperkalemia and Acute Kidney Injury. Treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs can cause AKI and hyperkalemia, while diuretics can cause AKI and either hypo- kalemia or hyperkalemia (depending on mechanism of action) (77,78). Detection and management of these abnormalities is important because AKI and hyperkale- mia each increase the risks of cardiovas- cular events and death (79). Therefore, serum creatinine and potassium should be monitored during treatment with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or diuretic, particularly among patients with reduced glomerular \ufb01ltration who are at increased risk of hy- perkalemia and AKI (77,78,80).

However, adding a mineralocorticoid re- ceptor antagonist to a regimen including an ACE inhibitor or ARB may increase the risk for hyperkalemia, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring for serum creatinine and potassium in these patients, and long-term outcome studies are needed to better evaluate the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in blood pressure management.

Multiple clinical trials have dem- onstrated the bene\ufb01cial effects of statin therapy on ASCVD outcomes in subjects with and without CHD (90,91). Sub- group analyses of people with diabetes in larger trials (92\u201396) and trials in peo- ple with diabetes (97,98) showed signi\ufb01- cant primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events and CHD death in peo- ple with diabetes. Meta-analyses, includ- ing data from over 18,000 people with diabetes from 14 randomized trials of statin therapy (mean follow-up 4.3 years), demonstrate a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality and 13% reduction in vascular mortality for each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol (99). The cardiovascular bene\ufb01t in this large meta-analysis did not depend on baseline LDL cholesterol levels and was linearly related to the LDL cholesterol re- duction without a low threshold beyond which there was no bene\ufb01t observed (99). Accordingly, statins are the drugs of choice for LDL cholesterol lowering and cardioprotection. Table 10.2 shows the two statin dosing intensities that are rec- ommended for use in clinical practice: high-intensity statin therapy will achieve approximately a $50% reduction in LDL cholesterol, and moderate-intensity statin regimens achieve 30\u201349% reductions in LDL cholesterol.

Primary Prevention (People Without ASCVD) For primary prevention, moderate-dose statin therapy is recommended for those aged $40 years (93,100,101), although high-intensity therapy should be consid- ered in the context of additional ASCVD risk factors. The evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40\u201375 years, an age-group well represented in statin trials showing bene\ufb01t. Since cardiovascu- lar risk is enhanced in people with diabe- tes, as noted above, patients who also have multiple other coronary risk factors have increased risk, equivalent to that of those with ASCVD. Therefore, current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardio- vascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to re- duce LDL cholesterol by $50% from baseline and to target an LDL cholesterol of <70 mg/dL (102\u2013104).

Based on the evidence discussed below, addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recom- mended if this goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy. These recommendations are based on the ob- servation that high-intensity versus mod- erate-intensity statin therapy reduces cardiovascular event rates in high-risk in- dividuals with established cardiovascular disease in randomized trials (95,107).

Individuals were $50 years of age, had experienced a recent acute coronary syn- drome (ACS) and were treated for an av- erage of 6 years. Overall, the addition of ezetimibe led to a 6.4% relative bene\ufb01t and a 2% absolute reduction in major ad- verse cardiovascular events (atheroscle- rotic cardiovascular events), with the degree of bene\ufb01t being directly propor- tional to the change in LDL cholesterol, which was 70 mg/dL in the statin group on average and 54 mg/dL in the combi- nation group (105). In those with diabetes (27% of participants), the combination of moderate-intensity simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) showed a signi\ufb01- cant reduction of major adverse cardio- vascular events with an absolute risk reduction of 5% (40% vs. 45% cumula- tive incidence at 7 years) and a relative risk reduction of 14% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.78\u20130.94]) over moderate- intensity simvastatin (40 mg) alone (109).

No cardiovascular outcome trials have been performed to assess whether PCSK9 inhibitor therapy reduces ASCVD event rates in individuals without established car- diovascular disease (primary prevention). The effects of PCSK9 inhibition on ASCVD outcomes was investigated in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Sub- jects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, which enrolled 27,564 individuals with prior ASCVD and an additional high-risk feature who were receiving their maxi- mum tolerated statin therapy (two- thirds were on high-intensity statin) but who still had LDL cholesterol $70 mg/dL or non-HDL cholesterol $100 mg/dL (108). Patients were randomized to re- ceive subcutaneous injections of evolo- cumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg every month based on patient preference) versus placebo.

An analysis of one of the initial studies suggested that although statin use was associated with diabetes risk, the cardiovascular event rate reduction with statins far outweighed the risk of incident diabetes even for patients at highest risk for diabetes (131). The ab- solute risk increase was small (over 5 years of follow-up, 1.2% of participants on placebo developed diabetes and 1.5% on rosuvastatin developed diabetes) (131). A meta-analysis of 13 randomized statin trials with 91,140 participants showed an odds ratio of 1.09 for a new diagnosis of diabetes, so that (on average) treatment of 255 patients with statins for 4 years re- sulted in one additional case of diabetes while simultaneously preventing 5.4 vascu- lar events among those 255 patients (130). Lipid-Lowering Agents and Cognitive Function Although concerns regarding a potential adverse impact of lipid-lowering agents on cognitive function have been raised, several lines of evidence point against this association, as detailed in a 2018 European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel statement (132). First, there are three large randomized trials of statin versus pla- cebo where speci\ufb01c cognitive tests were performed, and no differences were seen between statin and placebo (133\u2013136).

A Risk Reduction Aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with previ- ous MI or stroke (secondary prevention) and is strongly recommended. In pri- mary prevention, however, among pa- tients with no previous cardiovascular events, its net bene\ufb01t is more contro- versial (129,140). Previous randomized controlled trials of aspirin speci\ufb01cally in people with dia- betes failed to consistently show a signi\ufb01- cant reduction in overall ASCVD end points, raising questions about the ef\ufb01- cacy of aspirin for primary prevention in people with diabetes, although some sex differences were suggested (141\u2013143).

In ASPREE, including 19,114 in- dividuals, for cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD, MI, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) after a median of 4.7 years of follow-up, the rates per 1,000 person- years were 10.7 vs. 11.3 events in aspirin vs. placebo groups (HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.83\u20131.08]).

Thus, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on ischemic vascular events, with the absolute decrease in events depending on the underlying ASCVD risk.The main ad- verse effect is an increased risk of gastroin- testinal bleeding. The excess risk may be as high as 5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings. However, for adults with ASCVD risk >1% per year, the number of ASCVD events prevented will be similar to the number of episodes of bleeding induced, although these complications do not have equal effects on long-term health (147). Recommendations for using aspirin as primary prevention include both men and women aged $50 years with diabetes and at least one additional major risk factor (family history of premature ASCVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smok- ing, or CKD/albuminuria) who are not at increased risk of bleeding (e.g., older age, anemia, renal disease) (148\u2013151).

For people >70 years of age (with or without diabe- tes), the balance appears to have greater risk than bene\ufb01t (144,146). Thus, for pri- mary prevention, the use of aspirin needs to be carefully considered and may gener- ally not be recommended. Aspirin may be considered in the context of high car- diovascular risk with low bleeding risk, but generally not in older adults. Aspirin therapy for primary prevention may be considered in the context of shared deci- sion-making, which carefully weighs the cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts with the fairly comparable increase in risk of bleeding. For people with documented ASCVD, use of aspirin for secondary prevention has far greater bene\ufb01t than risk; for this indica- tion, aspirin is still recommended (139). Aspirin Use in People <50 Years of Age Aspirin is not recommended for those at low risk of ASCVD (such as men and women aged <50 years with diabetes with no other major ASCVD risk factors) as the low bene\ufb01t is likely to be out- weighed by the risks of bleeding. Clini- cal judgment should be used for those at intermediate risk (younger patients with one or more risk factors or older patients with no risk factors) until fur- ther research is available.

    "text": "diabetes, there were no signi\ufb01cant dif- ferences in cardiovascular events or ma- jor bleeding between patients assigned to 81 mg and those assigned to 325 mg of aspirin daily (156). In the U.S., the most common low-dose tablet is 81 mg. Although platelets from people with di- abetes have altered function, it is un- clear what, if any, effect that \ufb01nding has on the required dose of aspirin for car- dioprotective effects in people with dia- betes. Many alternate pathways for platelet activation exist that are inde- pendent of thromboxane A2 and thus are not sensitive to the effects of aspirin (157). \u201cAspirin resistance\u201d has been described in people with diabetes when measured by a variety of ex vivo and in vitro methods (platelet aggregometry, measurement of thromboxane B2) (158), but other studies suggest no impairment in aspirin response among people with diabetes (159). A trial suggested that more frequent dosing regi- mens of aspirin may reduce platelet reac- tivity in individuals with diabetes (160); however, these observations alone are in- suf\ufb01cient to empirically recommend that higher doses of aspirin be used in this group at this time. Another meta-analysis raised the hypothesis that low-dose aspi- rin ef\ufb01cacy is reduced in those weighing >70 kg (161); however, the ASCEND trial found bene\ufb01t of low-dose aspirin in those in this weight range, which would thus not validate this suggested hypothesis (144). It appears that 75\u2013162 mg/day is optimal. Indications for P2Y12 Receptor Antagonist Use A P2Y12 receptor antagonist in combina- tion",

Ev- idence supports use of either ticagrelor or clopidogrel if no percutaneous coronary intervention was performed and clopidog- rel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel if a percutane- ous coronary intervention was performed (162). In people with diabetes and prior MI (1\u20133 years before), adding ticagrelor to aspirin signi\ufb01cantly reduces the risk of recurrent ischemic events including car- diovascular and CHD death (163). Simi- larly, the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin reduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascu- lar events compared with aspirin alone in people with diabetes and stable coronary artery disease (164,165). However, a higher incidence of major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, was noted with dual antiplatelet therapy. The net clinical bene\ufb01t (ischemic bene\ufb01t vs. bleeding risk) was improved with ti- cagrelor therapy in the large prespeci- \ufb01ed subgroup of patients with history of percutaneous coronary intervention, while no net bene\ufb01t was seen in pa- tients without prior percutaneous coro- nary intervention (165). However, early aspirin discontinuation compared with continued dual antiplatelet therapy af- ter coronary stenting may reduce the risk of bleeding without a corresponding increase in the risks of mortality and is- chemic events, as shown in a prespeci- \ufb01ed analysis of people with diabetes enrolled in the TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients Af- ter Coronary Intervention) trial and a re- cent meta-analysis (166,167).

In the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Us- ing Anticoagulation Strategies) trial of 27,395 individuals with established coro- nary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease, aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily was superior to aspirin plus placebo in the reduction of cardio- vascular ischemic events including major adverse limb events. The absolute bene- \ufb01ts of combination therapy appeared larger in people with diabetes, who comprised 10,341 of the trial partici- pants (168,169). A similar treatment strategy was evaluated in the Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) Along with Rivaroxaban in Endovas- cular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for Peripheral Artery Disease (VOYAGER PAD) trial (170), in which 6,564 individu- als with peripheral artery disease who had undergone revascularization were ran- domly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin. Rivaroxaban treatment in this group of patients was also associ- ated with a signi\ufb01cantly lower incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events, including major adverse limb events. However, an in- creased risk of major bleeding was noted with rivaroxaban added to aspirin treatment in both COMPASS and VOYAGER PAD. The risks and bene\ufb01ts of dual antiplate- let or antiplatelet plus anticoagulant treat- ment strategies should be thoroughly discussed with eligible patients, and shared decision-making should be used to determine an individually appropriate treatment approach.

In addition, individuals who require stress testing and are unable to exercise should undergo pharmacologic stress echocardi- ography or nuclear imaging. Screening Asymptomatic Patients The screening of asymptomatic patients with high ASCVD risk is not recom- mended (171), in part because these high-risk patients should already be re- ceiving intensive medical therapy\u2014an approach that provides bene\ufb01t similar to invasive revascularization (172,173). There is also some evidence that silent ischemia may reverse over time, adding to the controversy concerning aggres- sive screening strategies (174). In pro- spective studies, coronary artery calcium has been established as an independent predictor of future ASCVD events in peo- ple with diabetes and is consistently supe- rior to both the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine and the Fra- mingham Risk Score in predicting risk in this population (175\u2013177). However, a randomized observational trial demon- strated no clinical bene\ufb01t to routine screening of asymptomatic people with type 2 diabetes and normal ECGs (178). Despite abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging in more than one in \ufb01ve pa- tients, cardiac outcomes were essentially equal (and very low) in screened versus unscreened patients. Accordingly, indis- criminate screening is not considered cost-effective. Studies have found that a risk factor-based approach to the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent follow-up for coronary artery disease fails to identify which people with type 2 diabetes will have silent ischemia on screening tests (179,180).

Since asymptomatic people with diabetes with higher coronary disease burden have more future cardiac events (175,181,182), these additional imaging tests may pro- vide reasoning for treatment intensi\ufb01- cation and/or guide informed patient decision-making and willingness for medication initiation and participation. While coronary artery screening meth- ods, such as calcium scoring, may improve cardiovascular risk assessment in people with type 2 diabetes (183), their routine use leads to radiation exposure and may result in unnecessary invasive testing such as coronary angiography and revasculariza- tion procedures. The ultimate balance of bene\ufb01t, cost, and risks of such an ap- proach in asymptomatic patients re- mains controversial, particularly in the modern setting of aggressive ASCVD risk factor control. Lifestyle and Pharmacologic Interventions Intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on weight loss through decreased calo- ric intake and increased physical activity as performed in the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial may be considered for improving glucose con- trol, \ufb01tness, and some ASCVD risk fac- tors (184). Patients at increased ASCVD risk should receive statin, ACE inhibitor, or ARB therapy if the patient has hyper- tension, and possibly aspirin, unless there are contraindications to a particular drug class.

Glucose-Lowering Therapies and Cardiovascular Outcomes In 2008, the FDA issued a guidance for industry to perform cardiovascular out- comes trials for all new medications for the treatment for type 2 diabetes amid concerns of increased cardiovascular risk (192). Previously approved diabetes medications were not subject to the guidance. Recently published cardiovas- cular outcomes trials have provided addi- tional data on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease or at high risk for cardiovascular disease (Table 10.3A, Table 10.3B, and Table 10.3C).

In addition, the CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes) study demonstrated noninferiority between a DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, and a sulfonylurea, glimepir- ide, on cardiovascular outcomes despite lower rates of hypoglycemia in the lina- gliptin treatment group (193).

First, the Canagli\ufb02ozin Cardio- vascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Pro- gram integrated data from two trials. The CANVAS trial that started in 2009 was partially unblinded prior to completion because of the need to \ufb01le interim car- diovascular outcomes data for regulatory approval of the drug (195). Thereafter, the post approval CANVAS-Renal (CANVAS-R) trial was started in 2014. Combining both trials, 10,142 participants with type 2 dia- betes were randomized to canagli\ufb02ozin or placebo and were followed for an average 3.6 years. The mean age of patients was 63 years, and 66% had a history of cardio- vascular disease. The combined analysis of the two trials found that canagli\ufb02ozin sig- ni\ufb01cantly reduced the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke ver- sus placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 par- ticipants per 1,000 patient-years; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75\u20130.97]).

Strategies to mitigate these risks are needed, and the heart failure- related risks and bene\ufb01ts of glucose- lowering medications should be considered carefully when determining a regimen of care for people with diabetes and either established heart failure or high risk for the development of heart failure. Data on the effects of glucose-lowering agents on heart failure outcomes have demonstrated that thiazolidinediones have a strong and consistent relation- ship with increased risk of heart failure (218\u2013220). Therefore, thiazolidinedione use should be avoided in people with symptomatic heart failure. Restrictions to use of metformin in people with medically treated heart failure were re- moved by the FDA in 2006 (221). Obser- vational studies of people with type 2 diabetes and heart failure suggest that metformin users have better outcomes than individuals treated with other anti- hyperglycemic agents (222); however, no randomized trial of metformin ther- apy has been conducted in people with heart failure. Metformin may be used for the management of hyperglycemia in people with stable heart failure as long as kidney function remains within the recommended range for use (223).

More recently, the placebo-controlled DAPA-HF trial eval- uated the effects of dapagli\ufb02ozin on the primary outcome of a composite of wors- ening heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients with New York Heart Associa- tion (NYHA) class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less. Of the 4,744 trial participants, 45% had a his- tory of type 2 diabetes. Over a median of 18.2 months, the group assigned to dapa- gli\ufb02ozin treatment had a lower risk of the primary outcome (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65\u20130.85]), lower risk of \ufb01rst worsening heart failure event (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59\u20130.83]), and lower risk of cardiovascu- lar death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69\u20130.98]) compared with placebo. The effect of da- pagli\ufb02ozin on the primary outcome was consistent regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes (11). EMPEROR-Reduced assessed the effects of empagli\ufb02ozin 10 mg once daily versus placebo on a primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure in a population of 3,730 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure and an",

The \ufb01ndings on the stud- ied end points were consistent in both tri- als of heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction and in all \ufb01ve trials combined. Collectively, these studies indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk for heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in a wide range of people with heart failure. Additional data are accumulating regard- ing the effects of SGLT inhibition in people hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure and in people with heart failure and HFpEF. As an example, the investigational SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagli\ufb02ozin has also been studied in the SOLOIST- WHF trial (228). In SOLOIST-WHF, 1,222 people with type 2 diabetes who were re- cently hospitalized for worsening heart failure were randomized to sotagli\ufb02ozin 200 mg once daily (with uptitration to 400 mg once daily if tolerated) or placebo either before or within 3 days after hospi- tal discharge. Patients were eligible if hos- pitalized for signs and symptoms of heart failure (including elevated natriuretic pep- tide levels) requiring treatment with intra- venous diuretic therapy.

Similar to SCORED, SOLOIST-WHF ended early due to a lack of funding, resulting in a change to the prespeci\ufb01ed primary end point prior to unblinding to accommo- date a lower than anticipated number of end point events. At a median follow-up of 9 months, the rate of primary end point events (the total number of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations and urgent visits for heart failure) was lower in the sotagli- \ufb02ozin group than in the placebo group (51.0 vs. 76.3; HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.52\u20130.85]; P < 0.001). No signi\ufb01cant between-group differences were found in the rates of cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality. Both diarrhea (6.1% vs. 3.4%) and severe hypoglycemia (1.5% vs. 0.3%) were more common with sotagli\ufb02ozin than with placebo. The trial was originally also intended to evaluate the effects of SGLT inhibition in people with HFpEF, and ultimately no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect by ejection fraction was noted. However, the relatively small percent- age of such patients enrolled (only 21% of participants had ejection fraction >50%) and the early termination of the trial limited the ability to determine the effects of sotagli\ufb02ozin in HFpEF speci\ufb01cally. In addition to the hospitalization and mortality bene\ufb01t in people with heart fail- ure, several recent analyses have ad- dressed whether SGLT2 inhibitor treatment improves clinical stability and functional status in individuals with heart failure.

In addition, patients treated with empagli\ufb02ozin were more likely to experi- ence an improvement in NYHA functional class (229). In people hospitalized for acute de novo or decompensated chronic heart failure, initiation of empagli\ufb02ozin treatment during hospitalization reduced the primary outcome of a composite of death from any cause, number of heart failure events and time to \ufb01rst heart failure event, or a 5-point or greater difference in change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomy- opathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score (230). Furthermore, PRESERVED-HF, a mul- ticenter study (26 sites in the U.S.) showed that dapagli\ufb02ozin treatment leads to signi\ufb01- cant improvement in both symptoms and physical limitation, as well as objective measures of exercise function in people with chronic HFpEF, regardless of diabetes status (198). Finally, canagli\ufb02ozin improved heart failure symptoms assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Ques- tionnaire Total Symptom Score, irrespec- tive of left ventricular ejection fraction or the presence of diabetes (231). Therefore, in people with type 2 diabetes and estab- lished HFpEF or HFrEF, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven bene\ufb01t in this patient popu- lation is recommended to reduce the risk of worsening heart failure and cardiovas- cular death.

Finerenone, a selective non- steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist, has been shown in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) trial to improve CKD outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes with stage 3 or 4 CKD and severe albumin- uria (233).

Clinical Approach As has been carefully outlined in Fig. 9.3 in the preceding Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d peo- ple with type 2 diabetes with or at high risk for ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD should be treated with a cardioprotective SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 receptor ago- nist as part of the comprehensive ap- proach to cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction. Importantly, these agents should be included in the regimen of care irrespective of the need for additional glucose lowering, and irrespective of metformin use. Such an approach has also been described in the American Di- abetes Association\u2013endorsed American College of Cardiology \u201c2020 Expert Con- sensus Decision Pathway on Novel Therapies for Cardiovascular Risk Re- duction in Patients With Type 2 Dia- betes\u201d (234). Figure 10.3, reproduced from that decision pathway, outlines the approach to risk reduction with SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor ago- nist therapy in conjunction with other traditional, guideline-based preventive medical therapies for blood pressure, lipids, and glycemia and antiplatelet therapy. Adoption of these agents should be reasonably straightforward in people with established cardiovascular or kidney dis- ease who are later diagnosed with dia- betes, as the cardioprotective agents can be used from the outset of diabetes management. On the other hand, incor- poration of SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 re- ceptor agonist therapy in the care of individuals with more long-standing dia- betes may",

Diabetic kidney disease typically develops after a diabetes dura- tion of 10 years in type 1 diabetes (the most common presentation is 5\u201315 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes) but may be present at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. CKD can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation and is the leading cause of ESRD in the U.S. (6). In addition, among people with type 1 or type 2 dia- betes, the presence of CKD markedly in- creases cardiovascular risk and health care costs (7). For details on the manage- ment of diabetic kidney disease in chil- dren, please see section 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents.\u201d ASSESSMENT OF ALBUMINURIA AND ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urinary albumin- to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection (1,2). Timed or 24-h col- lections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measure- ment of a spot urine sample for albumin alone (whether by immunoassay or by using a sensitive dipstick test speci\ufb01c for albuminuria) without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine is less ex- pensive but susceptible to false-negative and false-positive determinations as a re- sult of variation in urine concentration due to hydration (8). Thus, to be useful for patient screening, semiquantita- tive or qualitative (dipstick) screening tests should be",

Hence, it is better to simply collect a spot urine sample for albumin-to-creatinine ratio because it will ultimately need to be done. Normal albuminuria is de\ufb01ned as <30 mg/g creatinine, moderately elevated albuminuria is de\ufb01ned as $30\u2013300 mg/g creatinine, and severely elevated albu- minuria is de\ufb01ned as $300 mg/g creati- nine. However, UACR is a continuous measurement, and differences within the normal and abnormal ranges are associated with renal and cardiovascular outcomes (7,11,12). Furthermore, be- cause of high biological variability of >20% between measurements in uri- nary albumin excretion, two of three specimens of UACR collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have moderately or severely elevated albu- minuria (1,2,13,14). Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage (15). Traditionally, eGFR is calculated from serum creatinine using a validated formula (16). The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemi- ology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation is preferred (2). eGFR is routinely reported by laboratories along with serum creati- nine, and eGFR calculators are available online at nkdep.nih.gov. An eGFR persis- tently <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in concert with a urinary albumin value of >30 mg/g creatinine is considered abnormal, though optimal thresholds for clinical diagnosis are debated in older adults over age 70 years (2,17).

Thus, it was decided that the equa- tion should be altered such that it applies to all (16). Hence, a committee was con- vened, resulting in the recommendation for immediate implementation of the CKD-EPI creatinine equation re\ufb01t without the race variable in all laboratories in the U.S. Additionally, increased use of cystatin C (another marker of eGFR) is suggested in combination with the serum creatinine be- cause combining \ufb01ltration markers (creati- nine and cystatin C) is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone. DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE Diabetic kidney disease is usually a clini- cal diagnosis made based on the pres- ence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symp- toms of other primary causes of kidney damage. The typical presentation of diabetic kidney disease is considered to include a long-standing duration of dia- betes, retinopathy, albuminuria without gross hematuria, and gradually progres- sive loss of eGFR.

    "text": "diabetic kidney disease may be present at diagnosis or without retinopathy in type 2 diabetes. Reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been frequently re- ported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time as the prevalence of diabetes in- creases in the U.S. (3,4,18,19). An active urinary sediment (containing red or white blood cells or cellular casts), rapidly increasing albuminuria or total proteinuria, the presence of nephrotic syndrome, rapidly decreasing eGFR, or the absence of retinopathy (in type 1 di- abetes) suggests alternative or additional causes of kidney disease. For patients with these features, referral to a ne- phrologist for further diagnosis, including the possibility of kidney biopsy, should be considered. It is rare for people with type 1 diabetes to develop kidney dis- ease without retinopathy. In type 2 dia- betes, retinopathy is only moderately sensitive and speci\ufb01c for CKD caused by diabetes, as con\ufb01rmed by kidney biopsy (20). STAGING OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Stage 1 and stage 2 CKD are de\ufb01ned by evidence of high albuminuria with eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and stages 3\u20135 CKD are de\ufb01ned by progressively lower ranges of eGFR (21) (Fig. 11.1). At any eGFR, the degree of albuminuria is asso- ciated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD progression, and mortality (7). Therefore, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends a more comprehensive CKD staging that incorporates albuminuria at all stages of eGFR; this system is more closely associ- ated with risk but is also more complex and",

Thus, based on the current classi\ufb01cation system, both eGFR and albuminuria must be quanti\ufb01ed to guide treatment decisions. This is also im- portant because eGFR levels are essential for modi\ufb01cations of drug dosages or re- strictions of use (Fig. 11.1) (22,23). The degree of albuminuria should in\ufb02uence the choice of antihypertensive medica- tions (see Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\u201d) or gluco- se-lowering medications (see below). Ob- served history of eGFR loss (which is also associated with risk of CKD progression and other adverse health outcomes) and cause of kidney damage (including possible causes other than diabetes) may also affect these decisions (24). ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY Acute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed by a 50% or greater sustained increase in se- rum creatinine over a short period of time, which is also re\ufb02ected as a rapid decrease in eGFR (25,26). People with di- abetes are at higher risk of AKI than those without diabetes (27). Other risk factors for AKI include preexisting CKD, the use of medications that cause kidney injury (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs), and the use of medications that alter renal blood \ufb02ow and intrarenal he- modynamics. In particular, many antihy- pertensive medications (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) can reduce intravascular volume, renal blood \ufb02ow, and/or glo- merular \ufb01ltration. There was concern that sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may promote AKI through volume depletion, particularly when combined with diuretics or other medications that reduce",

It is also note- worthy that the nonsteroidal mineralocor- ticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) do not increase the risk of AKI when used to slow kidney disease progression (32). Timely identi\ufb01cation and treatment of AKI is important because AKI is associated with increased risks of progressive CKD and other poor health outcomes (33). Elevations in serum creatinine (up to 30% from baseline) with renin-angioten- sin system (RAS) blockers (such as ACE in- hibitors and ARBs) must not be confused with AKI (34). An analysis of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure (ACCORD BP) trial demon- strates that participants randomized to in- tensive blood pressure lowering with up to a 30% increase in serum creatinine did not have any increase in mortality or pro- gressive kidney disease (35\u201338). More- over, a measure of markers for AKI showed no signi\ufb01cant increase of any markers with increased creatinine (37). Accordingly, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued for increases in serum creatinine (<30%) in the ab- sence of volume depletion. Lastly, it should be noted that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly not dosed at maximum tolerated doses because of fear that serum creatinine will rise. As noted above, this is an error.

Moreover, there are now studies demonstrating outcome bene\ufb01ts on both mortality and slowed CKD progression in people with diabetes who have an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (38). Addition- ally, when increases in serum creati- nine reach 30% without associated hyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be continued (36,39). SURVEILLANCE Both albuminuria and eGFR should be monitored annually to enable timely di- agnosis of CKD, monitor progression of CKD, detect superimposed kidney dis- eases including AKI, assess risk of CKD complications, dose drugs appropriately, and determine whether nephrology re- ferral is needed. Among people with ex- isting kidney disease, albuminuria and eGFR may change due to progression of CKD, development of a separate super- imposed cause of kidney disease, AKI, or other effects of medications, as noted above. Serum potassium should also be monitored in patients treated with diuretics because these medica- tions can cause hypokalemia, which is associated with cardiovascular risk and mortality (40\u201342). Patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving ACE in- hibitors, ARBs, or MRAs should have se- rum potassium measured periodically. Additionally, people with this lower range of eGFR should have their medi- cation dosing veri\ufb01ed, their exposure to nephrotoxins (e.g., nonsteroidal anti- in\ufb02ammatory drugs and iodinated con- trast) should be minimized, and they should be evaluated for potential CKD complications (Table 11.1).

Contin- ued surveillance can assess both response to therapy and disease progression and may aid in assessing participation in ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. In addition, in clinical trials of ACE inhibitors or ARB therapy in type 2 diabetes, reducing albu- minuria to levels <300 mg/g creatinine or by >30% from baseline has been asso- ciated with improved renal and cardiovas- cular outcomes, leading some to suggest that medications should be titrated to maximize reduction in UACR. Data from post hoc analyses demonstrate less ben- e\ufb01t on cardiorenal outcomes at half doses of RAS blockade (44). In type 1 di- abetes, remission of albuminuria may occur spontaneously, and cohort studies evaluating associations of change in al- buminuria with clinical outcomes have reported inconsistent results (45,46). The prevalence of CKD complications correlates with eGFR (42). When eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, screening for complications of CKD is indicated (Table 11.1).

Thus, the American Diabetes Association does not recommend routine use of these medications solely for the purpose of prevention of the development of di- abetic kidney disease. INTERVENTIONS Nutrition For people with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, dietary protein intake should be \u00010.8 g/kg body weight per day (the rec- ommended daily allowance) (1). Com- pared with higher levels of dietary protein intake, this level slowed GFR decline with evidence of a greater effect over time. Higher levels of dietary protein intake (>20% of daily calories from protein or >1.3 g/kg/day) have been associated with increased albuminuria, more rapid kidney function loss, and CVD mortality and therefore should be avoided. Reduc- ing the amount of dietary protein below the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g/kg/day is not recommended be- cause it does not alter blood glucose levels, cardiovascular risk measures, or the course of GFR decline (47). Restriction of dietary sodium (to <2,300 mg/day) may be useful to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk (48,49), and individualization of die- tary potassium may be necessary to con- trol serum potassium concentrations (27,40\u201342). These interventions may be most important for individuals with reduced eGFR, for whom urinary excre- tion of sodium and potassium may be impaired. For patients on dialysis, higher levels of dietary protein intake should be considered since malnutrition is a major problem for",

Glycemic Targets Intensive lowering of blood glucose with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large randomized studies to delay the onset and pro- gression of albuminuria and reduce eGFR in people with type 1 diabetes (51,52) and type 2 diabetes (1,53\u201358). Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complica- tions (EDIC) study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type 2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lower- ing blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering therapies on CKD have helped de\ufb01ne A1C targets (see Table 6.2). The presence of CKD affects the risks and bene\ufb01ts of intensive lowering of blood glucose and a number of speci\ufb01c glucose-lowering medications. In the Ac- tion to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Dia- betes (ACCORD) trial of type 2 diabetes, adverse effects of intensive management of blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia and mortality) were increased among people with kidney disease at baseline (59,60). Moreover, there is a lag time of at least 2 years in type 2 diabetes to over 10 years in type 1 diabetes for the effects of intensive glucose control to manifest as improved eGFR outcomes (56,60,61).

Indeed, all the trials that evaluated the bene\ufb01ts of SGLT2 in- hibition or nonsteroidal mineralocorti- coid receptor antagonist effects were done in individuals who were being treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, in some trials up to maximum tolerated doses. Hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development and progression of CKD (63). Antihypertensive ther- apy reduces the risk of albuminuria (64\u201367), and among people with type 1 or 2 diabetes with established CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR $300 mg/g creatinine), ACE in- hibitor or ARB therapy reduces the risk of progression to ESRD (68\u201370,74\u201380). Moreover, antihypertensive therapy re- duces the risk of cardiovascular events (64). A blood pressure level <130/80 mmHg is recommended to reduce CVD mortality and slow CKD progression among all people with diabetes. Lower blood pres- sure targets (e.g., <130/80 mmHg) should be considered for patients based on individual anticipated bene\ufb01ts and risks. People with CKD are at increased risk of CKD progression (particularly those with albuminuria) and CVD; there- fore, lower blood pressure targets may be suitable in some cases, especially in individuals with severely elevated albu- minuria ($300 mg/g creatinine).

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are considered to have similar bene\ufb01ts (75,76) and risks. In the setting of lower levels of albuminuria (30\u2013299 mg/g creatinine), ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy at maximum tolerated doses in trials has reduced progression to more advanced albuminuria ($300 mg/g creatinine), slowed CKD progression, and reduced car- diovascular events but has not reduced progression to ESRD (74,77). While ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed for moderately increased albuminuria with- out hypertension, outcome trials have not been performed in this setting to determine whether they improve renal outcomes. Moreover, two long-term, dou- ble-blind studies demonstrated no reno- protective effect of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes among those who were normotensive with or without high albuminuria (for- merly microalbuminuria) (78,79). Absent kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are useful to manage blood pressure but have not proven superior to alternative classes of antihypertensive therapy, including thiazide-like diuretics and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (80). In a trial of people with type 2 diabetes and normal urinary albu- min excretion, an ARB reduced or sup- pressed the development of albuminuria but increased the rate of cardiovascular events (81). In a trial of people with type 1 diabetes exhibiting neither albu- minuria nor hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not prevent the development of diabetic glomerulopathy assessed by kidney biopsy (78).

Two clinical trials studied the combina- tions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and found no bene\ufb01ts on CVD or CKD, and the drug combination had higher adverse event rates (hyperkalemia and/or AKI) (82,83). Therefore, the combined use of ACE inhibi- tors and ARBs should be avoided. Direct Renal Effects of Glucose- Lowering Medications Some glucose-lowering medications also have effects on the kidney that are di- rect, i.e., not mediated through glycemia. For example, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce re- nal tubular glucose reabsorption, weight, systemic blood pressure, intraglomerular pressure, and albuminuria and slow GFR loss through mechanisms that appear in- dependent of glycemia (30,84\u201387). More- over, recent data support the notion that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce oxidative stress in the kidney by >50% and blunt in- creases in angiotensinogen as well as reduce NLRP3 in\ufb02ammasome activity (88\u201390). Glucagon-like peptide 1 recep- tor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) also have direct effects on the kidney and have been reported to improve renal outcomes compared with placebo (91\u201395). Renal effects should be considered when selecting antihyperglycemia agents (see Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\u201d). Selection of Glucose-Lowering Medications for People With Chronic Kidney Disease For people with type 2 diabetes and es- tablished CKD, special considerations for the selection of glucose-lowering medica- tions include limitations to available med- ications when eGFR is diminished and a desire to mitigate risks of CKD progres- sion, CVD, and hypoglycemia (96,97).

The revised FDA guidance states that 1) metformin is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, 2) eGFR should be monitored while taking metformin, 3) the bene\ufb01ts and risks of continuing treatment should be reassessed when eGFR falls to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (99,100), 4) metformin should not be initiated for patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5) metformin should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imaging procedures in patients with eGFR 30\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2. A number of recent studies have shown cardiovascular protection from SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs as well as renal protection from SGLT2 in- hibitors and possibly from GLP-1 RAs. Selection of which glucose-lowering medi- cations to use should be based on the usual criteria of an individual patient\u2019s risks (cardiovascular and renal in addition to glucose control) as well as convenience and cost. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with stage 3 CKD or higher and type 2 diabetes, as they slow CKD progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose manage- ment (101).

For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, the selection of speci\ufb01c agents may depend on comorbidity and CKD stage. SGLT2 inhibitors may be more useful for individuals at high risk of CKD progres- sion (i.e., with albuminuria or a history of documented eGFR loss) (Fig. 9.3) due to an apparent large bene\ufb01cial effect on CKD incidence. However, for people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney dis- ease, use of an SGLT2 inhibitor in individ- uals with eGFR $20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR $200 mg/g creatinine is rec- ommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. This is a change in eGFR from previous recom- mendations that suggested an eGFR level >25 mL/min/1.73 m2.The reason for the lower limit of eGFR is as follows.The ma- jor clinical trials for SGLT2 inhibitors that showed bene\ufb01t for people with dia- betic kidney disease are CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD (28,105). CREDENCE enrollment criteria included an eGFR >30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 and UACR >300 mg/g (28,105). DAPA-CKD enrolled individuals with eGFR >25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR >200 mg/g.

Hence, the new recommendation is to use SGLT2 inhibitors in individuals with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. In addition, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial sug- gested effectiveness in participants with normal urinary albumin levels (112). In sum, for people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease, use of an SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events in people with an eGFR $20 mL/min/ 1.73 m2. Of note, GLP-1 RAs may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment (113). Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes of Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists in Chronic Kidney Disease MRAs historically have not been well studied in diabetic kidney disease because of the risk of hyperkalemia (114,115).

How- ever, the study was completed, and there were no deaths related to hy- perkalemia. Of note, 4.5% of the total group were being treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. The Finerenone in Reducing Cardio- vascular Mortality and Morbidity in Di- abetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial assessed the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of \ufb01nerenone in reducing cardiovascular events among people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with elevated UACR (30 to <300 mg/g creatinine) and eGFR 25\u201390 mL/min/1.73 m2 (118). The study randomized eligible subjects to either \ufb01- nerenone (n 5 3,686) or placebo (n 5 3,666). Participants with an eGFR of 25\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the screening visit received an initial dose at baseline of 10 mg once daily, and if eGFR at screening was $60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the initial dose was 20 mg once daily. An increase in the dose from 10 to 20 mg once daily was encouraged after 1 month, provided the serum potassium level was #4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was stable. The mean age of participants was 64.1 years (31% were female), and the median follow- up duration was 3.4 years.The median A1C was 7.7%, the mean systolic blood pres- sure was 136 mmHg, and the mean GFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m2. People with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. The primary composite outcome was",

This bene\ufb01t was primarily driven by a reduction in heart failure hos- pitalizations: 3.2% vs. 4.4% in the placebo group (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56\u20130.90]).

There was a higher inci- dence of hyperkalemia in the \ufb01nerenone group, 10.8% vs. 5.3%, although only 1.2% of the 3,686 individuals on \ufb01nerenone stopped the study due to hyperkalemia (0.6% vs. 0.4% of the placebo group). The FIDELITY prespeci\ufb01ed pooled ef\ufb01- cacy and safety analysis incorporated individuals from both the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD trials (N 5 13,171) to allow for evaluation across the spec- trum of severity of CKD, since the popu- lations were different (with a slight overlap) and the study designs were similar (119). The analysis showed a 14% reduction in composite cardiovascu- lar death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure for \ufb01nerenone vs. placebo (12.7% vs. 14.4%; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78\u20130.95]; P 5 0.0018). It also demonstrated a 23% reduction in the composite kidney outcome, consist- ing of sustained $57% decrease in eGFR from baseline over $4 weeks, or renal death, for \ufb01nerenone vs. placebo (5.5% vs. 7.1%; HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67\u20130.88]; P 5 0.0002). The pooled FIDELITY trial analysis con\ufb01rms and strengthens the positive car- diovascular and renal outcomes with \ufb01- nerenone across the spectrum of CKD, irrespective of baseline ASCVD history (with the exclusion of those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction).

The threshold for referral may vary depending on the fre- quency with which a health care profes- sional encounters people with diabetes and kidney disease. Consultation with a nephrologist when stage 4 CKD develops (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been found to reduce cost, improve quality of care, and delay dialysis (120). However, other specialists and health care professio- nals should also educate their patients about the progressive nature of CKD, the kidney preservation bene\ufb01ts of proactive treatment of blood pressure and blood glucose, and the potential need for renal replacement therapy.

A Diabetic retinopathy is a highly speci\ufb01c vascular complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with prevalence strongly related to both the duration of diabetes and the level of glycemic control (1). Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of new cases of blindness among adults aged 20\u201374 years in developed countries. Glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders occur earlier and more frequently in people with diabetes. In addition to diabetes duration, factors that increase the risk of, or are associ- ated with, retinopathy include chronic hyperglycemia (2,3), nephropathy (4), hyper- tension (5), and dyslipidemia (6). Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to prevent and/or delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy, reduce the need for future ocular surgical procedures, and potentially improve patient-reported visual function (2,7\u201310). A meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcomes studies showed no association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment and retinopathy per se, except through the association between retinopathy and average A1C reduction at the 3-month and 1-year follow- up.

B 12.8 Individuals with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes should receive an eye exam before pregnancy and in the \ufb01rst trimester and should be moni- tored every trimester and for 1 year postpartum as indicated by the degree of retinopathy. B The preventive effects of therapy and the fact that individuals with prolifera- tive diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or macu- lar edema may be asymptomatic provide strong support for screening to detect diabetic retinopathy. Prompt diagnosis allows triage of patients and timely in- tervention that may prevent vision loss in individuals who are asymptomatic despite advanced diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy screening should be performed using validated approaches and methodologies. Youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are also at risk for compli- cations and need to be screened for dia- betic retinopathy (12) (see Section 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents\u201d). If diabetic retinopathy is evident on screening, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is recom- mended. Subsequent examinations for individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabe- tes are generally repeated annually for individuals with minimal to no retinop- athy. Exams every 1\u20132 years may be cost-effective after one or more normal eye exams. In a population with well- controlled type 2 diabetes, there was little risk of development of signi\ufb01cant retinopathy within a 3-year interval af- ter a normal examination (13), and less frequent intervals have been found in simulated modeling to be potentially ef- fective in screening for diabetic retinop- athy in",

However, it is impor- tant to adjust screening intervals based on the presence of speci\ufb01c risk factors for retinopathy onset and worsening retinopathy. More frequent examina- tions by the ophthalmologist will be re- quired if retinopathy is progressing or risk factors such as uncontrolled hyperglyce- mia, advanced baseline retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema are present. Retinal photography with remote read- ing by experts has great potential to pro- vide screening services in areas where quali\ufb01ed eye care professionals are not readily available (15\u201317). High-quality fun- dus photographs can detect most clinically signi\ufb01cant diabetic retinopathy. Interpreta- tion of the images should be performed by a trained eye care professional. Retinal photography may also enhance ef\ufb01ciency and reduce costs when the expertise of ophthalmologists can be used for more complex examinations and for therapy (15,18,19). In-person exams are still nec- essary when the retinal photos are of unacceptable quality and for follow-up if abnormalities are detected. Retinal pho- tos are not a substitute for dilated com- prehensive eye exams, which should be performed at least initially and at yearly intervals thereafter or more frequently as recommended by an eye care profes- sional. Arti\ufb01cial intelligence systems that detect more than mild diabetic retinopa- thy and diabetic macular edema, autho- rized for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), represent an alter- native to traditional screening approaches (20).

Type 2 Diabetes People with type 2 diabetes who may have had years of undiagnosed diabetes and have a signi\ufb01cant risk of prevalent diabetic retinopathy at the time of diag- nosis should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination at the time of diagnosis.

The pooled progression rate per 100 pregnancies for new diabetic reti- nopathy development was 15.0 (95% CI 9.9\u201320.8), worsened nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was 31.0 (95% CI 23.2\u201339.2), pooled sight-threatening pro- gression rate from nonproliferative dia- betic retinopathy to PDR was 6.3 (95% CI 3.3\u201310.0), and worsened PDR was 37.0 (95% CI 21.2\u201354.0), demonstrating that close follow-up should be maintained during pregnancy to prevent vision loss (23). In addition, rapid implementation of intensive glycemic management in the setting of retinopathy is associ- ated with early worsening of retinop- athy (24). A systematic review and meta-analysis and a controlled prospective study dem- onstrate that pregnancy in individuals with type 1 diabetes may aggravate reti- nopathy and threaten vision, especially when glycemic control is poor or retinop- athy severity is advanced at the time of conception (23,24). Laser photocoagu- lation surgery can minimize the risk of vision loss during pregnancy for individ- uals with high-risk PDR or center-involved diabetic macular edema (24). Anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) med- ications should not be used in pregnant individuals with diabetes because of the- oretical risks to the vasculature of the developing fetus.

A 12.10 Panretinal laser photocoagu- lation therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of vision loss in individuals with high-risk proliferative diabetic retinop- athy and, in some cases, se- vere nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. A 12.11 Intravitreous injections of anti\u2013 vascular endothelial growth factor are a reasonable alter- native to traditional panretinal laser photocoagulation for some individuals with prolifer- ative diabetic retinopathy and also reduce the risk of vision loss in these individuals. A 12.12 Intravitreous injections of anti\u2013 vascular endothelial growth factor are indicated as \ufb01rst- line treatment for most eyes with diabetic macular edema that involves the foveal center and impairs vision acuity. A 12.13 Macular focal/grid photo- coagulation and intravitreal injections of corticosteroid are reasonable treatments in eyes with persistent diabetic macu- lar edema despite previous anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor therapy or eyes that are not candidates for this \ufb01rst-line approach. A 12.14 The presence of retinopathy is not a contraindication to aspirin therapy for cardiopro- tection, as aspirin does not increase the risk of retinal hemorrhage. A Two of the main motivations for screen- ing for diabetic retinopathy are to pre- vent loss of vision and to intervene with treatment when vision loss can be pre- vented or reversed. Photocoagulation Surgery Two large trials, the Diabetic Retinopa- thy Study (DRS) in individuals with PDR and the Early Treatment Diabetic Reti- nopathy Study (ETDRS) in individuals with macular edema, provide the strongest support for the therapeutic bene\ufb01ts of photocoagulation surgery.

In 1985, the ETDRS also veri\ufb01ed the bene\ufb01ts of panretinal photocoagulation for high-risk PDR and in older-onset individuals with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or less-than-high-risk PDR. Panretinal laser photocoagulation is still commonly used to manage complications of dia- betic retinopathy that involve retinal neovascularization and its complications. A more gentle, macular focal/grid laser photocoagulation technique was shown in the ETDRS to be effective in treating eyes with clinically signi\ufb01cant macular edema from diabetes (26), but this is now largely considered to be second-line treatment for diabetic macular edema. Anti\u2013Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Treatment Data from the DRCR Retina Network (formerly the Diabetic Retinopathy Clini- cal Research Network) and others dem- onstrate that intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents are effective at re- gressing proliferative disease and lead to noninferior or superior visual acuity outcomes compared with panretinal la- ser over 2 years of follow-up (27,28). In addition, it was observed that individuals treated with ranibizumab tended to have less peripheral visual \ufb01eld loss, fewer vitrectomy surgeries for secondary com- plications from their proliferative dis- ease, and a lower risk of developing diabetic macular edema. However, a potential drawback in using anti-VEGF therapy to manage proliferative disease is that patients were required to have a",

Other emerging therapies for retinopathy that may use sustained intravitreal delivery of pharmacologic agents are currently under investigation. Anti-VEGF treatment of eyes with non- proliferative diabetic retinopathy has been demonstrated to reduce subse- quent development of retinal neovascu- larization and diabetic macular edema but has not been shown to improve visual outcomes over 2 years of therapy and therefore is not routinely recom- mended for this indication (29).

Most patients require near-monthly adminis- tration of intravitreal therapy with anti- VEGF agents during the \ufb01rst 12 months of treatment, with fewer injections needed in subsequent years to maintain remission from central-involved diabetic macular edema. There are currently three anti- VEGF agents commonly used to treat eyes with central-involved diabetic macular edema\u2014bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and a\ufb02ibercept (1)\u2014and a comparative effec- tiveness study demonstrated that a\ufb02iber- cept provides vision outcomes superior to those of bevacizumab when eyes have moderate visual impairment (vision of 20/50 or worse) from diabetic macular edema (32). For eyes that have good vision (20/25 or better) despite diabetic macular edema, close monitoring with initiation of anti-VEGF therapy if vision worsens provides similar 2-year vision outcomes compared with immediate initi- ation of anti-VEGF therapy (33). Eyes that have persistent diabetic macu- lar edema despite anti-VEGF treatment may bene\ufb01t from macular laser photo- coagulation or intravitreal therapy with corticosteroids. Both of these therapies are also reasonable \ufb01rst-line approaches for individuals who are not candidates for anti-VEGF treatment due to systemic considerations such as pregnancy.

Major clinical manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy include resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypoten- sion, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, and sudomotor dysfunction with either increased or decreased sweating. Screening for symp- toms of autonomic neuropathy includes asking about symptoms of orthostatic in- tolerance (dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness with standing), syncope, exer- cise intolerance, constipation, diarrhea, urinary retention, urinary incontinence, or changes in sweat function. Further testing can be considered if symptoms are present and will depend on the end organ involved but might include cardio- vascular autonomic testing, sweat testing, urodynamic studies, gastric emptying, or endoscopy/colonoscopy.

In its early stages, CAN may be completely asymptomatic and detected only by decreased heart rate variability with deep breathing. Advanced disease may be associated with resting tachycardia (>100 bpm) and orthostatic hypoten- sion (a fall in systolic or diastolic blood pressure by >20 mmHg or >10 mmHg, respectively, upon standing without an appropriate increase in heart rate). CAN treatment is generally focused on allevi- ating symptoms. Gastrointestinal Neuropathies. Gastrointes- tinal neuropathies may involve any por- tion of the gastrointestinal tract, with manifestations including esophageal dysmotility, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. Gastro- paresis should be suspected in individu- als with erratic glycemic control or with upper gastrointestinal symptoms with- out another identi\ufb01ed cause.

The diagnostic gold standard for gastroparesis is the measurement of gastric emptying with scintigraphy of digestible solids at 15-min intervals for 4 h after food intake. The use of 13C octanoic acid breath test is an ap- proved alternative. Genitourinary Disturbances.

Blood Pressure Control There are multiple reasons for blood pressure control in people with diabetes, but neuropathy progression (especially in type 2 diabetes) has now been added to this list.

The American Academy of Neurology update suggested that gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibi- tors (SNRIs), sodium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and SNRI/ opioid dual-mechanism agents could all be considered in the treatment of pain in DPN (60). These American Academy of Neurology recommendations offer a sup- plement to a recent American Diabetes Association pain monograph, although some areas of disagreement exist, particu- larly around SNRI/opioid dual-mechanism agents (61). A recent head-to-head trial suggested therapeutic equivalency for TCAs, SNRIs, and gabapentinoids in the treatment of pain in DPN (62). The trial also supported the role of combination therapy over monotherapy for the treat- ment of pain in DPN. Gabapentinoids. Gabapentinoids include several calcium channel a2-d subunit li- gands. Eight high-quality studies and seven medium-quality studies support the role of pregabalin in treatment of pain in DPN.

Tapentadol and tramadol are centrally acting opioid anal- gesics that exert their analgesic effects through both m-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition. SNRI/opioid agents are probably effective in the treatment of pain in DPN. However, the use of any opioids for man- agement of chronic neuropathic pain carries the risk of addiction and should be avoided. Tricyclic Antidepressants.

Carba- mazepine and a-lipoic acid, although not approved for the treatment of painful DPN, may be effective and considered for the treatment of painful DPN (41,54,56). Orthostatic Hypotension Treating orthostatic hypotension is chal- lenging. The therapeutic goal is to mini- mize postural symptoms rather than to restore normotension. Most patients re- quire both nonpharmacologic measures (e.g., ensuring adequate salt intake, avoid- ing medications that aggravate hypoten- sion, or using compressive garments over the legs and abdomen) and pharmaco- logic measures. Physical activity and ex- ercise should be encouraged to avoid deconditioning, which is known to ex- acerbate orthostatic intolerance, and volume repletion with \ufb02uids and salt is critical. There have been clinical studies that assessed the impact of an approach incorporating the aforementioned non- pharmacologic measures. Additionally, supine blood pressure tends to be much higher in these individuals, often requir- ing treatment of blood pressure at bed- time with shorter-acting drugs that also affect baroreceptor activity such as guan- facine or clonidine, shorter-acting calcium blockers (e.g., isradipine), or shorter- acting b-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol tartrate.

However, the level of evidence regarding the bene\ufb01ts of meto- clopramide for the management of gas- troparesis is weak, and given the risk for serious adverse effects (extrapyramidal signs such as acute dystonic reactions, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia), its use in the treat- ment of gastroparesis beyond 12 weeks is no longer recommended by the FDA.

    "text": "Identifying the at-risk foot begins with a detailed history documenting diabetes control, smoking history, exercise toler- ance, history of claudication or rest pain, and prior ulcerations or amputations. A thorough examination of the feet should be performed annually in all people with diabetes and more frequently in at-risk individuals (75). The examination should include assessment of skin integrity, as- sessment for LOPS using the 10-g mono- \ufb01lament along with at least one other neurological assessment tool, pulse ex- amination of the dorsalis pedis and pos- terior tibial arteries, and assessment for foot deformities such as bunions, ham- mertoes, and prominent metatarsals, which increase plantar foot pressures and increase risk for ulcerations. At-risk individuals should be assessed at each visit and should be referred to foot care specialists for ongoing preventive care and surveillance. The physical examina- tion can stratify patients into different categories and determine the frequency of these visits (76) (Table 12.1). Evaluation for Loss of Protective Sensation The presence of peripheral sensory neu- ropathy is the single most common com- ponent cause for foot ulceration. In a multicenter trial, peripheral neuropathy was found to be a component cause in 78% of people with diabetes with ulcer- ations and that the triad of peripheral sensory neuropathy, minor trauma, and foot deformity was present in >63% of participants (77). All people with dia- betes should undergo a comprehensive foot examination at least annually, or more frequently for those in higher-risk categories (75,76). LOPS is vital to risk assessment.

    "text": "the most useful tests to determine LOPS is the 10-g mono\ufb01lament test. Studies have shown that clinical exami- nation and the 10-g mono\ufb01lament test are the two most sensitive tests in iden- tifying the foot at risk for ulceration (78). The mono\ufb01lament test should be performed with at least one other neu- rologic assessment tool (e.g., pinprick, temperature perception, ankle re\ufb02exes, or vibratory perception with a 128-Hz tuning fork or similar device). Absent mono\ufb01lament sensation and one other abnormal test con\ufb01rms the presence of LOPS. Further neurological testing, such as nerve conduction, electromyography, nerve biopsy, or intraepidermal nerve \ufb01- ber density biopsies, are rarely indicated for the diagnosis of peripheral sensory neuropathy (42). Evaluation for Peripheral Arterial Disease Initial screening for PAD should include a history of leg fatigue, claudication, and rest pain relieved with dependency. Physical examination for PAD should include assessment of lower-extremity pulses, capillary re\ufb01ll time, rubor on dependency, pallor on elevation, and ve- nous \ufb01lling time (75,79). Any patient ex- hibiting signs and symptoms of PAD should be referred for noninvasive arte- rial studies in the form of Doppler ultra- sound with pulse volume recordings. While ankle\u2013brachial indices will be calculated, they should be interpreted carefully, as they are known to be inac- curate in people with diabetes due to noncompressible vessels. Toe systolic blood pressure tends to be more accurate. Toe systolic blood pressures <30 mmHg are suggestive of PAD and an inability to heal foot ulcerations (80). Individuals with abnormal pulse volume recording tracings",

Due to the high prevalence of PAD in people with dia- betes, it has been recommended by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Podiatric Medical Associa- tion in their 2016 guidelines that all people with diabetes >50 years of age should undergo screening via noninva- sive arterial studies (79,81). If nor- mal, these should be repeated every 5 years (79). Patient Education All people with diabetes (and their families), particularly those with the aforementioned high-risk conditions, should receive general foot care edu- cation, including appropriate manage- ment strategies (82\u201384). This education should be provided to all newly diag- nosed people with diabetes as part of an annual comprehensive examination and to individuals with high-risk conditions at every visit. Recent studies have shown that while education improves knowl- edge of diabetic foot problems and self- care of the foot, it does not improve behaviors associated with active participa- tion in their overall diabetes care and to achieve personal health goals (85). Evi- dence also suggests that while patient and family education are important, the knowledge is quickly forgotten and needs to be reinforced regularly (86).

    "text": "Individuals considered at risk should understand the implications of foot de- formities, LOPS, and PAD; the proper care of the foot, including nail and skin care; and the importance of foot inspec- tions on a daily basis. Individuals with LOPS should be educated on appropriate ways to examine their feet (palpation or visual inspection with an unbreakable mirror) for daily surveillance of early foot problems. Patients should also be educated on the importance of refer- rals to foot care specialists. A recent study showed that people with diabetes and foot disease lacked awareness of their risk status and why they were be- ing referred to a multidisciplinary team of foot care specialists. Further, they ex- hibited a variable degree of interest in learning further about foot complica- tions (87). Patients\u2019 understanding of these issues and their physical ability to conduct proper foot surveillance and care should be as- sessed. Those with visual dif\ufb01culties, physi- cal constraints preventing movement, or cognitive problems that impair their ability to assess the condition of the foot and to institute appropriate responses will need other people, such as family members, to assist with their care. The selection of appropriate footwear and footwear behaviors at home should also be discussed (e.g., no walking barefoot, avoiding open-toed shoes). Therapeutic footwear with custom-made orthotic devices have been shown to re- duce peak plantar pressures (84). Most studies use reduction in peak plantar pressures as an outcome as opposed to ulcer prevention. Certain design features of the orthoses, such",

A systematic review, however, showed there was no signi\ufb01- cant reduction in ulcer incidence after 18 months compared with standard insoles and extra-depth shoes. Fur- ther, it was also noted that evidence to prevent \ufb01rst ulcerations was non- existent (88). Treatment Treatment recommendations for people with diabetes will be determined by their risk category. No-risk or low-risk individuals can often be managed with education and self-care. People in the moderate- to high-risk category should be referred to foot care specialists for further evaluation and regular surveil- lance as outlined in Table 12.1. This in- cludes individuals with LOPS, PAD, and/ or structural foot deformities, such as Charcot foot, bunions, or hammertoes. Individuals with any open ulceration or unexplained swelling, erythema, or in- creased skin temperature should be re- ferred urgently to a foot care specialist or multidisciplinary team. Initial treatment recommendations should include daily foot inspection, use of moisturizers for dry, scaly skin, and avoidance of self-care of ingrown nails and calluses. Well-\ufb01tted athletic or walking shoes with customized pressure- relieving orthoses should be part of ini- tial recommendations for people with increased plantar pressures (as demon- strated by plantar calluses). Individuals with deformities such as bunions or hammertoes may require specialized footwear such as extra-depth shoes. Those with even more signi\ufb01cant de- formities, as in Charcot joint disease, may require custom-made footwear. Special consideration should be given to individuals with neuropathy who pre-",

These indi- viduals require a thorough workup for possible Charcot neuroarthropathy (89). Early diagnosis and treatment of this condition is of paramount importance in preventing deformities and instability that can lead to ulceration and amputa- tion. These individuals require total non\u2013 weight-bearing and urgent referral to a foot care specialist for further manage- ment. Foot and ankle X-rays should be performed in all individuals presenting with the above clinical \ufb01ndings. There have been a number of devel- opments in the treatment of ulcerations over the years (90). These include negative-pressure therapy, growth fac- tors, bioengineered tissue, acellular ma- trix tissue, stem cell therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and, most recently, topi- cal oxygen therapy (91\u201393). While there is literature to support many modalities currently used to treat diabetic foot wounds, robust randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often lacking. How- ever, it is agreed that the initial treat- ment and evaluation of ulcerations include the following \ufb01ve basic prin- ciples of ulcer treatment: \u2022 Of\ufb02oading of plantar ulcerations \u2022 Debridement of necrotic, nonviable tissue \u2022 Revascularization of ischemic wounds when necessary \u2022 Management of infection: soft tissue or bone \u2022 Use of physiologic, topical dressings However, despite following the above principles, some ulcerations will become chronic and fail to heal.

It has been determined that if a wound fails to show a reduc- tion of 50% or more after 4 weeks of appropriate wound management (i.e., the \ufb01ve basic principles above), consid- eration should be given to the use of advanced wound therapy (94). Treat- ment of these chronic wounds is best managed in a multidisciplinary setting. Evidence to support advanced wound therapy is challenging to produce and to assess. Randomization of trial partici- pants is dif\ufb01cult, as there are many variables that can affect wound heal- ing. In addition, many RCTs exclude certain cohorts of people, e.g., individu- als with chronic renal disease or those on dialysis. Finally, blinding of participants and clinicians is not always possible. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies are used to deter- mine the clinical effectiveness of these modalities. Such studies can augment for- mal RCTs by including a greater variety of participants in various clinical settings who are typically excluded from the more rigidly structured clinical trials. Advanced wound therapy can be cat- egorized into nine broad categories (90) (Table 12.2). Topical growth factors, acel- lular matrix tissues, and bioengineered cellular therapies are commonly em- ployed in of\ufb01ces and wound care cen- ters to expedite healing of chronic, more super\ufb01cial ulcerations. Numerous clinical reports and retrospective studies have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of each of these modalities. Over the years, there has been increased evidence to support the use of these modalities. diabetesjournals.org/care Retinopathy,",

    "text": "Nonetheless, use of those products or agents with robust RCTs or system- atic reviews should generally be pre- ferred over those without level 1 evidence (Table 12.2). Negative-pressure wound therapy was \ufb01rst introduced in the early to mid- 1990s. It has become especially useful in wound preparation for skin grafts and \ufb02aps and assists in the closure of deep, large wounds (95,96). A variety of types exist in the marketplace and range from electrically powered to mechanically powered in different sizes depending upon the speci\ufb01c wound requirements. Electrical stimulation, pulsed radio- frequency energy, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are biophysical mo- dalities that are believed to upregulate growth factors or cytokines to stimulate wound healing, while low-frequency non- contact ultrasound is used to debride wounds. However, most of the studies advocating the use of these modalities have been retrospective observational or poor-quality RCTs. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the de- livery of oxygen through a chamber, ei- ther individual or multiperson, with the intention of increasing tissue oxygena- tion to increase tissue perfusion and neovascularization, combat resistant bac- teria, and stimulate wound healing. While there had been great interest in this modality being able to expedite healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), there has only been one positive RCT published in the last decade that re- ported increased healing rates at 9 and 12 months compared with control subjects (97). More recent studies with signi\ufb01cant design de\ufb01ciencies and par- ticipant dropouts have failed to provide corroborating evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy",

While there may be some bene\ufb01t in prevention of amputation in selected chronic neuroischemic ulcers, recent stud- ies have shown no bene\ufb01t in healing DFUs in the absence of ischemia and/ or infection (93,100). Topical oxygen therapy has been studied rather vigorously in recent years, with several high-quality RCTs and at least \ufb01ve systematic reviews and meta- analyses all supporting its ef\ufb01cacy in healing chronic DFUs at 12 weeks (19,20,30\u201334,91,92,101\u2013105). Three types of topical oxygen devices are available, including continuous-delivery, low-constant-pressure, and cyclical- pressure modalities. Importantly, topical oxygen therapy devices provide for home-based therapy rather than the need for daily visits to specialized cen- ters. Very high participation with very few reported adverse events combined with improved healing rates makes this therapy another attractive option for ad- vanced wound care. If DFUs fail to heal despite appropriate wound care, adjunctive advanced thera- pies should be instituted and are best managed in a multidisciplinary manner. Once healed, all individuals should be enrolled in a formal comprehensive prevention program focused on reducing the incidence of recurrent ulcerations and subsequent amputations (75,106,107).

Over one- quarter of people over the age of 65 years have diabetes, and one-half of older adults have prediabetes (1,2), and the number of older adults living with these con- ditions is expected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. Diabetes in older adults is also a highly heterogeneous condition. While type 2 diabetes predomi- nates in the older population as much as in the younger population, improvements in insulin delivery, technology, and care over the last few decades have led to in- creasing numbers of people with childhood and adult-onset type 1 diabetes surviv- ing and thriving into their later decades. Diabetes management in older adults requires regular assessment of medical, psychological, functional, and social do- mains. When assessing older adults with diabetes, it is important to accurately cat- egorize the type of diabetes as well as other factors, including diabetes duration, the presence of complications, and treatment-related concerns, such as fear of hy- poglycemia. Screening for diabetes complications in older adults should be individu- alized and periodically revisited, as the results of screening tests may impact targets and therapeutic approaches (3\u20135). Older adults with diabetes have higher rates of premature death, functional disability, accelerated muscle loss, and coexist- ing illnesses, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke, than those Disclosure information for each author is available at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.

At the same time, older adults with diabetes are also at greater risk than other older adults for several common geriatric syndromes, such as polypharmacy, cognitive impair- ment, depression, urinary incontinence, injurious falls, persistent pain, and frailty (1). These conditions may impact older adults\u2019 diabetes self-management abili- ties and quality of life if left unaddressed (2,6,7). See Section 4, \u201cComprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities,\u201d for the full range of is- sues to consider when caring for older adults with diabetes. The comprehensive assessment de- scribed above may provide a framework to determine targets and therapeutic approaches (8\u201310), including whether referral for diabetes self-management education is appropriate (when compli- cating factors arise or when transitions in care occur) or whether the current plan is too complex for the individual\u2019s self-management ability or the care- givers providing care (11). Particular atten- tion should be paid to complications that can develop over short periods of time and/or would signi\ufb01cantly impair func- tional status, such as visual and lower- extremity complications. Please refer to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) con- sensus report \u201cDiabetes in Older Adults\u201d for details (3).

People with di- abetes have higher incidences of all- cause dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia than people with nor- mal glucose tolerance (14). The effects of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hy- perinsulinemia on the brain are areas of intense research. Poor glycemic control is associated with a decline in cognitive function (15,16), and longer duration of diabetes is associated with worsening cog- nitive function. There are ongoing studies evaluating whether preventing or delay- ing diabetes onset may help to maintain cognitive function in older adults. How- ever, studies examining the effects of intensive glycemic and blood pressure con- trol to achieve speci\ufb01c targets have not demonstrated a reduction in brain function decline (17,18). Clinical trials of speci\ufb01c interventions\u2014 including cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamatergic antagonists\u2014have not shown positive therapeutic bene\ufb01t in maintain- ing or signi\ufb01cantly improving cognitive function or in preventing cognitive de- cline (19). Pilot studies in individuals with mild cognitive impairment evaluat- ing the potential bene\ufb01ts of intranasal insulin therapy and metformin therapy provide insights for future clinical trials and mechanistic studies (20\u201323). Despite the paucity of therapies to prevent or remedy cognitive decline, identifying cognitive impairment early has important implications for diabetes care. The presence of cognitive impair- ment can make it challenging for clinicians to help their patients reach individualized glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid tar- gets. Cognitive dysfunction makes it dif\ufb01- cult for individuals to perform complex self-care tasks (24), such as monitoring glucose and adjusting insulin doses. It",

When clinicians are providing care for people with cognitive dysfunc- tion, it is critical to simplify care plans and to facilitate and engage the appropriate support structure to assist individuals in all aspects of care. Older adults with diabetes should be carefully screened and monitored for cognitive impairment (2). Several simple assessment tools are available to screen for cognitive impairment (24,25), such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (26), Mini-Cog (27), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (28), which may help to identify individuals requiring neuropsychological evaluation, particu- larly those in whom dementia is sus- pected (i.e., experiencing memory loss and decline in their basic and instru- mental activities of daily living). Annual screening is indicated for adults 65 years of age or older for early detection of mild cognitive impairment or dementia (4,29). Screening for cognitive impairment should additionally be considered when an individual presents with a signi\ufb01cant decline in clinical status due to increased problems with self-care activities, such as errors in calculating insulin dose, dif\ufb01culty counting carbohydrates, skipped meals, skipped insulin doses, and dif\ufb01culty rec- ognizing, preventing, or treating hypo- glycemia. People who screen positive for cognitive impairment should receive diagnostic assessment as appropriate, including referral to a behavioral health professional for formal cognitive/neuro- psychological evaluation (30).

A 13.6 For older adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily doses of insulin, continuous glucose monitoring should be considered to improve glyce- mic outcomes and decrease glucose variability. B 13.7 For older adults with type 1 dia- betes, consider the use of auto- mated insulin delivery systems B and other advanced insulin delivery devices such as con- nected pens E to reduce risk of hypoglycemia, based on individual ability. Older adults are at higher risk of hypo- glycemia for many reasons, including insulin de\ufb01ciency necessitating insulin therapy and progressive renal insuf\ufb01- ciency (31). As described above, older adults have higher rates of unidenti- \ufb01ed cognitive impairment and demen- tia, leading to dif\ufb01culties in adhering to complex self-care activities (e.g., glucose monitoring, insulin dose adjustment).

Therefore, as dis- cussed in Recommendation 13.3, it is important to routinely screen older adults for cognitive impairment and dementia and discuss \ufb01ndings with the patients and their caregivers. People with diabetes and their care- givers should be routinely queried about hypoglycemia (e.g., selected questions from the Diabetes Care Pro\ufb01le) (34) and hypoglycemia unawareness (35). Older adults can also be strati\ufb01ed for future risk for hypoglycemia with validated risk calcu- lators (e.g., Kaiser Hypoglycemia Model) (36). An important step to mitigate hypo- glycemia risk is to determine whether the person with diabetes is skipping meals or inadvertently repeating doses of their medications. Glycemic targets and phar- macologic treatments may need to be adjusted to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemic events (2). This recommen- dation is supported by results from mul- tiple randomized controlled trials, such as the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), which showed that intensive treatment protocols targeting A1C <6.0% with com- plex drug regimens signi\ufb01cantly increased the risk for hypoglycemia requiring assis- tance compared with standard treat- ment (37,38). However, these intensive treatment plans included extensive use of insulin and minimal use of glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and they preceded the availability of sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

In the Wireless Innovation in Seniors with Diabetes Mellitus (WISDM) trial, adults over 60 years of age with type 1 diabe- tes were randomized to CGM or stan- dard blood glucose monitoring.

A 6-month extension of the trial demon- strated that these bene\ufb01ts were sustained for up to a year (42). These and other short-term trials are supported by obser- vational data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study indicating that among older adults (mean age 58 years) with long-standing type 1 diabetes, routine CGM and insulin pump use was associ- ated with fewer hypoglycemic events and hyperglycemic excursions and lower A1C levels (43).While the current evidence base for older adults is pri- marily in type 1 diabetes, the evidence demonstrating the clinical bene\ufb01ts of CGM for people with type 2 diabetes using insulin is growing (44) (see Sec- tion 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d).

Another population for which CGM may play an increasing role is older adults with physical or cognitive lim- itations who require monitoring of blood glucose by a surrogate. The availability of accurate CGM devi- ces that can communicate with insulin pumps through Bluetooth has enabled the development of advanced insulin delivery algorithms for pumps. These al- gorithms fall into two categories: pre- dictive low-glucose suspend algorithms that automatically shut off insulin deliv- ery if a hypoglycemic event is imminent and hybrid closed-loop algorithms that automatically adjust insulin infusion rates based on feedback from a CGM to keep glucose levels in a target range. Ad- vanced insulin delivery devices have been shown to improve glycemic outcomes in both children and adults with type 1 dia- betes. Most trials of these devices have included a broad range of people with type 1 diabetes but relatively few older adults. Recently, two small randomized controlled trials in older adults have been published. The Older Adult Closed Loop (ORACL) trial in 30 older adults (mean age 67 years) with type 1 diabetes found that a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery strategy was associated with signi\ufb01cant improvements in time in range compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy (46).

In contrast to the ORACL study, no signi\ufb01cant differences in hypo- glycemia were observed. Both studies enrolled older individuals whose blood glucose was relatively well managed (mean A1C \u00037.4%), and both used a crossover design comparing hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery to sensor- augmented pump therapy. These trials provide the \ufb01rst evidence that older individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes can successfully use advanced insulin delivery technologies to improve glycemic outcomes, as has been seen in younger populations.

See Fig. 6.2 for patient/ disease-related factors to consider when determining individualized glycemic targets. A1C may have limitations in those who have medical conditions that im- pact red blood cell turnover (see Sec- tion 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes,\u201d for additional details on the limitations of A1C) (54).

In addition, de- clining or impaired ability to perform diabetes self-care behaviors may be an indication that an older person with dia- betes needs a referral for cognitive and physical functional assessment, using age- normalized evaluation tools, as well as help establishing a support structure for diabetes care (3,30). Patients With Complications and Reduced Functionality For people with advanced diabetes comp- lications, life-limiting comorbid illnesses, or substantial cognitive or functional im- pairments, it is reasonable to set less- intensive glycemic goals (Table 13.1). Factors to consider in individualizing gly- cemic goals are outlined in Fig. 6.2. Based on concepts of competing mortal- ity and time to bene\ufb01t, people with ad- vanced diabetes complications are less likely to bene\ufb01t from reducing the risk of microvascular complications (55). In addi- tion, they are more likely to suffer seri- ous adverse effects of therapeutics, such as hypoglycemia (56). However, those with poorly managed diabetes may be subject to acute complications of diabe- tes, including dehydration, poor wound healing, and hyperglycemic hyperosmo- lar coma. Glycemic goals should, at a minimum, avoid these consequences.

Compared with the healthy class, the cardiovascular class has the highest risk of frailty and subsequent mortality. Ad- ditional research is needed to develop a reproducible classi\ufb01cation scheme to distinguish the natural history of disease as well as differential response to glu- cose control and speci\ufb01c glucose-lowering agents (58). Vulnerable Patients at the End of Life For people with diabetes receiving pallia- tive care and end-of-life care, the focus should be to avoid hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia while reduc- ing the burdens of glycemic management.

It is important to match complexity of the treatment plan to the self-management ability of older adults with diabetes and their available social and medical support. Many older adults with diabetes struggle to maintain the fre- quent blood glucose monitoring and insu- lin injection regimens they previously followed, perhaps for many decades, as they develop medical conditions that may impair their ability to follow their treat- ment plan safely. Individualized glycemic goals should be established (Fig. 6.2) and periodically adjusted based on coexisting chronic illnesses, cognitive function, and functional status (2). Intensive glycemic control with regimens including insulin and sulfonylureas in older adults with complex or very complex medical con- ditions has been identi\ufb01ed as over- treatment and found to be very common in clinical practice (84\u201388). Ultimately, the determination of whether a person is considered overtreated requires an elicita- tion of the person\u2019s perceptions of the current medication burden and preferen- ces for treatments. For those seeking to simplify their diabetes regimen, deintensi- \ufb01cation of regimens in individuals taking noninsulin glucose-lowering medications can be achieved by either lowering the dose or discontinuing some medications, as long as the individualized glycemic tar- gets are maintained (89).

Thiazolidinediones Thiazolidinediones, if used at all, should be used very cautiously in older adults on in- sulin therapy as well as in those with or at risk for heart failure, osteoporosis, falls or fractures, and/or macular edema (97,98). Lower doses of a thiazolidinedione in com- bination therapy may mitigate these side effects. Insulin Secretagogues Sulfonylureas and other insulin secreta- gogues are associated with hypoglyce- mia and should be used with caution. If used, sulfonylureas with a shorter du- ration of action, such as glipizide, are preferred. Glyburide is a longer-acting sulfonylurea and should be avoided in older adults (99). Incretin-Based Therapies Oral dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have few side effects and minimal risk of hypoglycemia, but their cost may be a barrier to some older adults. DPP-4 inhibitors do not reduce or increase major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (100). Across the trials of this drug class, there appears to be no inter- action by age-group (101\u2013103). A chal- lenge of interpreting the age-strati\ufb01ed analyses of this drug class and other car- diovascular outcomes trials is that while most of these analyses were prespeci- \ufb01ed, they were not powered to detect differences. GLP-1 receptor agonists have demon- strated cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts among people with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and those at higher ASCVD risk, and newer trials are expanding our understanding of their bene\ufb01ts in other populations (100).

Given the gastrointestinal side effects of this class, GLP-1 receptor agonists may not be preferred in older adults who are experiencing unexplained weight loss. Sodium\u2013Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors SGLT2 inhibitors are administered orally, which may be convenient for older adults with diabetes. In those with established ASCVD, these agents have shown cardio- vascular bene\ufb01ts (100). This class of agents has also been found to be ben- e\ufb01cial for people with heart failure and to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. See Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d and Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,\u201d for a more extensive discussion regarding the indications for this class of agents.

While understanding of the clinical bene- \ufb01ts of this class is evolving, side effects such as volume depletion, urinary tract infections, and worsening urinary incon- tinence may be more common among older people. Insulin Therapy The use of insulin therapy requires that individuals or their caregivers have good visual and motor skills and cognitive abil- ity. Insulin therapy relies on the ability of the older person with diabetes to admin- ister insulin on their own or with the assis- tance of a caregiver.

When choosing a basal insulin, long-acting insulin ana- logs have been found to be associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia com- pared with NPH insulin in the Medicare population. Multiple daily injections of insulin may be too complex for an older person with advanced diabetes compli- cations, life-limiting coexisting chronic illnesses, or limited functional status. Figure 13.1 provides a potential ap- proach to insulin regimen simpli\ufb01cation. Other Factors to Consider The needs of older adults with diabetes and their caregivers should be evaluated to construct a tailored care plan. Im- paired social functioning may reduce these individuals\u2019 quality of life and in- crease the risk of functional dependency (7). The person\u2019s living situation must be considered as it may affect diabetes management and support needs. Social and instrumental support networks (e.g., adult children, caretakers) that provide instrumental or emotional support for older adults with diabetes should be in- cluded in diabetes management discus- sions and shared decision-making. The need for ongoing support of older adults becomes even greater when tran- sitions to acute care and long-term care (LTC) become necessary. Unfortunately, these transitions can lead to discontinu- ity in goals of care, errors in dosing, and changes in nutrition and activity (110). Older adults in assisted living facilities may not have support to administer their own medications, whereas those living in a nursing home (community liv- ing centers) may",

Those receiving palliative care (with or without hospice) may require an ap- proach that emphasizes comfort and symptom management while de- emphasizing strict metabolic and blood pressure control. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES Due in part to the success of modern di- abetes management, people with type 1 diabetes are living longer, and the popu- lation of these people over 65 years of age is growing (111\u2013113). Many of the recommendations in this section regard- ing a comprehensive geriatric assessment and personalization of goals and treat- ments are directly applicable to older adults with type 1 diabetes; however, this population has unique challenges and re- quires distinct treatment considerations (114). Insulin is an essential life-preserving therapy for people with type 1 diabetes, unlike for those with type 2 diabetes. To avoid diabetic ketoacidosis, older adults with type 1 diabetes need some form of basal insulin even when they are unable to ingest meals. Insulin may be delivered through an insulin pump or injections. CGM is approved for use by Medicare and can play a critical role in improving A1C, reducing glycemic variability, and reducing risk of hypoglycemia (45) (see Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d and Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\u201d). In older people with type 1 diabetes, administration of insulin may become more dif\ufb01cult as complications, cognitive impairment, and functional impairment arise. This in- creases the importance of caregivers in the lives of these individuals. Many",

Some staff may be less knowledgeable about the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In these instances, the individual or the person\u2019s family may be more familiar with their diabetes management plan than the staff or health care professio- nals. Education of relevant support staff and health care professionals in rehabil- itation and LTC settings regarding insu- lin dosing and use of pumps and CGM is recommended as part of general dia- betes education (see Recommendations 13.20 and 13.21).

LTC facilities should develop their own policies and procedures for prevention and management of hypogly- cemia. With the increased longevity of populations, the care of people with dia- betes and its complications in LTC is an area that warrants greater study. Resources Staff of LTC facilities should receive ap- propriate diabetes education to improve the management of older adults with diabetes. Treatments for each patient should be individualized. Special manage- ment considerations include the need to avoid both hypoglycemia and the compli- cations of hyperglycemia (2,116). For more information, see the ADA position statement \u201cManagement of Diabetes in Long-term Care and Skilled Nursing Facili- ties\u201d (115). Nutritional Considerations An older adult residing in an LTC facility may have irregular and unpredictable meal consumption, undernutrition, an- orexia, and impaired swallowing. Further- more, therapeutic diets may inadvertently lead to decreased food intake and con- tribute to unintentional weight loss and undernutrition. Meals tailored to a per- son\u2019s culture, preferences, and personal goals may increase quality of life, satisfac- tion with meals, and nutrition status (117). It may be helpful to give insulin af- ter meals to ensure that the dose is ap- propriate for the amount of carbohydrate the individual consumed in the meal.

Oral agents may achieve glycemic outcomes similar to basal insulin in LTC populations (84,119). CGM may be a use- ful approach to monitoring for hypogly- cemia among individuals treated with insulin in LTC, but the data are limited. Another consideration for the LTC set- ting is that unlike in the hospital setting, health care professionals are not required to evaluate patients daily. According to federal guidelines, assessments should be done at least every 30 days for the \ufb01rst 90 days after admission and then at least once every 60 days. Although in practice patients may actually be seen more frequently, the concern is that these individuals may have uncontrolled glucose levels or wide excursions with- out the practitioner being noti\ufb01ed. Health care professionals may adjust treat- ment plans by telephone, fax, or in person directly at the LTC facilities, pro- vided they are given timely noti\ufb01cation of blood glucose management issues from a standardized alert system. The following alert strategy could be considered: 1. Call health care professional imme- diately in cases of low blood glucose levels (<70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]). 2.

END-OF-LIFE CARE Recommendations 13.23 When palliative care is needed in older adults with diabetes, health care professionals should initiate conversations regard- ing the goals and intensity of care. Strict glucose and blood pressure control are not nec- essary E, and simpli\ufb01cation of regimens can be considered. Similarly, the intensity of lipid management can be relaxed, and withdrawal of lipid-lowering therapy may be appropriate. A 13.24 Overall comfort, prevention of distressing symptoms, and preservation of quality of life and dignity are primary goals for diabetes management at the end of life. C The management of the older adult at the end of life receiving palliative medi- cine or hospice care is a unique situation. Overall, palliative medicine promotes comfort, symptom control and preven- tion (pain, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and dehydration), and preservation of dignity and quality of life in older adults with limited life expectancy (116,120). In the setting of palliative care, health care professionals should initiate conversa- tions regarding the goals and intensity of diabetes care; strict glucose and blood pressure control may not be consistent with achieving comfort and quality of life. Avoidance of severe hypertension and hyperglycemia aligns with the goals of palliative care. In a multicenter trial, withdrawal of statins among people with diabetes in palliative care was found to improve quality of life (121\u2013123). The ev- idence for",

An individual has the right to refuse testing and treatment, whereas health care professionals may consider withdrawing treatment and lim- iting diagnostic testing, including a reduction in the frequency of blood glucose monitoring (125,126). Glucose targets should aim to prevent hypoglyce- mia and hyperglycemia. Treatment inter- ventions need to be mindful of quality of life. Careful monitoring of oral intake is warranted. The decision process may need to involve the individual, family, and caregivers, leading to a care plan that is both convenient and effective for the goals of care (127). The pharmaco- logic therapy may include oral agents as \ufb01rst line, followed by a simpli\ufb01ed insulin regimen. If needed, basal insulin can be implemented, accompanied by oral agents and without rapid-acting insulin. Agents that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or excess weight loss may not be good choices in this setting. As symptoms progress, some agents may be slowly tapered and discontinued.

In people with type 1 diabetes, insulin admin- istration may be reduced as the oral intake of food decreases but should not be stopped. For those with type 2 diabetes, agents that may cause hy- poglycemia should be reduced in dose. The main goal is to avoid hypo- glycemia, allowing for glucose values in the upper level of the desired tar- get range. 3. A dying patient: For people with type 2 diabetes, the discontinuation of all medications may be a reason- able approach, as these individuals are unlikely to have any oral intake. In people with type 1 diabetes, there is no consensus, but a small amount of basal insulin may maintain glucose levels and prevent acute hyperglyce- mic complications. References 1.

    "text": "TYPE 1 DIABETES Type 1 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in youth (4), although data suggest that it may account for a large proportion of cases diagnosed in adult life (5). The health care profes- sional must consider the unique aspects of care and management of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, such as changes in insulin sensitivity re- lated to physical growth and sexual maturation, ability to provide self-care, supervision in the childcare and school environment, neurological vulnerability to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in young children, and possible adverse neurocognitive effects of diabetic ketoa- cidosis (DKA) (6,7). Attention to family dynamics, developmental stages, and physiologic differences related to sexual maturity is essential in developing and implementing an optimal diabetes treat- ment plan (8). A multidisciplinary team trained in pedi- atric diabetes management and sensitive to the challenges of children and adoles- cents with type 1 diabetes and their fami- lies should provide diabetes-speci\ufb01c care for this population. It is essential that di- abetes self-management education and support, medical nutrition therapy, and psychosocial support be provided at di- agnosis and regularly thereafter in a de- velopmentally appropriate format that builds on prior knowledge by a team of health care professionals experienced with the biological, educational, nutri- tional, behavioral, and emotional needs of the growing child and family.

Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support Recommendation 14.1 Youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents/caregivers (for patients aged <18 years) should receive culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate individualized diabetes self- management education and sup- port according to national stand- ards at diagnosis and routinely thereafter. B Self-management in pediatric diabetes involves both the youth and their pa- rents/adult caregivers. No matter how sound the medical plan is, it can only be effective if the family and/or affected individuals are able to implement it. Family involvement is a vital compo- nent of optimal diabetes management throughout childhood and adolescence. As parents/caregivers are critical to dia- betes self-management in youth, diabe- tes care requires an approach that places the youth and their parents/caregivers at the center of the care model. The pediat- ric diabetes care team must be capable of evaluating the educational, behavioral, emotional, and psychosocial factors that impact the implementation of a treat- ment plan and must work with the youth and family to overcome barriers or rede- \ufb01ne goals as appropriate. Diabetes self- management education and support requires periodic reassessment, espe- cially as the youth grows, develops, and acquires the need and desire for greater independent self-care skills. The pediat- ric diabetes team should work with the youth and their parents/caregivers to ensure there is not a premature transfer of self-management tasks to the youth during this time. In addition, it is neces- sary to assess the educational needs and skills of, and provide training to,",

Nutrition Therapy Recommendations 14.2 Individualized medical nutri- tion therapy is recommended for youth with type 1 diabe- tes as an essential compo- nent of the overall treatment plan. A 14.3 Monitoring carbohydrate in- take, whether by carbohy- drate counting or experience- based estimation, is a key component to optimizing gly- cemic management. B 14.4 Comprehensive nutrition educa- tion at diagnosis, with annual updates, by an experienced reg- istered dietitian nutritionist, is recommended to assess caloric and nutrition intake in relation to weight status and cardiovas- cular disease risk factors and to inform macronutrient choices. E Nutrition management should be indi- vidualized: family habits, food preferen- ces, religious or cultural needs, \ufb01nances, schedules, physical activity, and the youth\u2019s and family\u2019s abilities in numeracy, literacy, and self-management should be consid- ered. Visits with a registered dietitian nu- tritionist should include assessment for changes in food preferences over time, access to food, growth, and develop- ment, weight status, cardiovascular risk, and potential for disordered eating. Fol- lowing recommended nutrition plans is associated with better glycemic outcomes in youth with type 1 diabetes (12).

C Physical activity and exercise positively impact metabolic and psychological health in children with type 1 diabetes (13). While it affects insulin sensitivity, physical \ufb01tness, strength building, weight management, social interaction, mood, self-esteem building, and the creation of healthful habits for adulthood, it also has the potential to cause both hypoglyce- mia and hyperglycemia. See below for strategies to mitigate hypoglycemia risk and minimize hyper- glycemia associated with exercise. For an in-depth discussion, see reviews and guidelines (14\u201316). Overall, it is recommended that youth participate in 60 min of moderate- intensity (e.g., brisk walking, dancing) to vigorous-intensity (e.g., running, jumping rope) aerobic activity daily, including resistance and \ufb02exibility train- ing (17). Although uncommon in the pe- diatric population, patients should be medically evaluated for comorbid condi- tions or diabetes complications that may restrict participation in an exercise pro- gram. As hyperglycemia can occur be- fore, during, and after physical activity, it is important to ensure that the ele- vated glucose level is not related to insulin de\ufb01ciency that would lead to worsening hyperglycemia with exercise and ketosis risk. Intense activity should be postponed with marked hyperglyce- mia (glucose $350 mg/dL [19.4 mmol/L]), moderate to large urine ketones, and/or b-hydroxybutyrate (B-OHB) >1.5 mmol/L. Caution may be needed when B-OHB levels are $0.6 mmol/L (12,14). The prevention and treatment of hy- poglycemia associated with physical ac- tivity include decreasing the prandial insulin for",

Decreasing basal rates or long-acting insulin doses by \u000120% after exercise may reduce delayed exercise-induced hypoglycemia (19). Ac- cessible rapid-acting carbohydrates and frequent blood glucose monitoring before, during, and after exercise, with or without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), maximize safety with exercise. The use of hybrid closed-loop systems may im- prove time in range (70\u2013180 mg/dL) dur- ing exercise, and youth can use \u201cexercise mode\u201d to prevent hypoglycemia (20). Blood glucose targets prior to physi- cal activity and exercise should be 126\u2013180 mg/dL (7.0\u201310.0 mmol/L) but should be individualized based on the type, intensity, and duration of activity (14,16). Consider additional carbohydrate intake during and/or after exercise, de- pending on the duration and intensity of physical activity, to prevent hypoglycemia. For low- to moderate-intensity aerobic ac- tivities (30\u201360 min), and if the youth is fasting, 10\u201315 g of carbohydrate may pre- vent hypoglycemia (21).

In addition, obesity is as common in youth with type 1 diabetes as in those without diabetes.

B Rapid and dynamic cognitive, develop- mental, and emotional changes occur dur- ing childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood. Diabetes management during childhood and adolescence places sub- stantial burdens on the youth and family, necessitating ongoing assessment of psy- chosocial status, social determinants of health, and diabetes distress in the youth and the parents/caregivers during routine diabetes visits (31\u201341). It is important to consider the impact of diabetes on quality of life as well as the development of men- tal health problems related to diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycemia (and hyper- glycemia), symptoms of anxiety, dis- ordered eating behaviors and eating disorders, and symptoms of depression (42). Consider screening youth for diabe- tes distress, generally starting at 7 or 8 years of age (43). Consider screening for depression and disordered eating behaviors using available screening tools (44,45). Early detection of depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and learn- ing disabilities can facilitate effective treatment options and help minimize adverse effects on diabetes manage- ment and disease outcomes (35,43). There are validated tools that can be used in assessing diabetes-speci\ufb01c distress in youth starting at age 8 years and in their parents/caregivers (36,46). Further- more, the complexities of diabetes man- agement require ongoing parental involvement in care throughout child- hood with developmentally appropriate family teamwork between the growing child/teen and parent in order to maintain engagement in self-management be- haviors and",

It is appropriate to inquire about diabetes-speci\ufb01c family con- \ufb02ict during visits and to either help to ne- gotiate a plan for resolution or refer to an appropriate mental health professional (49). Such professionals can conduct further assessment and deliver evidence- based behavioral interventions to support developmentally appropriate, collabo- rative family involvement in diabetes self-management (50,51). Monitoring of social adjustment (peer relationships) and school performance can facilitate both well-being and academic achieve- ment (52). Elevated A1C is a risk factor for underperformance at school and in- creased absenteeism (53). Shared decision-making with youth re- garding the adoption of management plan components and self-management behaviors can improve diabetes self- ef\ufb01cacy, participation in diabetes care, and metabolic outcomes (26,54). Although cognitive abilities vary, the ethical posi- tion often adopted is the \u201cmature minor rule,\u201d whereby children after age 12 or 13 years who appear to be \u201cmature\u201d have the right to consent or withhold consent to general medical treatment, except in cases in which refusal would signi\ufb01cantly endanger health (55). Beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis of diabetes, all individuals with childbearing potential should receive edu- cation about the risks of fetal malforma- tions associated with elevated A1C and the use of effective contraception to pre- vent unplanned pregnancy. Preconcep- tion counseling using developmentally appropriate educational and behavioral strategies enables individuals of child- bearing potential to make well-informed decisions (56).

Youth with type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of disordered eating be- havior as well as clinical eating disorders with serious short-term and long-term negative effects on diabetes outcomes and health in general. It is important to recognize the unique and dangerous disordered eating behavior of insulin omission for weight management in type 1 diabetes (58) using tools such as the Diabetes Eating Problems Survey- Revised (DEPS-R) to allow for early di- agnosis and intervention (45,59\u201361). Given the complexity of treating dis- ordered eating behaviors, collaboration between the diabetes health care team and a mental health professional, ideally with expertise in disordered eating be- haviors and diabetes, is recommended. The presence of a mental health pro- fessional on pediatric multidisciplinary teams highlights the importance of at- tending to the psychosocial issues of diabetes.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which did not enroll children <13 years of age, demonstrated that near normalization of blood glucose levels was more dif\ufb01cult to achieve in adolescents than in adults. Nevertheless, the increased use of basal-bolus regi- mens, insulin pumps, frequent blood glucose monitoring, CGM, automated insulin delivery systems, goal setting, and improved patient education has been as- sociated with more children and adoles- cents reaching the blood glucose targets recommended by the ADA (62\u201364), par- ticularly in families in which both the parents/caregivers and the child with diabetes participate jointly to perform the required diabetes-related tasks. Lower A1C in adolescence and young adulthood is associated with a lower risk and rate of microvascular and mac- rovascular complications (65\u201368) and demonstrates the effects of metabolic memory (69\u201372). In addition, type 1 diabetes can be as- sociated with adverse effects on cogni- tion during childhood and adolescence (6,73\u201375), and neurocognitive imaging differences related to hyperglycemia in children provide another motivation for achieving glycemic targets (6). DKA has been shown to cause adverse effects on brain development and function.

Please refer to Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d for more information on tech- nology to support people with diabetes. In selecting individualized glycemic targets, the long-term health bene\ufb01ts of achieving a lower A1C should be bal- anced against the risks of hypoglycemia and the developmental burdens of in- tensive treatment plans in youth (107). Recent data with newer devices and in- sulins indicate that the risk of hypogly- cemia with lower A1C is less than it was before (108\u2013117). Some data suggest that there could be a threshold where lower A1C is associated with more hypo- glycemia (118,119); however, the con\ufb01- dence intervals were large, suggesting great variability. In addition, achieving lower A1C levels is likely facilitated by setting lower A1C targets (120,121). Lower goals may be possible during the \u201choneymoon\u201d phase of type 1 diabetes. Special consideration should be given to the risk of hypoglycemia in young children (aged <6 years) who are often unable to recognize, articulate, and/or manage hy- poglycemia.However, registry data indicate that A1C targets can be achieved in chil- dren, including those aged <6 years, with- out increased risk of severe hypoglycemia (109,120).

A strong relationship exists between the frequency of blood glucose monitor- ing and glycemic management (84\u201386, 124\u2013130). Glucose levels for all children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes should be monitored multiple times daily by blood glucose monitoring and/or CGM. In the U.S., real-time CGM is ap- proved for nonadjunctive use in children aged 2 years and older and intermittently scanned CGM is approved for nonadjunc- tive use in children aged 4 years and older. Parents/caregivers and youth should be offered initial and ongoing education and support for CGM use. Behavioral sup- port may further improve ongoing CGM use (123). Metrics derived from CGM in- clude percent time in target range, below target range, and above target range (131). While studies indicate a relationship between time in range and A1C (132, 133), it is still uncertain what the ideal target time in range should be for chil- dren, and further studies are needed.

European guidelines on screening for celiac disease in children (not speci\ufb01c to children with type 1 diabetes) suggest that biopsy may not be necessary in symptomatic children with high anti- body titers (i.e., greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) provided that further testing is performed (veri\ufb01cation of endomysial antibody positivity on a separate blood sample) (156). Whether this approach may be appropriate for asymptomatic children in high-risk groups remains an open question, though evi- dence is emerging (157). It is also advis- able to check for celiac disease-associated HLA types in patients who are diagnosed without a small intestinal biopsy. In symp- tomatic children with type 1 diabetes and con\ufb01rmed celiac disease, gluten-free diets reduce symptoms and rates of hypoglyce- mia (158). The challenging dietary restric- tions associated with having both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease place a signi\ufb01- cant burden on individuals.

For both children and adults, non- HDL cholesterol level seems to be more predictive of persistent dyslipidemia and, therefore, atherosclerosis and fu- ture events than total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol levels alone. A major advantage of non-HDL cholesterol is that it can be accurately calculated in a nonfasting state and therefore is practical to obtain in clini- cal practice as a screening test (171). Youth with type 1 diabetes have a high prevalence of lipid abnormalities (164,172).

Pediatric lipid guidelines pro- vide some guidance relevant to children with type 1 diabetes and secondary dys- lipidemia (162,170,174,175); however, there are few studies on modifying lipid levels",

A 6-month trial of dietary counseling produced a signi\ufb01cant improvement in lipid levels (176); likewise, a lifestyle in- tervention trial with 6 months of exercise in adolescents demonstrated improve- ment in lipid levels (177). Data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study show that improved glucose over a 2-year period is associated with a more favorable lipid pro\ufb01le; however, improved glycemia alone will not normalize lipids in youth with type 1 diabetes and dyslipi- demia (173). Although intervention data are sparse, the American Heart Association catego- rizes children with type 1 diabetes in the highest tier for cardiovascular risk and recommends both lifestyle and pharma- cologic treatment for those with elevated LDL cholesterol levels (175,178). Initial therapy should include a nutrition plan that restricts saturated fat to 7% of total calories and dietary cholesterol to 200 mg/day (170). Data from random- ized clinical trials in children as young as 7 months of age indicate that this diet is safe and does not interfere with normal growth and development (179). Neither long-term safety nor cardio- vascular outcome ef\ufb01cacy of statin ther- apy has been established for children; however, studies have shown short-term safety equivalent to that seen in adults and ef\ufb01cacy in lowering LDL cholesterol levels in familial hypercholesterolemia or severe hyperlipidemia, improving endo- thelial function and causing regression of carotid intimal thickening (180,181).

Despite this, smoking rates are signi\ufb01cantly higher among youth with diabetes than among youth without diabetes (182,183). In youth with diabetes, it is important to avoid additional CVD risk factors. Smok- ing increases the risk of the onset of al- buminuria; therefore, smoking avoidance is important to prevent both microvas- cular and macrovascular complications (170,184). Discouraging cigarette smok- ing, including electronic cigarettes (185, 186), is an important part of routine dia- betes care.

The data also underscore the importance of routine screening to ensure early diagnosis and timely treat- ment of albuminuria (189). An estimation of glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR), cal- culated using GFR estimating equations from the serum creatinine, height, age, and sex (190), should be considered at baseline and repeated as indicated based on clinical status, age, diabetes duration, and therapies. Improved methods are needed to screen for early GFR loss since estimated GFR is inaccurate at GFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (190,191). The AdDIT study in adolescents with type 1 diabetes demonstrated the safety of ACE inhibitor treatment, but the treatment did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over the course of the study (162).

E Retinopathy (like albuminuria) most commonly occurs after the onset of pu- berty and after 5\u201310 years of diabetes duration (192). It is currently recognized that there is a low risk of development of vision-threatening retinal lesions prior to 12 years of age (193,194). A 2019 publi- cation based on the follow-up of the DCCT adolescent cohort supports a lower frequency of eye examinations than pre- viously recommended, particularly in adolescents with A1C closer to the target range (195,196). Referrals should be made to eye care professionals with ex- pertise in diabetic retinopathy and experi- ence in counseling pediatric patients and families on the importance of prevention, early detection, and intervention.

Foot inspec- tion can be performed at each visit to ed- ucate youth regarding the importance of foot care (see Section 12, \u201cRetinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care\u201d). TYPE 2 DIABETES For information on risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in chil- dren and adolescents, please refer to Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d For additional support for these recommendations, see the ADA position statement \u201cEvaluation and Management of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\u201d (3). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth has continued to increase over the past 20 years (4). The CDC published projections for type 2 diabetes prevalence using the SEARCH database; assuming a 2.3% annual increase, the prevalence in those under 20 years of age will quadru- ple in 40 years (199,200). Evidence suggests that type 2 diabe- tes in youth is different not only from type 1 diabetes but also from type 2 dia- betes in adults and has unique features, such as a more rapidly progressive de- cline in b-cell function and accelerated development of diabetes complications (3,201).

Additional risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes in youth include adiposity, family history of diabetes, female sex, and low socioeconomic status (201). As with type 1 diabetes, youth with type 2 diabetes spend much of the day in school. Therefore, close communica- tion with and the cooperation of school personnel are essential for optimal dia- betes management, safety, and maximal academic opportunities.

B 14.54 Children and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of pancreatic autoanti- bodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. B In the last decade, the incidence and prev- alence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has increased dramatically, especially in ra- cial and ethnic minority populations (170, 207). A few studies suggest oral glucose tolerance tests or fasting plasma glucose values as more suitable diagnostic tests than A1C in the pediatric population, es- pecially among certain ethnicities (208), al- though fasting glucose alone may over- diagnose diabetes in children (209,210). In addition, many of these studies do not rec- ognize that diabetes diagnostic criteria are based on long-term health outcomes, and validations are not currently available in the pediatric population (211). An analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey (NHANES) data suggests using A1C for screening of high-risk youth (212).

Diagnostic Challenges Given the current obesity epidemic, dis- tinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children can be dif\ufb01cult. Overweight and obesity are common in children with type 1 diabetes (27), and diabetes-associated autoantibodies and ketosis may be present in pediatric indi- viduals with clinical features of type 2 diabetes (including obesity and acantho- sis nigricans) (209). The presence of islet autoantibodies has been associated with faster progression to insulin de\ufb01- ciency (209). At the onset, DKA occurs in \u00016% of youth aged 10\u201319 years with type 2 diabetes (215). Although uncom- mon, type 2 diabetes has been ob- served in prepubertal children under the age of 10 years, and thus it should be part of the differential in children with suggestive symptoms (216). Finally, obesity contributes to the development of type 1 diabetes in some individuals (217), which further blurs the lines be- tween diabetes types. However, accu- rate diagnosis is critical, as treatment plans, educational approaches, dietary advice, and outcomes differ markedly between patients with the two diag- noses. The signi\ufb01cant diagnostic dif\ufb01cul- ties posed by MODY are discussed in Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d In addition, there are rare and atypical diabetes cases that represent a challenge for clinicians and researchers.

A The results of weight loss and lifestyle in- terventions for obesity in children and adolescents have been disappointing, and treatment options as adjuncts to life- style therapy are limited. Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved medications for youth ages 12 and older include phentermine and topiramate ex- tended-release capsules and liraglutide (234\u2013236). Over the last decade, weight loss surgery has been increasingly per- formed in adolescents with obesity. Small retrospective analyses and a prospective multicenter, nonrandomized study sug- gest that bariatric or metabolic surgery may have bene\ufb01ts in adolescents with obesity and type 2 diabetes similar to those observed in adults. Teenagers ex- perience similar degrees of weight loss, diabetes remission, and improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors for at least 3 years after surgery (237). A secondary data analysis from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen- LABS) and TODAY studies suggests surgi- cal treatment of adolescents with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes is associated with improved glycemia (238); however, no randomized trials have yet compared the effectiveness and safety of surgery to those of conventional treatment op- tions in adolescents (239). The guidelines used as an indication for metabolic surgery in adolescents generally include BMI >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities or BMI >40 kg/m2 with or without comor- bidities (240\u2013251). A number of groups, including the Pediatric Bariatric Study Group and Teen-LABS study, have dem- onstrated the effectiveness of metabolic surgery in adolescents (244\u2013250).

B Comorbidities may already be present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabe- tes in youth (201,252). Therefore, blood pressure measurement, a fasting lipid panel, assessment of random urine al- bumin-to-creatinine ratio, and a dilated eye examination should be performed at diagnosis. Additional medical condi- tions that may need to be addressed in- clude polycystic ovary disease and other comorbidities associated with pediatric obesity, such as sleep apnea, hepatic steatosis, orthopedic complications, and psychosocial concerns. The ADA position statement \u201cEvaluation and Manage- ment of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\u201d (3) provides guidance on the preven- tion, screening, and treatment of type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities in chil- dren and adolescents. Youth-onset type 2 diabetes is associ- ated with signi\ufb01cant microvascular and macrovascular risk burden and a sub- stantial increase in the risk of cardiovas- cular morbidity and mortality at an earlier age than in those diagnosed later in life (202,253). The higher complica- tion risk in earlier-onset type 2 diabetes is likely related to prolonged lifetime ex- posure to hyperglycemia and other ath- erogenic risk factors, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and chronic in\ufb02ammation. There is a low risk of hypoglycemia in youth with type 2 diabetes, even if they are being treated with insulin (254), and there are high rates of complications (219\u2013222). diabetesjournals.org/care Children and Adolescents S245 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

In addition, the progression of vascular abnormali- ties appears to be more pronounced in youth-onset type 2 diabetes than with type 1 diabetes of similar duration, in- cluding ischemic heart disease and stroke (255). Psychosocial Factors Recommendations 14.106 Health care professionals should screen for food inse- curity, housing instability/ homelessness, health literacy, \ufb01nancial barriers, and social/ community support and apply that information to treatment decisions.

Evidence about psychiatric disorders and symptoms in youth with type 2 dia- betes is limited (256\u2013260), but given the sociocultural context for many youth and the medical burden and obesity associ- ated with type 2 diabetes, ongoing sur- veillance of mental health/behavioral health is indicated. Symptoms of depres- sion and disordered eating are common and associated with poorer glycemic con- trol (39,257,261,262). Many of the medications prescribed for diabetes and psychiatric disorders are associated with weight gain and can increase concerns about eating, body shape, and weight (263,264). The TODAY study documented high rates of maternal complications during pregnancy and low rates of preconcep- tion counseling and contraception use (265). TRANSITION FROM PEDIATRIC TO ADULT CARE Recommendations 14.111 Pediatric diabetes care teams should begin to prepare youth for transition to adult health care in early adolescence and, at the latest, at least 1 year before the transition. E 14.112 Both pediatric and adult diabe- tes care professionals should provide support and resources for transitioning young adults. E 14.113 Youth with type 2 diabetes should be transferred to an adult-oriented diabetes spe- cialist when deemed appro- priate by the young adult and health care professional.

During this period of major life transitions, youth may be- gin to move out of their parents\u2019 homes and become increasingly responsible for their diabetes care. Their new responsi- bilities include self-management of their diabetes, making medical appointments, and \ufb01nancing health care once they are no longer covered by their parents\u2019 health insurance plans (ongoing coverage until age 26 years is currently available under provisions of the U.S. Affordable Care Act). In addition to lapses in health care, this is also a period associated with dete- rioration in glycemic stability; increased occurrence of acute complications; psy- chosocial, emotional, and behavioral chal- lenges; and the emergence of chronic complications (267\u2013272). The transition period from pediatric to adult care is prone to fragmentation in health care de- livery, which may adversely impact health care quality, cost, and outcomes (273). Worsening diabetes health outcomes during the transition to adult care and early adulthood have been documented (274,275). Although scienti\ufb01c evidence is limited, it is clear that comprehensive and coordi- nated planning that begins in early ado- lescence is necessary to facilitate a seamless transition from pediatric to adult health care (267,268,276,277). New technologies and other interventions are being tried to support the transition to adult care in young adulthood (278\u2013282). Given the behavioral, psychosocial,",

Diabetes confers signi\ufb01cantly greater maternal and fetal risk largely related to the degree of hyperglycemia but also related to chronic complications and co- morbidities of diabetes. In general, speci\ufb01c risks of diabetes in pregnancy include spontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies, preeclampsia, fetal demise, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syn- drome, among others. In addition, diabetes in pregnancy may increase the risk of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in offspring later in life (1,2). Preconception Counseling Recommendations 15.1 Starting at puberty and continuing in all people with diabetes and re- productive potential, preconception counseling should be incorporated into routine diabetes care. A 15.2 Family planning should be discussed, and effective contraception (with consideration of long-acting, reversible contraception) should be pre- scribed and used until an individual\u2019s treatment plan and A1C are opti- mized for pregnancy. A 15.3 Preconception counseling should address the importance of achieving glucose levels as close to normal as is safely possible, ideally A1C <6.5% (48 mmol/mol), to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies, pre- eclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, and other complications.

Observational studies show an increased risk of diabetic embryopathy, especially anencephaly, microcephaly, con- genital heart disease, renal anomalies, and caudal regression, directly propor- tional to elevations in A1C during the \ufb01rst 10 weeks of pregnancy (3). Although observational studies are confounded by the association between elevated peri- conceptional A1C and other engagement in self-care behaviors, the quantity and consistency of data are convincing and support the recommendation to opti- mize glycemia prior to conception, given that organogenesis occurs pri- marily at 5\u20138 weeks of gestation, with an A1C <6.5% (48 mmol/mol), which is associated with the lowest risk of congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, and preterm birth (3\u20137). A systematic review and meta-analysis of observa- tional studies of preconception care for pregnant individuals with preexisting dia- betes demonstrated lower A1C and re- duced risk of birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-ges- tational-age births, and neonatal inten- sive care unit admission (8). There are opportunities to educate all adults and adolescents with diabetes and reproductive potential about the risks of unplanned pregnancies and about improved maternal and fetal out- comes with pregnancy planning (8). Ef- fective preconception counseling could avert substantial health and associated cost burdens in offspring (9). Family planning should be discussed, including the bene\ufb01ts of long-acting, reversible contraception, and effective contracep- tion should be prescribed and used until",

To minimize the occurrence of compli- cations, beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis, all adults and adolescents with diabetes of childbearing potential should receive education about 1) the risks of malformations associated with un- planned pregnancies and even mild hy- perglycemia and 2) the use of effective contraception at all times when prevent- ing a pregnancy. Preconception counsel- ing using developmentally appropriate educational tools enables adolescent girls to make well-informed decisions (8). Pre- conception counseling resources tailored for adolescents are available at no cost through the American Diabetes Associa- tion (ADA) (15). Preconception Care Recommendations 15.4 Individuals with preexisting diabetes who are planning a pregnancy should ideally begin receiving care in preconception at a multidisciplinary clinic in- cluding an endocrinologist, ma- ternal-fetal medicine specialist, registered dietitian nutritionist, and diabetes care and education specialist, when available. B 15.5 In addition to focused attention on achieving glycemic targets A, standard preconception care should be augmented with ex- tra focus on nutrition, diabetes education, and screening for diabetes comorbidities and complications. B 15.6 Individuals with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are planning a pregnancy or who have become pregnant should be counseled on the risk of de- velopment and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy.

B The importance of preconception care for all pregnant people is highlighted by American College of Obstetricians and Gy- necologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion 762, \u201cPrepregnancy Counseling\u201d (16). Pre- conception counseling for pregnant peo- ple with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes is highly effective in reducing the risk of congenital malformations and de- creasing the risk of preterm delivery and admission to neonatal intensive care units. Preconception counseling likely also re- duces perinatal mortality and small-for- gestational-age birth weight (17). A key point is the need to incorporate a ques- tion about plans for pregnancy into the routine primary and gynecologic care of people with diabetes. Preconception care for people with diabetes should in- clude the standard screenings and care recommended for any person planning pregnancy (16). Prescription of prenatal vitamins with at least 400 mg of folic acid and 150 mg of potassium iodide (18) is recommended prior to concep- tion. Review and counseling on the use of nicotine products, alcohol, and recrea- tional drugs, including marijuana, is im- portant. Standard care includes screening for sexually transmitted diseases and thy- roid disease, recommended vaccinations, routine genetic screening, a careful re- view of all prescription and nonprescrip- tion medications and supplements used, and a review of travel history and plans with special attention to areas known to have Zika virus, as outlined by ACOG.

Diabetes-speci\ufb01c counseling should include an explanation of the risks to mother and fetus related to pregnancy and the ways to reduce risk, including glycemic goal setting, lifestyle and be- havioral management, and medical nutrition therapy (17). The most impor- tant diabetes-speci\ufb01c component of preconception care is the attainment of glycemic goals prior to conception. In addition, the presence of microvas- cular complications is associated with higher risk of disease progression and adverse pregnancy outcomes (20). Dia- betes-speci\ufb01c testing should include A1C, creatinine, and urinary albumin- to-creatinine ratio. Special attention should be paid to the review of the medication list for potentially harmful drugs, i.e., ACE inhibitors (21,22), an- giotensin receptor blockers (21), and statins (22,23). A referral for a compre- hensive eye exam is recommended.

Glucose targets are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h post- prandial glucose <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or 2-h post- prandial glucose <120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L). Some individ- uals with preexisting diabetes should also check blood glu- cose preprandially. B 15.8 Due to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in peo- ple with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C target in preg- nancy is <6% (42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved with- out signi\ufb01cant hypoglycemia, but the target may be relaxed to <7% (53 mmol/mol) if neces- sary to prevent hypoglycemia. B 15.9 When used in addition to pre- and postprandial blood glucose monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring can help to achieve the A1C target in diabetes and pregnancy. B 15.10 When used in addition to blood glucose monitoring, targeting traditional pre- and postpran- dial targets, real-time continu- ous glucose monitoring can reduce macrosomia and neo- natal hypoglycemia in preg- nancy complicated by type 1 diabetes.

E Pregnancy in people with normal glu- cose metabolism is characterized by fasting levels of blood glucose that are lower than in the nonpregnant state due to insulin-independent glucose up- take by the fetus and placenta and by mild postprandial hyperglycemia and car- bohydrate intolerance as a result of dia- betogenic placental hormones. In people with preexisting diabetes, glycemic tar- gets are usually achieved through a com- bination of insulin administration and medical nutrition therapy. Because glyce- mic targets in pregnancy are stricter than in nonpregnant individuals, it is impor- tant that pregnant people with diabetes eat consistent amounts of carbohy- drates to match with insulin dosage and to avoid hyperglycemia or hypo- glycemia. Referral to an RDN is impor- tant to establish a food plan and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and de- termine weight gain goals. The quality of the carbohydrates should be evaluated. A subgroup analysis of the Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnant Women With Type 1 Diabetes Trial (CONCEPTT) study demonstrated that the diets of indi- viduals planning pregnancy and currently pregnant assessed during the run-in phase prior to randomization were char- acterized by high-fat, low-\ufb01ber, and poor- quality carbohydrate intakes.

A diet that severely restricts any macronutrient class should be avoided, speci\ufb01cally the ketogenic diet that lacks carbohydrates, the Paleo diet because of dairy restriction, and any diet characterized by excess saturated fats. Nutrient-dense, whole foods are recommended, including fruits, vegeta- bles, legumes, whole grains, and healthy fats with n-3 fatty acids that include nuts and seeds and \ufb01sh, which are less likely to promote excessive weight gain. Processed foods, fatty red meat, and sweetened foods and beverages should be limited (26). Insulin Physiology Given that early pregnancy is a time of enhanced insulin sensitivity and lower glucose levels, many people with type 1 diabetes will have lower insulin require- ments and an increased risk for hypo- glycemia (27). Around 16 weeks, insulin resistance begins to increase, and total daily insulin doses increase linearly \u00035% per week through week 36. This usually results in a doubling of daily insulin dose compared with the prepregnancy require- ment. The insulin requirement levels off toward the end of the third trimester with placental aging. A rapid reduction in insulin requirements can indicate the de- velopment of placental insuf\ufb01ciency (28). In people with normal pancreatic func- tion, insulin production is suf\ufb01cient to meet the challenge of this physiological insulin resistance and to maintain normal glucose levels. However, in people with diabetes, hyperglycemia occurs if treat- ment is not adjusted appropriately. Glucose Monitoring Re\ufb02ecting this physiology, fasting and postprandial blood glucose monitoring is recommended to achieve metabolic control in pregnant people",

Postprandial monitoring is asso- ciated with better glycemic outcomes and a lower risk of preeclampsia (29\u201331). There are no adequately pow- ered randomized trials comparing differ- ent fasting and postmeal glycemic targets in diabetes in pregnancy. Similar to the targets recommended by ACOG (upper limits are the same as for GDM, described below) (32), the ADA-recommended targets for pregnant people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are as follows: \u2022 Fasting glucose 70\u201395 mg/dL (3.9\u20135.3 mmol/L) and either \u2022 One-hour postprandial glucose 110\u2013140 mg/dL (6.1\u20137.8 mmol/L) or \u2022 Two-hour postprandial glucose 100\u2013120 mg/dL (5.6\u20136.7 mmol/L) Lower limits are based on the mean of normal blood glucose in pregnancy (33). Lower limits do not apply to individ- uals with type 2 diabetes treated with nutrition alone. Hypoglycemia in preg- nancy is as de\ufb01ned and treated in Rec- ommendations 6.10\u20136.15 (Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets\u201d). These values repre- sent optimal control if they can be achieved safely. In practice, it may be challenging for a person with type 1 dia- betes to achieve these targets without hypoglycemia, particularly those with a history of recurrent hypoglycemia or hy- poglycemia unawareness.

In the Hyperglyce- mia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study, increasing levels of glyce- mia were also associated with worsening outcomes (35). Observational studies in preexisting diabetes and pregnancy show the lowest rates of adverse fetal out- comes in association with A1C <6\u20136.5% (42\u201348 mmol/mol) early in gestation (4\u20136,36). Clinical trials have not evalu- ated the risks and bene\ufb01ts of achieving these targets, and treatment goals should account for the risk of maternal hypoglycemia in setting an individualized target of <6% (42 mmol/mol) to <7% (53 mmol/mol). Due to physiological in- creases in red blood cell turnover, A1C levels fall during normal pregnancy (37,38). Additionally, as A1C represents an integrated measure of glucose, it may not fully capture postprandial hyperglyce- mia, which drives macrosomia. Thus, al- though A1C may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic outcomes in pregnancy, after blood glu- cose monitoring. In the second and third trimesters, A1C <6% (42 mmol/mol) has the lowest risk of large-for-gestational-age infants (36,39,40), preterm delivery (41), and preeclampsia (1,42).

Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnancy CONCEPTT was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of real-time continuous glu- cose monitoring (CGM) in addition to standard care, including optimization of pre- and postprandial glucose targets versus standard care for pregnant peo- ple with type 1 diabetes. It demon- strated the value of real-time CGM in pregnancy complicated by type 1 dia- betes by showing a mild improvement in A1C without an increase in hypogly- cemia and reductions in large-for-ges- tational-age births, length of stay, and neonatal hypoglycemia (44). An obser- vational cohort study that evaluated the glycemic variables reported using CGM found that lower mean glucose, lower standard deviation, and a higher percentage of time in target range were associated with lower risk of large-for-gestational-age births and other adverse neonatal outcomes (45). Use of the CGM-reported mean glucose is supe- rior to the use of estimated A1C, glucose management indicator, and other calcula- tions to estimate A1C, given the changes to A1C that occur in pregnancy (46).

Those in DKA who are unable to eat of- ten require 10% dextrose with an insu- lin drip to adequately meet the higher carbohydrate demands of the placenta and fetus in the third trimester in order to resolve their ketosis. Retinopathy is a special concern in preg- nancy. The necessary rapid implementation of euglycemia in the setting of retinopa- thy is associated with worsening of reti- nopathy (106). Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity. Recommended weight gain dur- ing pregnancy for people with overweight is 15\u201325 lb and for those with obesity is 10\u201320 lb (63). There are no adequate data on optimal weight gain versus weight maintenance in pregnant peo- ple with BMI >35 kg/m2. Optimal glycemic targets are often eas- ier to achieve during pregnancy with type 2 diabetes than with type 1 diabetes but can require much higher doses of in- sulin, sometimes necessitating concen- trated insulin formulations. Insulin is the preferred treatment for type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. An RCT of metformin added to insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes found less maternal weight gain and fewer cesarean births. There were fewer macrosomic neonates, but there was a doubling of small-for- gestational-age neonates (107). As in type 1 diabetes, insulin requirements drop dramatically after delivery. The risk for associated hypertension and other comorbidities may be as high or higher with type 2 diabetes as with type 1 diabetes, even if diabetes is bet- ter",

PREECLAMPSIA AND ASPIRIN Insulin Use Recommendation 15.20 Pregnant individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes should be prescribed low-dose aspirin 100\u2013150 mg/day starting at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation to lower the risk of preeclampsia. E A dosage of 162 mg/day may be acceptable E; currently, in the U.S., low-dose aspirin is available in 81-mg tablets. Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia (110). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends using low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) as a preventive medication at 12 weeks of gestation in individuals at high risk for preeclampsia (111). How- ever, a meta-analysis and an additional trial demonstrate that low-dose aspirin <100 mg is not effective in reducing preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin >100 mg is required (112\u2013114). A cost-bene\ufb01t analysis has concluded that this ap- proach would reduce morbidity, save lives, and lower health care costs (115). However, there is insuf\ufb01cient data regard- ing bene\ufb01ts of aspirin in pregnant people with preexisting diabetes (116,117).

PREGNANCY AND DRUG CONSIDERATIONS Recommendations 15.21 In pregnant individuals with diabetes and chronic hyper- tension, a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mmHg for initiation or titration of ther- apy is associated with better pregnancy outcomes than re- serving treatment for severe hypertension, with no increase in risk of small-for-gestational- age birth weight. A There are limited data on the optimal lower limit, but therapy should be lessened for blood pressure <90/60 mmHg. E A blood pres- sure target of 110\u2013135/85 mmHg is suggested in the interest of reducing the risk for acceler- ated maternal hypertension. A 15.22 Potentially harmful medica- tions in pregnancy (i.e., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins) should be stopped prior to conception and avoided in sexually active individuals of childbearing po- tential who are not using reli- able contraception. B In normal pregnancy, blood pressure is lower than in the nonpregnant state. The Chronic Hypertension and Preg- nancy (CHAP) Trial Consortium\u2019s RCT on treatment for mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy demonstrated that a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, as the threshold for initiation or titration of treatment, reduces the incidence of ad- verse pregnancy outcomes without com- promising fetal growth (118). The CHAP Consortium\u2019s study mitigates concerns about small-for-gestational-age birth weight. Attained mean \u00b1 SD blood pressure measurements in the treated versus untreated groups were systolic 129.5 \u00b1 10.0 vs. 132.6 \u00b1 10.1 mmHg (between-group difference \u00043.11 [95% CI \u00043.95",

Individuals with diabetes had an even better composite outcome score than those without diabetes (118). As a result of the CHAP study, ACOG issued a Practice Advisory recommend- ing a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg as the threshold for initiation or titration of medical therapy for chronic hyperten- sion in pregnancy (119) rather than their previously recommended threshold of 160/110 mmHg (120). The CHAP study provides additional guidance for the management of hyper- tension in pregnancy. Data from the previously published Control of Hyperten- sion in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) supports a target blood pressure goal of 110\u2013135/ 85 mmHg to reduce the risk of uncon- trolled maternal hypertension and mini- mize impaired fetal growth (120\u2013122). The 2015 study (121) excluded pregnan- cies complicated by preexisting diabetes, and only 6% of participants had GDM at enrollment. There was no difference in pregnancy loss, neonatal care, or other neonatal outcomes between the groups with tighter versus less tight control of hypertension (121). During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor block- ers is contraindicated because they may cause fetal renal dysplasia, oligohydram- nios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and intra- uterine growth restriction (21). A large study found that after adjust- ing for confounders, \ufb01rst trimester ACE inhibitor exposure does not appear to be associated with congenital malforma- tions (123). However, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped as soon as possible in the \ufb01rst",

Antihyperten- sive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, nifedipine, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine, and prazosin. Atenolol is not recom- mended, but other b-blockers may be used, if necessary. Chronic diuretic use during pregnancy is not recommended as it has been associated with restricted maternal plasma volume, which may re- duce uteroplacental perfusion (124). On the basis of available evidence, statins should also be avoided in pregnancy (125). See pregnancy and antihypertensive medications in Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,\u201d for more information on managing blood pressure in pregnancy.

In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for dia- betes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose ($126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glu- cose ($200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are ab- normal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of diabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be re- peated to con\ufb01rm that the abnormality persists. OGTT testing immediately post- partum, while still hospitalized, has demonstrated improved engagement in testing but also variably reduced sensi- tivity to the diagnosis of impaired fast- ing glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes (126,127). Postpartum Follow-up The OGTT is recommended over A1C at 4\u201312 weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased red blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at de- livery, or by the preceding 3-month glu- cose pro\ufb01le. The OGTT is more sensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes. Individu- als of childbearing potential with predia- betes may develop type 2 diabetes by the time of their next pregnancy and will need preconception evaluation. Because GDM is associated with an increased life- time maternal risk for diabetes estimated at 50\u201360% (128,129), individuals should also be tested every 1\u20133 years thereafter",

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Type 2 Diabetes Individuals with a history of GDM have a greatly increased risk of conversion to type 2 diabetes over time (129), and those with GDM have a 10-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes com- pared with those without GDM (128). Absolute risk of developing type 2 diabe- tes after GDM increases linearly through a person\u2019s lifetime, being approximately 20% at 10 years, 30% at 20 years, 40% at 30 years, 50% at 40 years, and 60% at 50 years (129). In the prospective Nurses\u2019 Health Study II (NHS II), subsequent dia- betes risk after a history of GDM was sig- ni\ufb01cantly lower in those who followed healthy eating patterns (130). Adjusting for BMI attenuated this association mod- erately, but not completely. Interpreg- nancy weight gain is associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy out- comes (131) and higher risk of GDM, while in people with BMI >25 kg/m2, weight loss is associated with lower risk of developing GDM in the subsequent pregnancy (132). Development of type 2 diabetes is 18% higher per unit of BMI increase from prepregnancy BMI at follow-up, highlighting the importance of effective weight management after GDM (133). In addition, postdelivery lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes (134). Both",

Only \ufb01ve to six indi- viduals with prediabetes and a history of GDM need to be treated with either inter- vention to prevent one case of diabetes over 3 years (135). In these individuals, life- style intervention and metformin reduced progression to diabetes by 35% and 40%, respectively, over 10 years compared with placebo (136). If the pregnancy has moti- vated the adoption of healthy nutrition, building on these gains to support weight loss is recommended in the postpartum period. (See Section 3, \u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities.\u201d) Preexisting Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Insulin sensitivity increases dramatically with the delivery of the placenta. In one study, insulin requirements in the immedi- ate postpartum period are roughly 34% lower than prepregnancy insulin require- ments (137). Insulin sensitivity then re- turns to prepregnancy levels over the following 1\u20132 weeks. For individuals tak- ing insulin, particular attention should be directed to hypoglycemia prevention in the setting of breastfeeding and erratic sleep and eating schedules (138). Lactation Considering the immediate nutritional and immunological bene\ufb01ts of breastfeed- ing for the baby, all mothers, including those with diabetes, should be supported in attempts to breastfeed.

Contraception A major barrier to effective preconcep- tion care is the fact that the majority of pregnancies are unplanned. Planning pregnancy is critical in individuals with preexisting diabetes to achieve the opti- mal glycemic targets necessary to pre- vent congenital malformations and reduce the risk of other complications. Therefore, all individuals with diabetes of child- bearing potential should have family planning options reviewed at regular intervals to make sure that effective contraception is implemented and main- tained. This applies to individuals in the immediate postpartum period. Individu- als with diabetes have the same contra- ception options and recommendations as those without diabetes. Long-acting, re- versible contraception may be ideal for individuals with diabetes and childbear- ing potential. The risk of an unplanned pregnancy outweighs the risk of any cur- rently available contraception option. References 1. Dabelea D, Hanson RL, Lindsay RS, et al.

Because inpatient treat- ment and discharge planning are more ef- fective if based on preadmission glycemia, A1C should be measured for all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia admit- ted to the hospital if an A1C test has not been performed in the previous 3 months (5\u20138). In addition, diabetes self-manage- ment knowledge and behaviors should be assessed on admission, and diabetes self-management education provided, es- pecially if a new treatment plan is being considered. Diabetes self-management education should include appropriate skills needed after discharge, such as medica- tion dosing and administration, glucose monitoring, and recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia (9,10). Evidence supports preadmission treatment of hyperglycemia in people scheduled for elective sur- gery as an effective means of reducing adverse outcomes (11\u201314). The National Academy of Medicine recommends CPOE to prevent medication- related errors and increase medication administration ef\ufb01ciency (15). Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials using computerized advice to improve glycemic outcomes in the hospital found signi\ufb01cant improvement in the percent- age of time individuals spent in the target glucose range, lower mean blood glucose levels, and no increase in hypoglycemia (16,17).

Diabetes Care Specialists in the Hospital Recommendation 16.3 When caring for hospitalized people with diabetes, consult with a specialized diabetes or glucose management team when possible. C Appropriately trained specialists or spe- cialty teams may reduce the length of stay and improve glycemic and other clini- cal outcomes (21\u201323). In addition, the increased risk of 30-day readmission fol- lowing hospitalization that has been at- tributed to diabetes can be reduced, and costs saved when inpatient care is pro- vided by a specialized diabetes manage- ment team (21,24,25). In a cross-sectional study comparing usual care to specialists reviewing diabetes cases and making recommendations virtually through the EHR, rates of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were reduced by 30\u201340% (26). Providing inpatient diabetes educa- tion and developing a diabetes discharge plan that includes continued access to dia- betes medications and supplies and on- going education and support are key strategies to improve outcomes (27\u201329).

GLYCEMIC TARGETS IN HOSPITALIZED ADULTS Recommendations 16.4 Insulin therapy should be initi- ated for the treatment of per- sistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold $180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) (checked on two occasions). Once insulin ther- apy is started, a target glu- cose range of 140\u2013180 mg/dL (7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L) is recom- mended for most critically ill and noncritically ill patients. A 16.5 More stringent goals, such as 110\u2013140 mg/dL (6.1\u20137.8 mmol/L) or 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L), may be appropriate for selected pa- tients and are acceptable if they can be achieved without signi\ufb01cant hypoglycemia. C Standard De\ufb01nitions of Glucose Abnormalities Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is de- \ufb01ned as blood glucose levels >140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) (33). Blood glucose levels persistently above this level warrant prompt interventions, such as alterations in nu- trition or changes to medications that cause hyperglycemia. An admission A1C value $6.5% (48 mmol/mol) suggests that the onset of diabetes preceded hospitaliza- tion (see Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes\u201d) (33,34). Hypoglyce- mia in hospitalized patients is categorized by blood glucose concentration and clinical correlates (Table 6.4) (35). Level 1 hypo- glycemia is de\ufb01ned as a glucose con- centration of 54\u201370 mg/dL (3.0\u20133.9 mmol/L). Level 2 hypoglycemia is de- \ufb01ned as a blood glucose concentration <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), which is typi- cally the threshold for neuroglycopenic",

Level 3 hypoglycemia is de- \ufb01ned as a clinical event characterized by altered mental and/or physical functioning that requires assistance from another per- son for recovery. Levels 2 and 3 require immediate correction of low blood glu- cose. Prompt treatment of level 1 hypo- glycemia can prevent progression to more signi\ufb01cant level 2 and level 3 hypoglycemia. Glycemic Targets In a landmark clinical trial conducted in a surgical intensive care unit, Van den Berghe et al. (36) demonstrated that an intensive intravenous insulin protocol with a tar- get glycemic range of 80\u2013110 mg/dL (4.4\u20136.1 mmol/L) reduced mortality by 40% compared with a standard approach targeting blood glucose of 180\u2013215 mg/dL (10\u201312 mmol/L) in critically ill hospitalized patients with recent surgery. This study provided robust evidence that active treat- ment to lower blood glucose in hospital- ized patients could have immediate bene\ufb01ts. However, a large, multicenter follow-up study in critically ill hospital- ized patients, the Normoglycemia in Inten- sive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) trial (37), led to a reconsideration of the optimal target range for glucose lower- ing in critical illness. In this trial, criti- cally ill patients randomized to intensive glycemic management (80\u2013110 mg/dL) derived no signi\ufb01cant treatment advan- tage compared with a group with more moderate glycemic targets (140\u2013180 mg/dL [7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L]) and had slightly but S268 Diabetes Care in the Hospital Diabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The intensively treated group had 10- to 15-fold greater rates of hypoglyce- mia, which may have contributed to the adverse outcomes noted. The \ufb01ndings from NICE-SUGAR are supported by sev- eral meta-analyses and a randomized con- trolled trial, some of which suggest that tight glycemic management increases mortality compared with more moder- ate glycemic targets and generally causes higher rates of hypoglycemia (38\u201340). Based on these results, insulin therapy should be initiated for the treatment of persistent hyperglycemia $180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) and targeted to a glucose range of 140\u2013180 mg/dL (7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L) for the majority of critically ill patients. Although not as well supported by data from randomized controlled trials, these recommendations have been extended to hospitalized patients without critical illness. More stringent goals, such as 110\u2013140 mg/dL (6.1\u20137.8 mmol/L), may be appropriate for selected patients (e.g., criti- cally ill postsurgical patients or patients with cardiac surgery) as long as they can be achieved without signi\ufb01cant hypogly- cemia (41\u201343). For inpatient management of hyperglycemia in noncritical care, the expert consensus recommends a target range of 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) for noncritically ill patients with \u201cnew\u201d hyperglycemia as well as people with known diabetes prior to admission. It has been found that fasting glucose levels <100 mg/dL are predictors of hypoglyce- mia within the next 24 h (44).

Clinical judgment combined with ongoing assessment of clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose meas- ures, illness severity, nutritional status, or concomitant medications that might af- fect glucose levels (e.g., glucocorticoids), may be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing (42). BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING In hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) glu- cose monitoring should be performed be- fore meals; in those not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h (33). More frequent POC blood glucose moni- toring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h is the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin. Safety standards for blood glucose monitoring that prohibit sharing lanceting devices, other testing materials, and needles are mandatory (45). The vast majority of hospital glucose monitoring is performed with FDA-approved prescription POC glucose monitoring sys- tems with and capillary blood taken from \ufb01nger sticks, similar to the process per- formed by outpatients for home blood glucose monitoring (46). POC blood glu- cose meters are not as accurate or as precise as laboratory glucose analyzers, and capillary blood glucose readings are subject to artifacts due to perfusion, edema, anemia/erythrocytosis, and sev- eral medications commonly used in the hospital (47) (Table 7.1).

The balance between analytic requirements (e.g., accuracy, precision, interference) and clinical re- quirements (rapidity, simplicity, point of care) has not been uniformly resolved (46,48), and most hospitals have arrived at their own policies to balance these param- eters. It is critically important that devices selected for in-hospital use, and the work\ufb02ow through which they are applied, have careful analysis of performance and reliability and ongoing quality assessments. Recent studies indicate that POC measures provide adequate information for usual practice, with only rare instances where care has been compromised (49,50). Best practice dictates that any glucose result that does not correlate with the pa- tient\u2019s clinical status should be con\ufb01rmed by measuring a serum sample in the clini- cal laboratory. Continuous Glucose Monitoring Real-time continuous glucose monitor- ing (CGM) provides frequent measure- ments of interstitial glucose levels and the direction and magnitude of glucose trends. Even though CGM has theoretical advantages over POC glucose monitoring in detecting and reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia, it has not been approved by the FDA for inpatient use. Some hospi- tals with established glucose management teams allow the use of CGM in selected people with diabetes on an individual ba- sis, mostly in noncritical care settings, pro- vided both the individual and the glucose management team are well educated in the use of this technology. CGM is not cur- rently approved for intensive care unit use due to accuracy concerns such as hypovo- lemia, hypoperfusion, and use of therapies such as vasopressor agents. During",

This approach has been helpful in that regard, as well as in minimizing the use of personal protec- tive equipment. The availability of data about the safe and effective use of CGM in the inpatient setting is evolving. Pre- liminary data suggest that CGM can sig- ni\ufb01cantly improve glycemic management and other hospital outcomes (57,60\u201363).

Noncritical Care Setting In most instances, insulin is the pre- ferred treatment for hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients. However, in certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to continue home therapies, including oral glucose-lowering medications (64,65). If oral medications are held in the hospital but will be reinstated after discharge, there should be a protocol for guiding resumption of home medications 1\u20132 days prior to discharge. For people taking insu- lin, several reports indicate that inpatient use of insulin pens is safe and may be as- sociated with improved nurse satisfaction compared with the use of insulin vials and syringes with safety protocols in place (66\u201368). Insulin pens have been the sub- ject of an FDA warning because of poten- tial blood-borne diseases if inadvertently shared with more than one person; the warning \u201cFor single patient use only\u201d should be rigorously followed using strict safety measures such as barcoding to prevent errors (69,70). Outside of critical care units, scheduled insulin orders are recommended to manage hyperglycemia in people with di- abetes. Orders for insulin analogs or hu- man insulin result in similar glycemic outcomes in the hospital setting (71). The use of subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals, or every 4\u20136 h if no meals are given or if the individual is receiving continuous enteral/parenteral nutrition, is indicated to correct or prevent hyperglycemia.

In people with diabetes with blood glucose <240 mg/dL, consider alterna- tives to basal-bolus therapy as discussed below (72,73). For individuals who are eating, insulin injections should align with meals. In such instances, POC glucose monitoring should be performed immediately before meals. If oral intake is inadequate, a safer procedure is administering pran- dial insulin immediately after eating, with the dose adjusted to be appropriate for the amount of carbohydrates ingested (71). A randomized controlled trial has shown that basal-bolus treatment improved glyce- mic outcomes and reduced hospital com- plications compared with a correction or supplemental insulin without basal insulin (formerly known as sliding scale) in general surgery for people with type 2 diabetes (74). Prolonged use of correction or sup- plemental insulin without basal insulin as the sole treatment of hyperglycemia is strongly discouraged in the inpatient setting, with the exception of people with type 2 diabetes in noncritical care with mild hyperglycemia (23,75,76). While there is evidence for using pre- mixed insulin formulations in the outpa- tient setting (77), an inpatient study of 70/30 NPH/regular insulin versus basal- bolus therapy showed comparable gly- cemic outcomes but signi\ufb01cantly increased hypoglycemia in the group receiving insulin mixtures (78).

Type 1 Diabetes For people with type 1 diabetes, dosing insulin based solely on premeal glucose levels does not account for basal insulin requirements or caloric intake, increasing the risk of both hypoglycemia and hyper- glycemia. Typically, basal insulin dosing is based on body weight, with some evi- dence that people with renal insuf\ufb01ciency should be treated with lower doses (79,80). An insulin schedule with basal and correction components is necessary for all hospitalized individuals with type 1 diabetes, even when taking nothing by mouth, with the addition of prandial insu- lin when eating. Transitioning From Intravenous to Subcutaneous Insulin When discontinuing intravenous insulin, a transition protocol is associated with less morbidity and lower costs of care (81,82) and is therefore recommended. A person with type 1 or type 2 diabetes being transitioned to a subcutaneous regimen should receive a dose of subcu- taneous basal insulin 2 h before the in- travenous infusion is discontinued. Prior to discontinuing an insulin infusion, initi- ation of subcutaneous basal insulin may help minimize hyperglycemia and avoid rebound hypoglycemia (83,84). The dose of basal insulin is best calculated on the basis of the insulin infusion rate during the last 6 h when stable glycemic goals were achieved (85).

Noninsulin Therapies The safety and ef\ufb01cacy of noninsulin glucose-lowering therapies in the hospi- tal setting is an area of active research (73,87\u201389). Several recent randomized trials have demonstrated the potential effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl pepti- dase 4 inhibitors in speci\ufb01c groups of hospitalized people with diabetes (90\u201393). However, an FDA bulletin states that health care professionals should consider discontinuing saxagliptin and alogliptin in people who develop heart failure (94). Sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors should be avoided in cases of severe illness, in people with ketonemia or ketonuria, and during prolonged fasting and surgical procedures (4). Until safety and ef\ufb01cacy are established, SGLT2 inhibi- tors are not recommended for routine in- hospital use for diabetes management, al- though they may be considered for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes who have or are at risk for heart failure (95). Furthermore, the FDA has warned that SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped 3 days before scheduled surgeries (4 days in the case of ertugli\ufb02ozin) (96).

C People with or without diabetes may experience hypoglycemia in the hospital setting. While hypoglycemia is associated with increased mortality (97), in many cases, it is a marker of an underlying disease rather than the cause of fatality. However, hypoglycemia is a severe con- sequence of dysregulated metabolism and/or diabetes treatment, and it is im- perative that it be minimized during hos- pitalization. Many episodes of inpatient hypoglycemia are preventable. Therefore, a hypoglycemia prevention and manage- ment protocol should be adopted and implemented by each hospital or hospi- tal system. A standardized hospital-wide, nurse-initiated hypoglycemia treatment protocol should be in place to immedi- ately address blood glucose levels of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (98,99). In addi- tion, individualized plans for preventing and treating hypoglycemia for each in- dividual should also be developed. An American Diabetes Association consensus statement recommends that an individ- ual\u2019s treatment plan be reviewed any time a blood glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) occurs, as such readings often predict subsequent level 3 hypo- glycemia. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be documented in the medical record and tracked (1,2).

A recent study describes acute kidney injury as an im- portant risk factor for hypoglycemia in the hospital (103), possibly as a result of decreased insulin clearance. Studies of \u201cbundled\u201d preventive therapies, includ- ing proactive surveillance of glycemic outliers and an interdisciplinary data- driven approach to glycemic management, showed that hypoglycemic episodes in the hospital could be prevented. Com- pared with baseline, two such studies found that hypoglycemic events fell by 56\u201380% (99,104,105). The Joint Commis- sion recommends that all hypoglycemic episodes be evaluated for a root cause and the episodes be aggregated and re- viewed to address systemic issues (31). In addition to errors with insulin treat- ment, iatrogenic hypoglycemia may be induced by a sudden reduction of cor- ticosteroid dose, reduced oral intake, emesis, inappropriate timing of short- or rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals, reduced infusion rate of intravenous dex- trose, unexpected interruption of enteral or parenteral feedings, delayed or missed blood glucose checks, and altered ability of the individual to report symptoms (106). Recent inpatient CGM studies show promise for CGM as an early warning system to alert of impending hypoglyce- mia, offering an opportunity to mitigate it before it happens (60\u201363).

Hospitals should be encouraged to develop policies and protocols to support inpatient use of individual- and hospital-owned diabe- tes technology and have expert staff available for safe implementation. Hos- pital information technology teams are beginning to integrate CGM data into the electronic health record. The ability to download and interpret diabetes de- vice data during hospitalization can in- form insulin dosing during hospitalization and care transitions (107). For more information on CGM, see Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology.\u201d Predictors of Hypoglycemia In people with diabetes in the ambulatory setting, it is well established that an epi- sode of severe hypoglycemia increases the risk for a subsequent event, partly because of impaired counterregulation (108,109). This relationship also holds true for people with diabetes in the in- patient setting. For example, in a study of hospitalized individuals treated for hyper- glycemia, 84% who had an episode of \u201csevere hypoglycemia\u201d (de\ufb01ned in the study as <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L]) had a preceding episode of hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) during the same admission (110). In another study of hypoglycemic episodes (de\ufb01ned in the study as <50 mg/dL [2.8 mmol/L]), 78% of patients were using basal insulin, with the incidence of hypoglycemia peaking between midnight and 6:00 A.M. Despite recognition of hypoglycemia, 75% of indi- viduals did not have their dose",

Recently, several groups have devel- oped algorithms to predict episodes of hypoglycemia in the inpatient setting (112,113). Models such as these are po- tentially important and, once validated for general use, could provide a valuable tool to reduce rates of hypoglycemia in the hospital. In one retrospective cohort study data, a fasting blood glucose of <100 mg/dL was shown to be a predic- tor of next-day hypoglycemia (44). MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY IN THE HOSPITAL The goals of medical nutrition therapy in the hospital are to provide adequate calories to meet metabolic demands, optimize glycemic outcomes, address per- sonal food preferences, and facilitate the creation of a discharge plan. The American Diabetes Association does not endorse any single meal plan or speci\ufb01ed percen- tages of macronutrients. Current nutrition recommendations advise individualization based on treatment goals, physiological parameters, and medication use. Consis- tent carbohydrate meal plans are pre- ferred by many hospitals as they facilitate matching the prandial insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrate given (114). Or- ders should also indicate that the meal delivery and nutritional insulin coverage should be coordinated, as their variabil- ity often creates the possibility of hyper- glycemic and hypoglycemic events (28). Many hospitals offer \u201cmeals on demand,\u201d where individuals may order meals from diabetesjournals.org/care Diabetes Care in the Hospital S271 \u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Finally, if the hospital food service sup- ports carbohydrate counting, this option should be made available to people with diabetes counting carbohydrates at home (115,116). SELF-MANAGEMENT IN THE HOSPITAL Diabetes self-management in the hospi- tal may be appropriate for speci\ufb01c indi- viduals who wish to continue to perform self-care while acutely ill (117,118). Can- didates include children with parental supervision, adolescents, and adults who successfully perform diabetes self- management at home and whose cogni- tive and physical skills needed to suc- cessfully self-administer insulin and perform glucose monitoring are not com- promised (9,119). In addition, they should have adequate oral intake, be pro\ufb01cient in carbohydrate estimation, take multiple daily insulin injections or use insulin pumps, have stable insulin requirements, and understand sick-day management. If self-management is supported, a policy should include a requirement that peo- ple with diabetes and the care team agree that self-management is appro- priate on a daily basis during hospitaliza- tion. Hospital personal medication policies may include guidance for people with diabetes who wish to take their own or hospital-dispensed diabetes medications during their hospital stay. A hospital pol- icy for personal medication may con- sider a pharmacy exception on a case- by-case basis along with the care team. Pharmacy must verify any home medi- cation and require a prescriber order for the individual to self-administer home or hospital-dispensed medication under the supervision of the registered nurse.

STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL SITUATIONS Enteral/Parenteral Feedings For individuals receiving enteral or par- enteral feedings who require insulin, the insulin orders should include cover- age of basal, prandial, and correctional needs (115,122,123). It is essential that people with type 1 diabetes continue to receive basal insulin even if feedings are discontinued. Most adults receiving basal insulin should continue with their basal dose, while the insulin dose for the total daily nutritional component may be calculated as 1 unit of insulin for every 10\u201315 g car- bohydrate in the enteral and parenteral formulas. Commercially available cans of enteral nutrition contain variable amounts of carbohydrates and may be infused at different rates. All of this must be consid- ered while calculating insulin doses to cover the nutritional component of en- teral nutrition (116). Giving NPH insulin two or three times daily (every 8 or 12 h) to cover individual requirements is a reasonable option. Adjustments in in- sulin doses should be made frequently. Correctional insulin should also be ad- ministered subcutaneously every 6 h with human regular insulin or",

If enteral nutrition is interrupted, a 10% dextrose infusion should be started im- mediately to prevent hypoglycemia and to allow time to select more appropriate insulin doses. For adults receiving enteral bolus feedings, approximately 1 unit of regular human insulin or rapid-acting insulin per 10\u201315 g carbohydrate should be given subcutaneously before each feeding. Cor- rectional insulin coverage should be added as needed before each feeding. In individuals receiving nocturnal tube feeding, NPH insulin administered with the initiation of the feeding represents a reasonable approach to cover this nutritional load. For individuals receiving continuous peripheral or central parenteral nutrition, human regular insulin may be added to the solution, particularly if >20 units of correctional insulin have been required in the past 24 h. A starting dose of 1 unit of human regular insulin for every 10 g dextrose has been recommended (115) and should be adjusted daily in the solution. Adding insulin to the parenteral nutrition bag is the safest way to prevent hypoglycemia if the parenteral nutrition is stopped or interrupted. Correctional insulin should be administered subcu- taneously to address any hyperglyce- mia. For full enteral/parenteral feeding guidance, please refer to review articles detailing this topic (122,124,125). Because continuous enteral or paren- teral nutrition results in a continuous postprandial state, efforts to bring blood glucose levels to below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) substantially increase the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients.

If left untreated, this hyperglycemia in- creases mortality and morbidity risk, e.g., infections and cardiovascular events. Glu- cocorticoid type and duration of action must be considered in determining appro- priate insulin treatments. Daily-ingested intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone reach peak plasma levels in 4\u20136 h (128) but have pharmacologic actions that can last through the day. Individuals placed on morning steroid therapy have disproportionate hypergly- cemia during the day but frequently reach target blood glucose levels over- night regardless of treatment (126). In subjects on once- or twice-daily steroids, administering intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is a standard approach. NPH is usually administered in addition to daily basal-bolus insulin or in addition to oral glucose-lowering medications. Because NPH action peaks at 4\u20136 h after administration, it is recommended to administer it con- comitantly with intermediate-acting ste- roids (129). For long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone and multidose or continuous glucocorticoid use, long-acting basal insulin may be required to manage fasting blood glucose levels (65,130). For higher doses of glucocorticoids, increasing doses of prandial (if eating) and correc- tional insulin, sometimes as much as 40\u201360% or more, are often needed in addition to basal insulin (72,131,132).

Whatever insulin orders are initiated, daily adjustments based on levels of glycemia and anticipated changes in type, doses, and duration of glucocorti- coids, along with POC blood glucose moni- toring, are critical to reducing rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Perioperative Care It is estimated that up to 20% of general surgery patients have diabetes, and 23\u2013 60% have prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. Surgical stress and counterre- gulatory hormone release increase the risk of hyperglycemia as well as mortal- ity, infection, and length of stay (134). There is little data available to guide care of people with diabetes through the perioperative period. To reduce sur- gical risk in people with diabetes, some institutions have A1C cutoffs for elective surgeries, and some have developed op- timization programs to lower A1C before surgery (135). The following approach (136\u2013138) may be considered: 1. A preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabe- tes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with auto- nomic neuropathy or renal failure. 2. The A1C target for elective surgeries should be <8% (63.9 mmol/L) when- ever possible (139,140). 3. The target range for blood glucose in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) (139) within 4 h of the surgery (1). 4.

There are no data on the use and/or in\ufb02uence of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists or ultra-long-acting insulin analogs on glycemia in periop- erative care. A recent review concluded that peri- operative glycemic targets tighter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) did not improve outcomes and was asso- ciated with more hypoglycemia (137); therefore, in general, stricter glycemic targets are not advised. Evidence from a recent study indicates that compared with usual dosing, a reduction of insulin given the evening before surgery by \u000125% was more likely to achieve peri- operative blood glucose levels in the target range with a lower risk for hy- poglycemia (141). In noncardiac general surgery patients, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid- acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been associated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of periopera- tive complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or rapid- acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing (74,134,142).

Management goals include restora- tion of circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, resolution of hyperglycemia, and correction of electrolyte imbalance and acidosis. It is also essential to treat any correctable underlying cause of DKA, such as sepsis, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In critically ill and mentally obtunded individuals with DKA or hyperosmolar hy- perglycemia, continuous intravenous in- sulin is the standard of care. Successful transition from intravenous to subcuta- neous insulin requires administration of basal insulin 2\u20134 h before the intra- venous insulin is stopped to prevent recurrence of ketoacidosis and rebound hyperglycemia (143). There is no signi\ufb01- cant difference in outcomes for intra- venous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive \ufb02uid manage- ment for treating mild or moderate DKA (146). Individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous insulin in the emergency department or step-down units (147). This approach may be safer and more cost-effective than treatment with intra- venous insulin. If subcutaneous insulin administration is used, it is important to provide an adequate \ufb02uid replacement, frequent POC blood glucose monitoring, treatment of any concurrent infections, and appropriate follow-up to avoid re- current DKA. Several studies have shown that the use of bicarbonate in patients with DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to dis- charge, and its use is generally not rec- ommended (148).

TRANSITION FROM THE HOSPITAL TO THE AMBULATORY SETTING Recommendation 16.11 A structured discharge plan should be tailored to the in- dividual with diabetes. B A structured discharge plan tailored to the individual may reduce the length of hospital stay and readmission rates and increase satisfaction with the hospital experience (150). Multiple strategies are key, including diabetes education prior to discharge, diabetes medication rec- onciliation with attention to access, and scheduled virtual and/or face-to-face follow-up visits after discharge. Discharge planning should begin at admission and be updated as individual needs change (3,151). The transition from the acute care setting presents risks for all people with diabetes. Individuals may be discharged to varied settings, including home (with or without visiting nurse services), assisted living, rehabilitation, or skilled nursing facilities. For individuals discharged to home or assisted living, the optimal dis- charge plan will need to consider diabe- tes type and severity, effects of the illness on blood glucose levels, and the individual\u2019s capabilities and preferences (29,152,153).

If glycemic medications are changed or glucose management is not optimal at discharge, an earlier appointment (in 1\u20132 weeks) is preferred, and frequent contact may be needed to avoid hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. A discharge algorithm for glycemic medication adjustment based on admission A1C, diabetes medications before admission, and insulin usage during hospitalization was found use- ful to guide treatment decisions and signi\ufb01cantly improved A1C after dis- charge (6). If an A1C from the prior 3 months is unavailable, measuring the A1C in all people with diabetes or hy- perglycemia admitted to the hospital is recommended upon admission. Clear communication with outpatient health care professionals directly or via hospital discharge summaries facilitates safe transitions to outpatient care.

Of people with diabetes who are hospitalized, 30% have two or more hospital stays, and these admis- sions account for over 50% of hospital costs for diabetes (156). Factors contrib- uting to readmission include male sex, longer duration of prior hospitalization, number of previous hospitalizations, number and severity of comorbidities, and lower socioeconomic and/or educa- tional status; scheduled home health visits and timely ambulatory follow-up care reduce readmission rates (151,155). While there is no standard to prevent re- admissions, several successful strate- gies have been reported (151). These include targeting ketosis-prone people with type 1 diabetes (157), insulin treat- ment of individuals with admission A1C >9% (75 mmol/mol) (158), and the use of a transitional care model (159). For people with diabetic kidney disease, col- laborative patient-centered medical homes may decrease risk-adjusted re- admission rates (160). A 2018 published algorithm based on demographic and clinical characteristics of people with di- abetes had only moderate predictive power but identi\ufb01ed a promising future strategy (161).

    "text": "a healthy and productive life. A strategic goal of the ADA is for more children and adults with diabetes to live free from the burden of discrimination. The ADA is also focused on making sure cost is not a barrier to successful diabetes management. One tactic for achieving these goals has been to implement the ADA Standards of Care through advocacy-oriented position statements. The ADA publishes evidence-based, peer-reviewed statements on topics such as diabetes and employment, diabetes and driving, insulin access and affordability, and diabetes management in certain settings such as schools, childcare programs, and detention facilities. In addition to the ADA\u2019s clinical documents, these advocacy statements are important tools in educating schools, employ- ers, licensing agencies, policy makers, and others about the intersection of diabetes man- agement and the law and for providing scienti\ufb01cally supported policy recommendations. ADVOCACY STATEMENTS The following is a partial list of advocacy statements ordered by publication date, with the most recent statement appearing \ufb01rst. A comprehensive list of advocacy state- ments is available at professional.diabetes.org/content/key-statements-and-reports. Insulin Access and Affordability The ADA\u2019s Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group compiled public informa- tion and convened a series of meetings with stakeholders throughout the insulin supply chain to learn how each entity affects the cost of insulin for the consumer. Their conclusions and recommendations are published in an ADA statement (1).

Refer to the published ADA position statement for information on young children aged <6 years in set- tings such as daycare centers, preschools, camps, and other programs (3). Diabetes and Driving People with diabetes who wish to oper- ate motor vehicles are subject to various licensing requirements applied by both state and federal jurisdictions. For an overview of existing licensing rules for people with diabetes, factors that impact driving for this population, and general guidelines for assessing driver \ufb01tness and determining appropriate licensing restric- tions, refer to the published ADA position statement (4).

In obese individuals, the amount of nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, proinflammatory markers, and other substances that are involved in the development of insulin resistance, is increased. The pathogenesis in the development of diabetes is based on the fact that the \u03b2-islet cells of",

The development of diabetes becomes more inevitable if the failure of \u03b2-islet cells of the pancreas is accompanied by insulin resistance. Weight gain and body mass are central to the formation and rising incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This literature review will demonstrate the facts that link obesity with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. In conclusion, new approaches in managing and preventing diabetes in obese individuals must be studied and investigated based on the facts. Keywords: diabetes mellitus, obesity, insulin resistance Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disorder that can alter carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. It is caused by the absence of insulin secretion due to either the progressive or marked inability of the \u03b2-Langerhans islet cells of the pancreas to produce insulin, or due to defects in insulin uptake in the peripheral tissue. DM is broadly classified under two categories, which include type 1 and type 2 diabetes.1 Type 1 diabetes occurs most commonly in children, but it can sometimes also appear in adult age groups, particularly in those in their late thirties and early forties. Patients with type 1 diabetes are generally not obese and frequently present with an emergency status known as diabetes ketoacidosis.2 The etiology of type 1 diabetes can be explained by damage to the pancreatic cells due to environmental or infectious agents. In individuals who are susceptible to genetic alterations, the immune system is triggered to",

Furthermore, another study has proved that vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes may predict all causes of mortality.7 Type 2 diabetes has a different pathophysiology and etiology as compared to type 1 diabetes. The existence of many new factors \u2013 for example, the increased prevalence of obesity among all age groups and both sex physical inactiv\u00ad ity, poor diet, and urbanization \u2013 means that the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is rising.8 This finding is significant because it will allow health planners to make rational plans and reallocate health resources accordingly.9 Type 2 diabetes is described as a combination of low amounts of insulin production from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and peripheral insulin resistance.10 Insulin resistance leads to elevated fatty acids in the plasma, causing decreased glu\u00ad cose transport into the muscle cells, as well as increased fat breakdown, subsequently leading to elevated hepatic glucose production. \u00adInsulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction must occur simultaneously for type 2 diabetes to develop. Anyone who is overweight and/or obese has some kind of insulin resistance, but diabetes only develops in those individuals who lack sufficient insulin secretion to match the degree of insulin resistance. Insulin in those people may be high, yet it is not enough to normalize the level of glycemia.11 Dysfunction of \u03b2-cells is a",

After the progression from normal glucose tolerance to abnormal glucose tolerance, postprandial blood glucose levels increase initially. There\u00ad after, fasting hyperglycemia may develop as the suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis fails.12 Despite the fact that the pathophysiology of diabetes differs between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, most of the complications are similar, which may include macrovascular and microvascular complications.13 Abnormal glycemia appears to contribute to microvascular and metabolic complications. However, macrovascular com\u00ad plications appear to be unrelated to glycemic abnormalities. Insulin resistance with lipid abnormalities (ie, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, and high levels of low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides), thrombotic abnormalities, as well as atherosclerotic risk factors (for example, smoking, family history, and hypertension) determine the cardiovas\u00ad cular risk in a patient. Cardiovascular risk is associated with the development of insulin resistance even before frank hyperglycemia exists. A hypothesis of complications called the \u201cticking clock\u201d developed by Haffner et al in 1999 showed that the onset of hyperglycemia puts one at risk for developing macrovascular complications at an earlier point, perhaps at the onset of insulin resistance and before hyperglycemia.14 Obesity Overweight and obesity are defined by an excess accumula\u00ad tion of adipose tissue to an extent that impairs both physical and psychosocial health and well-being.15 Obesity is con\u00ad sidered a health disaster in both developed and developing countries.16 The prevalence is escalating significantly in many nations worldwide.

Obesity and type 1 diabetes The rising incidence of type 2 diabetes among children and adults is related to the epidemic of obesity. A similar etiology is also responsible for a similar increase in type 1 diabetes.17 While the underling pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, which is autoimmune in nature, continues to be investigated and studied, the exact mechanism causing the rise in the incidence of type 1 diabetes remains unclear, particularly in young age groups. The DIAMOND (Diabetes Mondiale) study,18 which collected data on childhood diabetes from 112 centers around the world, demonstrated an approximate 2.8% annual increase in type 1 diabetes over the period from 1989\u20132000. The etiology of type 1 diabetes, according to twin studies, indicates a joint contribution of environmental and genetic \u00adfactors.8 Furthermore, the importance of environmental factors in the etiology of diabetes is indicated by a sig\u00ad nificant rise in type 1 diabetes incidence in immigrants from lower to higher incidence regions. Multiple triggers for the development of type 1 diabetes have been investigated, \u00adincluding short-\u00adduration or the absence of breastfeeding, exposure to cow\u2019s milk protein, and exposure to some kind of infection such as enterovirus or rubella. However, none of these triggering factors has been shown to be the definitive cause.19 The association between type 1 diabetes and weight gain was first investigated by Baum et al20 in 1975.

There is an inverse relationship between body mass index and age at diagnosis. Furthermore, as young children gain more weight, diabetes can be diagnosed earlier. This is explained by the fact that more weight accelerates insulin resistance, leading to the development of type 1 diabetes in individuals who are predisposed genetically to diabetes. \u00adFollowing this study, many papers were published support\u00ad ing Wilkin\u2019s accelerator hypotheses. One study conducted in the United States in 2003 showed a significant increase in the prevalence of being overweight in children with type 1 diabetes, from 12.6% in the period 1979\u20131989 to 36.8% in the period 1990\u20131998. To date, the exact mechanism and relationship between type 1 diabetes and obesity remains inconclusive and needs further explanation.21 Obesity and type 2 diabetes The increased prevalence of obesity these days has drawn attention to the worldwide significance of this problem.17 In the US, approximately two-thirds of the adult popula\u00ad tion is considered to be overweight or obese. Similar trends are being noticed worldwide.22 Obesity is linked to many medical, psychological, and social conditions, the most devastating of which may be type 2 diabetes. At the start of this century, 171 million people were estimated to have type 2 diabetes, and this figure is expected to increase to 360 million by 2030.23 Both type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with insulin resistance.

Pancreatic \u03b2-cells of the islet of Langerhans release adequate amounts of insulin that are sufficient to overcome insulin level reduc\u00ad tions under normal circumstances, thus maintaining normal glucose tolerance.11 Throughout the natural history of type 2 diabetes, endothelial dysfunction is accompanied with obesity/ insulin resistance in diabetes and prediabetes conditions (this includes people with impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose). In order to develop insulin resis\u00ad tance and obesity, thereby causing type 2 diabetes, \u03b2-cells should not be able to compensate fully for decreased insulin sensitivity. The nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) that are secreted from adipose tissue in obese people may lead to the hypothesis that insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction are most likely linked.24 Obesity and insulin resistance Insulin sensitivity fluctuation occurs across the natural life cycle. For example, insulin resistance is noticed during puberty, in pregnancy, and during the aging process.25 In addition, lifestyle variations, such as increased carbohy\u00ad drate intake and increased physical activity, are associated with insulin sensitivity fluctuations.10 Obesity is considered the most important factor in the development of metabolic diseases. Adipose tissue affects metabolism by secreting hormones, glycerol, and other substances including leptin, cytokines, adiponectin, and proinflammatory substances, and by releasing NEFAs. In obese individuals, the secretion of these substances will be increased.25 The cornerstone factor affecting insulin insensitivity is the release of NEFAs. Increased release of NEFAs is observed in type 2 diabetes and in obesity, and it is associated with insulin",

Conversely, when the level of plasma NEFA decreases, as in the case with antilipolytic agent use, peripheral insulin uptake and glucose monitoring will be improved.27 Insulin sensitivity is determined by another critical factor, which is body fat distribution. Insulin resistance is associated with body mass index at any degree of weight gain. Insulin sensitivity also differs completely in lean individuals because of differences in body fat distribution. Individuals whose fat distribution is more peripheral have more insulin sensitivity than do individuals whose fat distribution is more central (ie, in the abdomen and chest area).25 Differences in adipose tissue distribution help explain, to some extent, how the metabolic effects of subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat differ. Intra-abdominal fat is more related to the genes that secrete proteins and the specific types of proteins responsible for the production of energy. Adiponectin secretion by omental adipocytes is larger than the amount secreted by subcutaneous-derived adipocytes. Moreover, the quantity secreted from these omental adipo\u00ad cytes is negatively associated with increased body weight.26 The secretion of NEFAs to different tissue may be affected by their source. Furthermore, abdominal fat is considered more lipolytic than subcutaneous fat, and it also does not respond easily to the antilipolytic action of insulin, which makes intra- abdominal fat more important in causing insulin resistance, and thus diabetes.27,28 Marcial et al29 further explained the molecular mecha\u00ad nisms of insulin resistance, inflammation,",

Insulin resistance is indeed an important factor in disease process. Fat storage and mobilization are other important factors causing insulin resistance. Obesity and \u03b2-cell dysfunction \u03b2-cells play a vital role in regulating insulin release, despite their fragility. The quantity of insulin released by \u03b2-cells fluctuates and changes according to the quantity, nature, and route of administration of the stimulus. Therefore, \u03b2-cells play a very important role in ensuring that in healthy subjects, concentrations of blood glucose are stable within a relatively normal physiological range. In obesity, insulin sensitivity, as well as the modulation of \u03b2-cell function, decreases.30 Insulin-resistant individuals, whether slim or fat, have more insulin responses and lower hepatic insulin clearance than those who are insulin sensitive. In a normal healthy subject, there is a continuous feedback relationship between the \u03b2-cells and the insulin-sensitive tissues.10 If the adipose tissue, liver, and muscles demand glucose, this will lead to increased insulin supply by the \u03b2-cells. If the glucose levels require stability, changes in insulin sensitivity must be matched by a relatively opposite change in circulating insulin levels. Failure of this process to take place results in a deregulation of glucose levels and the development of DM. If the \u03b2-cells are healthy, there is an adaptive response to insulin resistance, which leads to the maintenance of normal levels of glucose. By contrast, when pancreatic \u03b2-cells",

According to literature, when \u03b2-cell dysfunction causes inadequate insulin secretion, fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose will elevate.31 Subsequently, the decreased efficiency of hepatic and muscle glucose uptake will occur, with the absence or incomplete inhi\u00ad bition of liver glucose production. Further increases in blood glucose levels will lead to disease severity through glucotoxic effects on the pancreatic \u03b2-cells and negative effects on insulin uptake and peripheral tissue sensitivity.31 Conversely, in healthy subjects, elevating their blood glucose levels for 20 hours or more has an absolutely inverse action, because it will lead to enhanced \u03b2-cell function capacity and improve peripheral insulin uptake.16 These facts explain that a genetic risk factor is necessary for the occurrence of \u03b2-cell function impairment. The progression of time, as well as a pre-existing genetic abnormality in insulin secretion and a subsequently continuous elevation of blood glucose levels, lead to complete \u03b2-cell failure.24 A second factor that might contribute to a continuous loss of function of \u03b2-cells is increasing plasma NEFA \u00adlevels. Despite the fact that NEFAs play a major role in insulin release, the continuous exposure to NEFAs is related to sig\u00ad nificant malfunction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pathways and reduced insulin biosynthesis.

The effect of lipotoxic increases in plasma NEFA levels and the rise of glucose levels might produce a more harmful effect known as glucolipotoxicity.33,34 Conclusion Diabetes and obesity are chronic disorders that are on the rise worldwide. Body mass index has a strong relationship to diabetes and insulin resistance. In an obese individual, the amount of NEFA, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, proinflam\u00ad matory substances, and other substances that are involved in the development of insulin resistance are increased. Insulin resistance with impairment of \u03b2-cell function leads to the development of diabetes. Gaining weight in early life is associated with the development of type 1 diabetes. NEFA is a cornerstone in the development of insulin resistance and in the impairment of \u03b2-cell function. New approaches in managing and preventing diabetes in obese individuals must be studied and investigated based on these facts. Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.

In individuals who are obese, higher amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, and pro-inflammatory cytokines that could participate in the development of insulin resis\u00ad tance are released by adipose tissue. Besides, endoplasmic reticulum stress, adipose tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress, lipodystrophy, and genetic background have a role in insulin resistance. However, no effective drug therapy was developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus targeting these physiological factors. This is might be due to a lack of agreement on the comprehensive mechanism of insulin resistance. Therefore, this review assesses the cellular components of each physiologic and pathophysiologic factors that are involved in obesity associated insulin resistance, and may encourage further drug development in this field. Keywords: obesity, insulin, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus Introduction Insulin is a hormone secreted by \u03b2 cells of islets of Langerhans, controls the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats by stimulating the absorption of molecules like glucose from the blood into fat, skeletal muscle cell, and liver.1 A reduction in insulin signaling primarily in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/ phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) axis triggers insulin",

On the other hand, diabetes mellitus is a complex chronic illness manifested by a high level of blood glucose or hyperglycemia, resulting from deficiencies in insulin secretion, action, or both.5 Obesity could cause chronic low-grade systemic and local inflammation that leads to the emergence of insulin resistance linked diabetes mellitus even though the mechanism is not clear.3,6 In addition, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can contribute to the development of obesity.6 Therefore, the objective of this review is to high\u00ad light the mechanisms of obesityassociated insulin resistance in T2DM through induction of inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), aging, hypoxia, and change in genetic makeup. Because understanding the impairment of insulin signaling which is related to obesity-induced diabetes may lead to better pharmacological strategies not only for the treatment of but also for the prevention of obesity and T2DM.

    "text": "Mechanisms of Obesity Induced- Insulin Resistance Obesity escalates the pathogenesis of T2DM through sti\u00ad mulation of insulin resistance. T2DM treatment has been restricted by little understanding of insulin resistance. However, several studies described the association between mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, hyper\u00ad insulinemia, and lipotoxicity with insulin resistance.7 Endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, genetic background, aging, hypoxia, and lipodystrophy are also stated in the pathogenesis of T2DM through induction of insulin resistance. Nevertheless, none of those concepts has led to the discovery of effective drugs for T2DM. The reason might be lack of agreement for cross-linked mechanisms of insulin resistance in T2DM.7 In the follow\u00ad ing sections, different physiological changes that are involved in obesity-associated insulin resistance will be discussed in part. Inflammation-Induced Insulin Resistance Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or an increased number of white blood cells in the blood or tissue are described by inflammation. Overstimulation of inflammatory process frequently leads to various abnorm\u00ad alities such as organ dysfunction and tissue injury. Obesity might cause chronic and low-grade inflammation that is involved in T2DM. In addition, adipose-specific cytokines (leptin, adiponectin, and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrotic factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) are secreted by visceral adipocytes. An elevated amount of adipose tissue draining into the portal vein, chemokines, and IL-6 production can induce liver and systemic insulin resistance.7,8 Moreover, visceral adipose depot and adipocyte size in humans are also related to insulin resistance.8 The predis\u00ad position of visceral adipose tissue for elevated inflamma\u00ad tion and the subsequent secretion of cytokines",

The levels of the macrophage- derived apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage protein that stimulates lipolysis in adipose tissue and responsible for local recruitment of adipose tissue macrophages are also increased with obesity.6,9 Furthermore, saturated fatty acids (FAs), glucose, and changes in gut microbiota have been considered as triggers of metabolic inflammation through the stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as; toll-like receptors (TLR), nucleotide oli\u00ad gomerization domain (NOD), and inflammasome.10,11 These eventually increase pro-inflammatory cytokines pro\u00ad duction and immune cell recruitment like T lymphocytes and macrophages in metabolic tissues. These pro-inflam\u00ad matory cytokines activate numerous kinases that interfere with insulin signaling and insulin action in adipocytes and hepatocyte.12 Different studies reported that drugs that suppress inflammation improve insulin sensitivity and enhance glucose regulation in T2DM insulin-resistant patients.13,14 For instance, salsalate, TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (eta\u00ad nercept, infliximab, adalimumab), IL-1\u03b2 antagonists like canakinumab, thiazolidinediones, and metformin are found to be anti-diabetes drugs with anti-inflammatory properties.14 Toll-Like Receptors in Insulin Resistance Toll-like receptors (TLR) are found under the family of PRRs play an indispensable function in innate immunity and identify tissue injury by the danger-associated mole\u00ad cular patterns. Studies reported that, among the different types of TLR, TLR2 and TLR4 have a role in inflamma\u00ad tion-associated insulin resistance during obesity.15,16 In obese mice and humans with diabetes, the expression of TLR4 in adipocytes, hepatocytes, muscles, and in the hypothalamus is increased and negatively affects insulin sensitivity.15 Another study also revealed that, during obe\u00ad",

Pharmacological activation of PGC-1\u03b1 is thought to result in health benefits. Nevertheless, this notion has been chal\u00ad lenged by growing evidence indicating that insulin resis\u00ad tance is increased when PGC-1\u03b1 is well beyond normal physiological limits.21 Endocrine Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance Energy storage depots for triglycerides synthesis is the essential role of adipocytes. They also act as endocrine cells, thereby secrete many peptide hormones and cyto\u00ad kines such as TNF-\u03b1, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1, which involves maintaining the level of angiotensinogen and its proteolytic product that controls vasoconstriction; and leptin, which participates in energy mobilization.22 In addition, active steroid hormones, including estrogen and cortisol can be produced by adipose tissue. Over such produced molecules, adipocytes retain the capacity to per\u00ad form their local functions and systemic metabolism in different organs like muscle, brain, liver, gonads, \u03b2-cells, lymphoid organs, and blood vessels. This assumption increases several possibilities for the further association between adipocyte function/mass and insulin resistance.22 For instance, in the T2DM mouse model, leptin enhanced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.23 Impaired leptin",

Increased leptin signaling can there\u00ad fore be a focus for therapies aimed at raising adiponectin expression, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving the cardiometabolic profile of obesity.24 Adipokines Role in Insulin Resistance Patients with T2DM and insulin resistance often exhibit signs of impaired metabolism, deposition, and concentra\u00ad tion of lipids in the skeletal muscle and blood.25 An abundance of free FAs in the plasma reduces insulin-regu\u00ad lated glucose metabolism, whereas a low level of lipid in the plasma enhances insulin function in the adipocytes, liver and skeletal muscle cells. Increasing plasma FAs in humans and rodents reduce insulin activation of IRS-1- linked PI-3K activity in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance associated with lipid has also been shown to be linked to defects in translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4).26 In addition, various adipokines (such as adi\u00ad ponectin, TNF-\u03b1, resistin, and IL) are involved in this disease state.27 Thus, an increase in the level of adiponec\u00ad tin enhances insulin sensitivity while resistin exhibits insu\u00ad lin-antagonistic effects. Resistin induces insulin resistance through inhibition of glucose transport in vitro and increases hepatic glucose production and fasting blood glucose concentrations in vivo.26 A study found that tre\u00ad lagliptin succinate reduced the content of resistance secreted by fat cells, suggesting that trelagliptin can reduce insulin resistance in fat cells.28 Neural Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance Studies revealed that our brain receives information from insulin and leptin, the transducer of adiposity signals, and integrates this input with signals from",

Peripheral and brain IRs are very crucial for normal insulin function, even though glucose homeostasis in mice with reduced hepatic IRs is altered by the central administration of insulin. Moreover, hypothalamic IRs function inhibition results in impaired hepatic glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Interestingly, leptin and insulin both enhance the expres\u00ad sion of suppressor of cytokine signals-3 (SOCS-3) and sensitivity to both leptin and insulin is increased in mice with reduced SOCS-3 neuronal expression.31 Excessive and Ectopic Lipid Deposition Induced Insulin Resistance The storage capacity of single adipocytes is limited, although they have a highly advanced ability to sequester fat.32,33 Following a short-term high-fat diet enlarged adi\u00ad pocytes trigger insulin resistance in the absence of much Dovepress Wondmkun Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2020:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress 3613",

This might be jus\u00ad tified as, excessive and ectopic lipid accumulation in adi\u00ad pocytes, liver, muscle, and outside may cause insulin resistance through metabolically toxic product formation. For instance, ceramide production has been increased by saturated FAs, which in return contributes to insulin resistance.34,35 In addition, the level of hepatic diacylglycerol shows a strong association with systemic insulin resistance, espe\u00ad cially in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These lipids may activate signaling pathways that negatively impact insulin signal transduction like one or more of the protein kinase C proteins. Incomplete FA oxidation products may also affect the steps in the insulin signaling cascade or the pathways it controls.35 Genetic Factors Related Insulin Resistance Not only insulin receptors and IRS-1 gene polymorphisms affect insulin signals, but also polymorphisms of other genes such as; uncoupling protein gene, \u03b23 of the adrener\u00ad gic receptor gene and GLUT-4 gene associated with visc\u00ad eral obesity may promote insulin resistance.36 A study revealed that T2DM patients and their relatives showed reduced total-body glucose disposal stimulation by insulin compared to control subjects. This glucose disposal impairment was mainly associated with the reduction in insulin-mediated storage of glucose in the form of glyco\u00ad gen. The rate of total-body glucose disposal in subjects with normal fasting glucose concentrations is also affected by the levels of GLUT-4 mRNA and GLUT-4 protein.37 Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Induced Insulin Resistance Study revealed that ER stress",

Enhanced unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen may be caused by the depletion of calcium stores from the ER. The presence of a high level of misfolded proteins results in the activation of signaling pathways to restore homeostasis and may lead to insulin resistance.38 Adipose Tissue Hypoxia-Induced Insulin Resistance Studies showed that, in obese animals, hypoxia response in adipose tissue is common. The results of most studies on adipose tissue hypoxia have revealed the presence of a strong association between adipose tissue hypoxia (ATH) and major chronic disorders like obesity patho\u00ad genesis. ATH may stimulate cellular mechanisms for leptin elevation, mitochondrial dysfunction, macrophage infiltration, chronic inflammation, adiponectin reduction, ER stress, and adipocyte death in obese individuals.39 In addition, inhibition of adipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis by hypoxia may be a new mechanism for elevated FAs in the blood during obesity. Therefore, ATH may represent a combined cellular mechanism for many metabolic disorders and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Studies in mice reveal that obesity increases reactive oxygen species formation in fat cells, shortens telomeres, and eventually results in inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor, inflammation, and the elevation of insulin resistance.42 Inflammation and insulin resistance in adi\u00ad pose tissue is increased by transgenic overexpression of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (Cdkn1a). In a similar study, p53 which is derived from adipocytes and macrophages contributes to adipose tissue aging in obese animals. This is because p53 is activated in response to shortened telomeres in aging cells.

If not available, fasting plasma glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) Pharmacological treatment Metformin is recommended as the first-line medicine in the treatment of diabetes. Sulfonylurea is recommended as the second-line treatment, and human insulin as the third-line treatment. Control of blood pressure and blood lipids Hypertension treatment is indicated when SBP \u2265130 and/or DBP \u226580. Statins are recommended for all people with type 2 diabetes older than 40 years, but only if this does not negatively impact access to glucose-lowering and blood pressure - lowering medication. FOLLOWUP Monitoring glycaemic control o When diabetes is diagnosed, monitor glycaemic control every three months until diabetes is controlled, then every six months after that. o HbA1c is the most accurate measurement of long-term glycaemic control and represents the average blood glucose over the previous two to three months. HbA1c < 7% is generally considered to be adequate glycaemic control. In people with frequent severe hypoglycaemia, severe complications and low life-expectancy, the goal for HbA1c could be relaxed, e.g. to<8%. o Fasting plasma glucose (FPG<7.0mmol/l or <125 mg/dl) can also be used to monitor control when HbA1c testing is not available.",

    "text": "Acute complications of Diabetes HYPOGLYCAEMIA Hypoglycaemia (abnormally low blood glucose) is a frequent iatrogenic complication in diabetic patients, occurring particularly in patients receiving sulfonylurea or insulin. It can cause loss of consciousness and coma and is potentially life-threatening. There is no universally agreed plasma glucose cut-off point for hypoglycaemia as symptoms and signs can occur at different thresholds. It is most frequently defined at plasma glucose of <3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) when it should be managed even if there are no symptoms and signs. Management of hypolycaemic emergencies Conscious patient: If the patient is able to eat and drink: \u2022 Give oral carbohydrate that contains 15-20 g of rapidly absorbing forms of glucose (sugar-sweetened soft drink, 1-2 teaspoons of sugar, 5-6 hard candy, cup of milk). \u2022 Plasma glucose levels typically increase by 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) within ~15 minutes; repeat the treatment if hypoglycaemia persists Unconscious patient: \u2022 Unconscious patients, those with plasma glucose <=2.8mmol/l (50mg/dl) and those unable to ingest drink should be given hypertonic glucose (dextrose) intravenously (20 \u2013 50 ml of 50% glucose over 1-3 minutes. If this concentration is not available, substitute with any hypertonic glucose solution \u2022 Food should be provided as soon as the patient is able to ingest food safely \u2022 Discuss hypoglycaemia risk factors with the patient (skipping meals, physical activity more intense than usual, alcohol ingestion) and adjust medication if necessary HYPERGLYCAEMIA Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) are life-threatening conditions with somewhat different features.

Race: people from certain racial backgrounds are found to have a higher risk of developing diabetes, although the reason is not known. Overweight/obesity: being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue one has, the more resistant the cells become to insulin. However, one does not have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. Inadequate physical activity: the less active one is, the more likely one is to develop type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps one control weight, use glucose as energy and increase the sensitivity of the cells to insulin. Unhealthy diet: a diet rich in calories, saturated fats and sugar, and low in fibre can lead to an increase in body weight and thereby increase the risk for developing diabetes. Having high blood pressure or a high lipid level also puts a person at risk of developing diabetes.

In the South-East Asia (SEA) Region, nearly 71 million were estimated to be living with diabetes in 2010 and an \u2022\u2022 equal number had impaired glucose tolerance. Nearly 3.4 million people globally and 1 million in SEA Region die from consequences of high blood sugar every \u2022\u2022 year. Diabetes exacerbates major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), malaria and HIV/AIDS. People with \u2022\u2022 diabetes are three times more likely to develop TB when infected and approximately 15% of TB globally is thought to be due to diabetes. What is diabetes? Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when blood glucose levels remain above normal limits. This happens if the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Type 1 diabetes is due to deficient insulin production while Type 2 diabetes results from the body\u2019s ineffective use of insulin. Over 90% of individuals with diabetes around the world have Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is the type of diabetes that is first recognized during pregnancy. What are the causes/risk factors for diabetes? The causes of Type 1 diabetes, while not known, may be diverse such as autoimmune, genetic or environmental. \u2022\u2022 Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes are overweight/obesity, family history of diabetes, tobacco use, excess alcohol \u2022\u2022 intake, prior history of",

Type 1 diabetes: Symptoms include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive \u2022\u2022 thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, very dry skin, vision changes and fatigue. Type 2 diabetes: Symptoms may be similar to those of Type 1 diabetes, but \u2022\u2022 are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, once complications have already arisen. Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are intermediate conditions and risk categories for future development of diabetes. What are the complications of diabetes? Raised blood sugar due to uncontrolled diabetes leads to serious damage to many of the body\u2019s systems over time. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as a result of long-term accumulated damage to small blood vessels in the retina. Diabetic neuropathy in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers and eventual limb amputation. Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failure.

Early diagnosis can be accomplished through blood testing, such as fasting or random blood glucose test, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test. What is the treatment for diabetes? Diabetes treatment involves lowering blood glucose and overall reduction in risk factors for diabetic complications, such as control of blood pressure and blood lipids. This requires lifelong care and management. Quitting tobacco use is important to avoid complications. Healthy eating, physical activity and monitoring blood glucose levels is required. In addition oral medication or insulin, or both are needed to control blood glucose levels. What can be done to prevent and control diabetes?

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the global burden of diabetes at 135 million cases in 1995, in a worldwide adult population of under 4 billion, and has projected that there will be 299 million cases by the year 2025. Although WHO recently accorded priority status to diabetes mellitus, many public health planners remain largely unaware of its magnitude and the seriousness of its complications. Of equal consequence, is the increasing prevalence of the disease and the long-term cost of therapy for both patients and the health sector, and its cost to nations in economic terms. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus, consisting mainly of type 2. It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the Region. An estimated 22 million people have diabetes, out of a total adult population of 290 million. Studies conducted in different populations of the Region have reported high prevalence rates varying from 7% to 25% in the adult population. In addition, many countries are now reporting the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus at an increasingly young age. People are presenting with type 2 in their twenties and thirties, and in some countries it is emerging in children. This pattern of younger age of onset extends the potential burden of therapy and",

There are a number of factors that might explain the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, not least of all the significant social and economic changes which are being experienced. Rates of obesity are increasing, while people are becoming less physically active; both of these factors increase the risk of developing diabetes. In addition, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases with age, and there is evidence that the current life expectancy in the majority of Eastern Mediterranean countries now exceeds 65 years. The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has set goals and targets for diabetes mellitus prevention at the regional level. Because of the importance of diabetes and its complications in the Region, care should be considered a health priority and should be supported and strengthened by data collection, the establishment of national epidemiological studies, and the formulation of national plans. One promising initiative during the past few years has been the development of national diabetes control programmes in several countries of the Region; in others, committees to develop such In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful",

This publication aims to provide up-to-date, reliable and balanced information for the prevention and care of diabetes mellitus in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The prevalence of diabetes in the Region and the high morbidity that is associated with it stimulated the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean to develop these guidelines in order to address all practical issues relevant to the day-to-day management of glucose and its metabolic disorders, with respect to reduction in related morbidity and mortality. The framework for the guidelines was discussed in the Regional Consultation on Diabetes Prevention and Care, Teheran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2\u20135 February 2003. A consensus on major topics concerning diabetes prevention and care was formulated during the consultation and the conclusions reached are given in Annex 1. Because of the need for a standardized response to the challenge, the following regional strategies have been established for the prevention and care of diabetes: promotion of a healthy lifestyle; raising community awareness (eat less \u2013 walk more); primary prevention of diabetes; screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus; establishment of a regional training course for diabetes educators; and development of national strategy.

They provide the information necessary for decision-making by health care providers and patients themselves about disease management in the most commonly encountered situations. The information is evidence- based and clearly stated to facilitate the use of the guidelines in daily practice. The target population includes physicians at primary, secondary and tertiary level, general practitioners, internists and family medicine specialists, clinical dieticians, nurses and policy-makers at ministries of health.

It is estimated that about one half of persons with diabetes are unaware of their disease and, even in industrialized countries, many individuals go undiagnosed. Although more recent data show that the proportion of undiagnosed cases has decreased, it is still at least about one quarter to one third of all persons with diabetes mellitus. It is predicted that between 2000 and 2025, the size of the world\u2019s adult population will increase from less than 4 billion to 5.5 billion, mainly on account of a 60% increase in developing countries [1]. The number of adults with diabetes in the world is predicted to increase from 150 million in 2000 to 300 million in 2025 [2]. In industrialized countries, the number of diabetics will increase by about one third between 2000 and 2025, while in developing countries that number will more than double [2]. In 2025, more than 75% of the world\u2019s diabetic population will be living in developing countries. Diabetes prevalence in some Eastern Mediterranean countries is among the highest in the world [3\u201316].

These include progressive urbanization, decreasing infant mortality and increased life expectancy. Increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the obesity pandemic and higher life expectancy have led to a dramatic rise in type 2 diabetes in many countries of the Region [4\u201314,16]. Traditional activities and dietary patterns that have sustained people over generations are rapidly disappearing and the socioeconomic situation in many countries has forced people to move to urbanized areas to seek employment, where they are less likely to lead a healthy lifestyle. Thus, it is estimated that in the Eastern Mediterranean Region 22 million people (out of a total adult population of 290 million) have diabetes mellitus, and it is predicted that this figure might increase to 30 million by 2025 [2,3]. In the Region, the diabetes prevalence rate for adults is 14.5%; however, recent studies conducted in different population groups have reported diabetes prevalence rates as high as 20% in the United Arab Emirates [12], 16% in Qatar and 15% in Bahrain. Even in much less affluent Pakistan the prevalence is 11% [4\u201314]. Studies in four countries of the Region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates) showed their current diabetes prevalence rates to be among the ten highest in the world, and a similar situation applies for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) prevalence.

This is particularly true in the areas of screening prevention and early intervention. Diabetes is a costly disease in terms of morbidity, mortality and quality of life. It constitutes a considerable financial burden on individuals, their families, the health sector and governments. In most countries of the Region, specialized diabetes centres are few and far apart and often not within reach of many people with diabetes [2\u201320]. Likewise, trained and experienced diabetologists are few, nutritionists and diabetes nurse educators are uncommon and chiropodists may be non-existent. Besides, the infrastructure at the primary care level is not capable of allowing meticulous implementation of the routine screening procedures, monitoring control and detecting common diabetes complications. In addition, provision of care for diabetes may differ in the same country, varying from very poor or almost non-existent care in some areas to highly structured care in other places [2].

The majority of Eastern Mediterranean countries were found to have national plans for the prevention of diabetes and had already established national guidelines for the prevention and management (Table 3). More than 50% of Eastern Mediterranean countries reported having diabetes control plans. Effective preventive strategies, therefore, already exist but are not being rationally or widely utilized. The management of diabetes needs to be monitored through implementation of national strategies for optimal control of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, specifically, diabetes mellitus is an important public health disorder for many reasons. Not only are the risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus ever increasing, but the individual with diabetes frequently makes his or her decisions concerning the disease outside the clinical setting, either at home, on the job, or within his/her existing community. Many individuals are influenced by traditional beliefs, myths and misconceptions regarding the causes, symptoms and care of diabetes mellitus and continue to seek alternative measures for curing their condition. However, the disease is not only a problem for the individual but is also a societal challenge because of its serious complications and cost of treatment.

    "text": "Chapter 2 Definition and classification Definition In 1999, WHO defined diabetes mellitus as \u201ca metabolic disorder of multiple etiology, characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs\u201d [21]. Thus, the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes result from inadequate insulin action on target tissues, due to deficient insulin secretion or insensitivity to insulin action, or a combination of both [2,22]. Diagnosis The diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic individual should never be made on the basis of a single abnormal glucose value. Verification of the diagnosis with repeat testing is required, unless an individual presents with unequivocal hyperglycaemia along with its classic symptoms. The diagnostic values for diabetes mellitus and other categories of hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 4. Using fasting plasma glucose may not be equivalent to or as accurate as the use of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in identifying individuals with diabetes. Data from the Table 4.

Also, patients diagnosed with diabetes based solely on the fasting glucose level tend to have a different phenotype from those identified based solely on the 2-hour OGTT glucose value [2,21,22]. Classification The classification of diabetes mellitus has evolved considerably over time, taking into account recent advances in the diabetes field. The classification is now primarily based on the etiology (causes) of the disease, rather than its treatment (Figure 2). The revised classification encompasses both clinical stages and etiological types of hyperglycaemia and results from improved understanding of the causes of diabetes mellitus [21]. The clinical staging reflects that diabetes mellitus, regardless of its etiology, progresses through several clinical stages during its natural history. Individuals can move from one stage to another in either direction [21]. The severity of glycaemia may change over time depending on the extent of the underlying disease processes. While there are autoimmune markers that help identify type 1 diabetes mellitus, there are few sensitive or highly specific indicators of the type 2 process at present, although these are likely to be revealed in the future.

In some individuals with type 2 diabetes, adequate glycaemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise and/or oral agents. These individuals, therefore, do not require insulin and may even revert to IGT or normoglycaemia. Other individuals require insulin for adequate glycaemic control but can survive without it. These individuals, by definition, have some residual insulin secretion. Individuals with extensive \u00df-cell destruction, and therefore no residual insulin secretion, require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can even regress (e.g. with weight reduction), progress (e.g. with weight gain), or stay the same [21]. Terminology There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 (requiring insulin for survival) and type 2 (may or may not require insulin for metabolic control). It is recommended that the terms insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and their acronyms IDDM and NIDDM, no longer be used. These terms are confusing and frequently result in patients being classified on the basis of treatment rather than etiology. Figure 2.

Type 1 includes those cases attributable to an autoimmune process, as well as those with \u00df-cell destruction for which neither etiology nor pathogenesis is known (idiopathic). It does not include those forms of \u00df-cell destruction or failure to which specific causes can be assigned (e.g. cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial defect, etc.) [1,2,21,23]. Type 2 includes the common major form of diabetes mellitus which results from defect(s) in insulin secretion, almost always with a major contribution from insulin resistance. It has been argued that a lean phenotype 2 diabetes mellitus in adults found in the Indian sub-continent may be very distinct from the more characteristic form of type 2 found in Caucasians. Not enough information is available, however, to characterize such subjects separately [21]. A recent international meeting reviewed the evidence for, and characteristics of, diabetes mellitus in under-nourished individuals. While it appears that malnutrition may influence the expression of several types of diabetes, the evidence that diabetes can be caused by malnutrition or protein deficiency per se is not convincing. Therefore, it was recommended that the class \u2018malnutrition-related diabetes\u2019 (MRDM) be deleted. The former subtypes of MRDM, protein-deficient pancreatic diabetes (PDPD or PDDM), may be considered as a malnutrition-modulated or -modified form of diabetes mellitus for which more studies are needed.

The class impaired glucose regulation (IGT) is classified as a stage of impaired glucose regulation, since it can be observed in any hyperglycaemic disorder, and is itself not diabetes. A clinical stage of IFG was introduced to classify individuals who have fasting glucose values above the normal range, but below that diagnostic of diabetes. The term gestational diabetes was retained, but now encompasses the groups formerly classified as gestational impaired glucose tolerance (GIGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [21,22]. Impaired glucose regulation IGT and/or impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) refer to a stage that is intermediate between normoglycaemia and diabetes and they represent risk categories for future development of diabetes mellitus [21,23]. The risk of diabetes is increased in persons with IGT. About one third of IGT subjects develop type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the annual incidence rate ranges from 2% to 10% per year [21,22] depending on the population and major risk factors. In addition, the prevalence of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities is significantly higher in persons with IGT compared to persons with normal glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular mortality is higher [23]. Although there are no published estimates of the overall worldwide prevalence of IGT, it is thought to be higher than that of diabetes at around 200 million persons.

The relationship between the prevalence of diabetes and IGT in the population is not simple, but some authors have proposed the use of an epidemicity index [21,22]. This is the ratio between IGT prevalence and diabetes mellitus prevalence, and might indicate the potential for future increase in type 2 prevalence. A high epidemicity index indicates the beginning of an epidemic and is mostly seen in developing countries. Therefore, it is a big issue for developing countries whether to do something about IGT. The values for IFG are a fasting plasma glucose concentration of \u22656.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) (whole blood 5.6 mmol/L, 100 mg/dL), but <7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) (whole blood 6.1 mmol/L, 110 mg/dL). If an OGTT is performed, some individuals with IFG will have IGT. If resources allow, WHO recommends that all those with IFG have an OGTT to exclude the diagnosis of diabetes. Individuals who meet criteria for IGT or IFG may be euglycaemic in their daily lives as shown by normal or near-normal glycated haemoglobin levels. IGT and IFG are not clinical entities in their own right, but rather risk categories for future diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease.

Fasting glucose values above this level are associated with a progressively greater risk of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications. In addition, the pathological or etiological process that often leads to diabetes mellitus begins, and may be recognizable, in some subjects who have normal glucose tolerance. Recognition of these processes at any early stage may be useful if progression to more advanced phases can be prevented.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus Type 1 indicates the processes of \u00df-cell destruction that may ultimately lead to diabetes mellitus in which insulin is required for survival to prevent the development of ketoacidosis, coma and death. An individual with a type 1 process may be metabolically normal before the disease is clinically manifest, but the process of \u00df-cell destruction can be detected. Type 1 is usually characterized by the presence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, islet cell or insulin antibodies which identify the autoimmune processes that lead to \u00df-cell destruction. In some subjects with this clinical form of diabetes, particularly non-Caucasians, no evidence of an autoimmune disorder is demonstrable and these are classified idiopathic type 1. Etiological classification may be possible in some circumstances and not in others. Thus, the category of type 1 diabetes can be identified if appropriate antibody determinations are performed. It is recognized that such measurements may be available only in certain centres at present [23]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes and is characterized by disorders of insulin action and insulin secretion, either of which may be the predominant feature.

A recent study from Taiwan showed type 2 to be the leading cause of diabetes in children aged 6\u201318 years. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region type 2 diabetes should be screened for in children aged over 10 years if the child is overweight (>120% of the ideal body weight) and if two of the following characteristics are present: \u2022 positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (first- or second-degree relative); \u2022 Arab ethnicity; \u2022 signs associated with insulin resistance (polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidaemia).

It does not exclude the possibility that the glucose intolerance may antedate pregnancy but has previously gone unrecognized. The definition applies irrespective of whether or not insulin is used for treatment or whether the condition persists after pregnancy [21,23].

This clustering has been labelled diversely as the metabolic syndrome, syndrome X, or the insulin resistance syndrome [21]. Epidemiological studies confirm that this syndrome occurs commonly in a wide variety of ethnic groups including Caucasians, Afro-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Asian Indians, Chinese, Australian Aborigines, Polynesians and Micronesians. In 1988, Dr Gerald Reaven focused attention on this cluster, naming it Syndrome X. Central obesity was not included in the original description, so the term metabolic syndrome is now favoured. Alone, each component of the cluster conveys increased cardiovascular disease risk, but as a combination they become much more powerful. This means that the management of persons with hyperglycaemia and other features of the metabolic syndrome should focus not only on blood glucose control but also include strategies to reduce the impact of other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The metabolic syndrome with normal glucose tolerance identifies the subject as a member of a group at very high risk of future diabetes. Thus, vigorous early management of the syndrome may have a significant impact on the prevention of both diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially as it is well documented that the features of the metabolic syndrome can be present for up to 10 years before glycaemic",

Hypertension Background Macrovascular disease constitutes the major cause of diabetes mortality, with 80% of patients having and/or dying of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease. Patients with diabetes mellitus exhibit a two to four-fold increase in the risk of coronary events compared to non-diabetic individuals. Although large-scale studies have shown a clear association between improvement in glycaemic control and reduction in microvascular end-organ damage (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy), they have not been able to show a consistent similar relationship between glycaemic control and macrovascular complications. However, many trials have shown a benefit with respect to cardiovascular events, morbidity and mortality when co-existent hypertension is treated. In addition, control of hypertension is also beneficial to microvascular complications. This issue is of paramount importance since close to 60% of patients with diabetes are known to have hypertension. Therefore aggressive strategies aimed at identifying and treating high blood pressure in patients with diabetes should lead to substantial reduction in the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Definition of hypertension Hypertension refers to elevated blood pressure. According to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 2003 [24]: \u2022 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure \u2265140/90 mmHg. \u2022 prehypertension refers to systolic blood pressure 120\u2013139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 80\u201389 mmHg. \u2022 normal blood pressure is <120/80 mmHg. The classification of blood pressure for adults aged \u226518 years is shown in Table 6. Diagnosis should be made based on the mean of two or more blood pressure measurements made while the patient is in the seated position. The possibility of secondary hypertension should be kept in mind and appropriate laboratory investigation undertaken as indicated. Risks associated with hypertension People with diabetes and hypertension have a two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to patients with diabetes alone. In addition, they have an increased risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. Lowering the blood pressure has been shown to have a beneficial effect on these complications. Each 10 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure leads to a decrease in diabetes-related mortality by 15%, diabetes-related complications by 12%, and",

    "text": "Chapter 4 Screening for diabetes mellitus Background The question of mass community screening for diabetes remains controversial. The underlying philosophy of screening has been that detection of diabetes in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals will result in effective treatment that may retard its progression and reduce the risk or the severity of complications, thus diminishing premature morbidity and mortality. This is brought into focus by the frequent presence of specific complications at the time of clinical diagnosis and the estimate that on average subjects had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 4\u20137 years prior to diagnosis [21,23]. Over the years, opinions have changed frequently on the value of mass screening. Initially it was widely recommended, however at present it is recommended only for individuals at risk or for epidemiological studies. This position is supported by many well-designed screening programmes that have provided valuable information about the prevalence of diabetes and IGT and their natural history in different populations. Such data are essential for public health planning and provide information for continued evaluation of the current diagnostic criteria. Screening programmes can also improve community awareness and pave the way for education about diabetes. Important considerations in the design of an appropriate screening programme include [21,23]: \u2022 the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the screening test; \u2022 the cost-effectiveness and resource requirements of the screening methodology and any necessary follow-up in the context of the anticipated positive detection rate; \u2022 the definition of the target population to be screened; \u2022 the",

Therefore appropriate explanations and procedures should be incorporated into the screening protocol and programme design to minimize adverse effects and to address them when they do occur. It must be emphasized that screening is only worthwhile if an effective intervention can be introduced to decrease the burden of the disease or prevent its complications. The current state of knowledge suggests that definitive proof of the value of screening is lacking, but evidence in its favour is steadily accumulating. The approach to screening that is adopted will depend on: \u2022 the resources available; \u2022 the potential disease burden; \u2022 the risk factor distribution [1,2,21,22]. Screening approaches A positive result in a screening test indicates only a high probability of the individual having the disease. The diagnosis of diabetes cannot be made on the basis of a single abnormal blood glucose value in an asymptomatic individual [21]. Confirmatory tests are always necessary for a definitive diagnosis to be made. There are three different approaches to screening: population, selective and opportunistic. Population screening [21] Population screening is worthwhile only for health care planning, for epidemiological research purposes or in high-prevalence populations. It can be used to identify individuals with IGT provided the OGTT is employed. In most societies, it is ineffective in terms of cost and effort to screen low-risk individuals for type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as children and young adults. Selective",

Alternatives, such as measurements of glycated haemoglobin, glycated proteins and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, although specific, are too insensitive to reliably detect lesser degrees of glycaemic disturbances. There are many methods available for measuring blood glucose, ranging from visually-read test-strips to sophisticated automated methods. Precision and accuracy are required for screening. If portable meters are to be used, they should be checked under a full quality assurance programme and a coefficient of variation >5% should not be accepted. When automated procedures are used, care must be taken to minimize the risk of errors in sample identification. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) The oral glucose tolerance test remains the definitive confirmatory diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus. Glucose levels \u226511.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose load are diagnostic of diabetes. Fasting plasma glucose Fasting is defined as avoiding the consumption of any food or beverage other than water for at least 10\u201316 hours before testing. Fasting blood and plasma glucose levels are interpreted in Table 11. Casual blood glucose measurement Levels >7.8 mmol/L should be an indication for further testing. A value equal to 10.0 mmol/L in venous whole blood or 11.1 mmol/L in venous plasma is suggestive of diabetes. Sensitivity and specificity can vary, depending on the cut-off used [23]. Table 11.

Screening strategies Screening programmes should not be embarked upon without full recognition of the cost implications, both for screening and for follow-up and clinical care of individuals in whom diabetes is detected. Proper training is required for those conducting the screening, and the importance and relevance of the diagnostic programme to health care should be made explicit. Every screening programme must have an established mechanism for follow-up and further evaluation of those with a positive result. To be more specific, a screening programme should identify individuals with one or more diabetes risk factors. This can be done by means of a written or verbal questionnaire. Individuals with more than one risk factor should be referred for evaluation and testing. Screening for type 1 diabetes mellitus [23] Given current knowledge, screening can be recommended only for research purposes related to the prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Evaluation [23] Screening for diabetes is justified on the grounds that early detection allows effective early intervention, thus diminishing the likelihood of the development of complications. Selective high-risk and opportunistic screening must be accompanied by confirmatory diagnosis and appropriate follow-up of new cases.

Glycaemic goals are based on evidence of what glucose levels constitute a risk for developing complications. It is, however, inappropriate to aggressively approach target glucose levels when it may adversely affect the patient. Treatment goals must, therefore, be individualized. The goal of treatment of diabetes mellitus is to control blood glucose and ultimately prevent long-term complications, as shown by major diabetes studies like the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study group and Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [27\u201329]. Insulin therapy is necessary to control hyperglycaemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Provided hyperglycaemia is mild in type 2 diabetes, patients may be given at least a one month trial of diet, exercise and weight management in order to control hyperglycaemia. If this regimen does not lead to adequate blood glucose control, the physician will need to prescribe oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents and/or insulin [29]. Objectives of therapy The main objectives of therapy for diabetes mellitus are: \u2022 to eliminate symptoms of hyperglycaemia; \u2022 to achieve optimum control; \u2022 to reduce or eliminate microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus; \u2022 to treat associated disorders; \u2022 to allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible.

It is now well established that multiple metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk, such as dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension, are already present at diagnosis. Consequently, treatment of hyperglycaemia alone cannot be expected to normalize the two to four-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality of these patients. In align with this, results of many intervention studies have demonstrated marked benefit from antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet therapy. Earlier recognition of at-risk individuals with screening and the subsequent investigation of a wide spectrum of preventive and corrective measures is recommended.

    "text": "Chapter 6 Treatment options Background The backbone of diabetes management is proper diet and regular exercise, which have to be individualized [30,31]. Both could be the only management needed for controlling blood glucose in gestational diabetes, IGT and in type 2 diabetes in its early phase. Patients with type 2 diabetes may require oral hypoglycaemic agents and/or insulin, while type 1 patients need insulin therapy to survive. The treatment plan for diabetes may include [23,25,31]: \u2022 diabetes education \u2022 meal planning and nutritional recommendations \u2022 exercise \u2022 anti-diabetic agents \u2022 insulin \u2022 management of associated conditions and complications. The care of an individual with diabetes mellitus requires a multidisciplinary team. Central to success of this team are the patient\u2019s participation, input, and enthusiasm. Members of the health team include primary care provider and/or diabetologist, nutritionist, and a diabetes educator. When the complications of diabetes mellitus arise, sub-specialists including neurologists, podiatrists, nephrologists, vascular surgeon, cardiologists and ophthalmologists are essential. Comprehensive diabetes care, therefore, means that optimal diabetes therapy involves more than plasma glucose management. It should also detect and manage diabetes mellitus complications and modify diabetes mellitus-related risk factors [30]. Nutritional recommendations [23,31] The goals of medical nutrition therapy that apply to all persons with diabetes mellitus are as follows. \u2022 To attain and maintain optimal metabolic outcomes, including: \u2212 blood glucose levels in the normal range; \u2212 a lipid and lipoprotein profile that reduces the risk for macrovascular disease; \u2212 blood pressure levels that reduce the risk for vascular disease.",

Diet composition for subjects with diabetes Carbohydrates [23,30] With regard to carbohydrates, there is strong evidence that the total amount of carbohydrate in meals or snacks is more important than the source or type. Hence sucrose and sucrose-containing foods do not need to be restricted by people with diabetes mellitus. It is important to note, however, that sucrose must be substituted for other carbohydrates gram for gram and not simply added to the meal plan. Non-nutritive sweeteners are safe for people with diabetes when consumed within the acceptable daily intake levels established by the FDA. There is strong evidence that large amounts of dietary fibre (50 g/day) may have beneficial effects on glycaemia, insulinaemia, and lipaemia. Proteins During moderate hyperglycaemia, obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased turnover of proteins compared to non-diabetic obese subjects. Based on this evidence, the protein requirements for diabetics may be greater than the recommended daily amount, but not greater than the usual intakes of 10%\u201320% of the total daily energy requirement. Limited evidence suggests that it may be prudent to avoid protein intake >20% of total",

Therefore, if saturated fat calories need to be replaced, they can be replaced with carbohydrate or mono-unsaturated fat, either of which can contribute to a reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol. There is strong evidence for the following statements. \u2022 When compared with saturated fatty acids, poly-unsaturated fatty acids decrease plasma total and LDL cholesterol. \u2022 When compared to poly-unsaturated fatty acid, mono-unsaturated fatty acids decrease plasma total and LDL cholesterol. \u2022 Trans-fatty acids raise plasma LDL cholesterol and lower plasma HDL cholesterol; therefore their intake should be minimized. General dietary recommendations for subjects with diabetes For subjects with diabetes and a dyslipidaemic profile, the following distribution of nutrients is recommended [23,25] (Box 2). If the diabetic subject has a normal lipid profile, then the carbohydrate intake can be increased to 55% of daily intake and the fat intake decreased to 25%\u201330%. Many individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus are overweight (body mass index \u2265 25 kg/m2), and approximately 36% are obese (body mass index \u226530 kg/m2). As body adiposity increases, so does insulin resistance. Obesity may also aggravate dyslipidaemia and hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the effects of obesity on insulin resistance, weight loss is an important therapeutic objective for obese individuals with type 2 diabetes [23,25]. Box 2.

Ongoing nutrition self-management education and care need to be available for individuals with diabetes. In light of the existence of complexities of nutrition issues in diabetes, a qualified dietician knowledgeable and skilled in such issues is needed. Exercise [30\u201335] Exercise is extremely important in the management of diabetes because of its effect on blood glucose and free fatty acids. Exercise burns calories and helps to control weight, eases stress and tension, and maintains a feeling of well-being. In addition, regular exercise improves the body\u2019s response to insulin and may make oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin more effective. It also promotes circulation, and lowers cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Persons with diabetes should be encouraged to lead a normal life and participate in sports and exercise programmes. Generally they should not be excluded from physical activities or games, unless there are complications and on the advice of a physician. The main risk when exercising is hypoglycaemia, therefore blood glucose should be checked before exertion, and if appropriate, medication dosage may need to be reduced before exercise, or the individual may need to take an extra carbohydrate snack. Before starting any exercise programme, the health provider should do a thorough physical examination to find out whether or not it is safe for the patient to exercise. Pharmacological",

Any decision by the patient to fast should be done after ample consultation and discussion with his/her physician. An individually-based insulin regimen using a basal-bolus method (such as glargine for basal insulin and pre-meal lispro) is a consideration for patients who insist on fasting. Close follow-up and frequent monitoring are essential. It is not recommended for poorly-controlled type 2 patients to fast, because of the risk of dehydration associated with hyperglycaemia. Patients controlled by diet alone can fast. Patients treated with oral agents may fast if allowed by their physician, however their regimen will need to be adjusted. Metformin and thiazolidinediones are the preferred drugs, because they are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared to insulin secretagogues. Short-acting insulin secretagogues are preferable to sulfonylureas. Insulin-treated patients may be treated like type 1 patients, using a basal-bolus method, or other regimens as recommended by the patient\u2019s physician. Close follow-up and frequent monitoring are essential. Attention should be paid to the fast-breaking meal, particularly excessive intake of sweets and sweetened drinks, since this can lead to uncontrolled postprandial hyperglycaemia.

Considerable evidence demonstrates the beneficial changes in diabetic dyslipidaemia following dietary alterations such as changes in nutrient composition. Exercise is as an important method of improving diabetes control and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease; additional evidence suggests that it has beneficial effects on dyslipidaemia, such as significantly increasing HDL cholesterol levels.

Background The development of hypoglycaemia is an ever-present possibility in all patients with diabetes treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic medications. A person with hypoglycaemia may feel nervous, shaky, weak, or sweaty. They may have a headache, blurred vision, and be very hungry. In more serious instances, they may become unconscious [21]. Taking small amounts of sugar or glucose-containing juice or food will usually help the person feel better within 10\u201315 minutes. The serious consequences of hypoglycaemia relate to its effects on the brain, including loss of cognitive function, seizure and coma. Prolonged or repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia may produce permanent brain damage, and the adrenergic response to the condition may be dangerous in people with cardiovascular disease. The risk of hypoglycaemia is particularly high when tight glycaemic control is sought. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [29] there was a three-fold increase in the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, including coma and/or seizures, when intensive insulin therapy was used. These episodes may occur with disproportionate frequency at night. Patients with autonomic neuropathy may have greater difficulty in detecting symptoms of hypoglycaemia and/or recovering from it. \u00df-adrenoreceptor blockers may also impair detection of symptoms and/or recovery, and alcohol consumption may aggravate the risk of hypoglycaemia and impair recovery.

Hypoglycaemia as a result of physical activity For sporadic physical activity departing from the patient\u2019s usual daily routine, action needs to be taken to avert hypoglycaemia. Such action might include consumption of extra carbohydrate food to cover the increased activity. Initially, this may be 10\u201315 g of carbohydrate every 30\u201345 minutes during increased activity. Blood glucose should be monitored before, during and after exercise to determine the effectiveness of this intervention. Another option is to reduce the dose of insulin either in addition to, or instead of, giving dietary carbohydrate supplements. All patients should have quick-acting, rapidly-absorbed carbohydrate available when exercising in case of hypoglycaemia. Patients should realize that moderately intensive exercise may deplete glycogen stores, resulting in a sustained food requirement to replace the glycogen. As a consequence, hypoglycaemia may occur well after exercise (e.g. 12 hours after jogging). For this reason, patients should be cautious",

Omission or insufficient insulin intake is a major cause of diabetic ketoacidosis in some parts of the world. With proper instruction on monitoring of blood glucose and urine ketones, insulin dose adjustment and maintenance of fluid intake, many potential cases of diabetic ketoacidosis can be prevented. If vomiting occurs, early referral for intravenous therapy is required. It is rare for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus to develop ketoacidosis.

It accounts for 75% of diabetes-related deaths, a figure two to three times higher than that in people without diabetes. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, some studies have reported that the occurrence of clinical events related to coronary artery disease are four times higher in patients with diabetes [13,40]. Coronary and cerebrovascular diseases are also two to three times more common, and post-infarction mortality higher. These increases in atherosclerosis in diabetic individuals are seen in all populations, whether the general incidence of atherosclerosis is high or low. In developing and rural societies, changes in lifestyle to a pattern similar to that of more industrialized and urban societies are often associated with a general increase in atherosclerosis. Although the largest numbers of diabetic ischaemic events occur in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk of atherosclerosis is also high in type 1 and may be manifest at a young age. One feature unique to women with diabetes is the loss of protection from atherosclerosis prior to menopause. Hyperglycaemia may promote atherosclerosis by: \u2022 modifications of lipoproteins (e.g. glycation of LDL) \u2022 glycation of arterial wall proteins \u2022 formation of advanced glycation end-products \u2022 stimulation of insulin secretion \u2022 stimulation of protein kinase C.

There is also a great increase in the risk of macrovascular disease in people with urinary albumin excretion exceeding 30 mg/24 hours and in those with clinical nephropathy. People with these characteristics are therefore important targets for prevention. People with diabetes should therefore be screened for risk factors for macrovascular disease (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular). There is ample evidence that aspirin intake confers both primary and secondary prevention against cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Its use is highly recommended. Retinopathy Background Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in adults in many societies. Almost everyone with younger-onset type 1 diabetes will develop diabetic retinopathy after 20 years of the disease.

Diabetic patients are 17 times as prone to kidney disease as non-diabetic people. It is a multistage condition that requires several years to become clinically overt. The stages are as follows: \u2022 incipient (sub-clinical) nephropathy \u2022 clinical (or overt) nephropathy \u2022 advanced nephropathy \u2022 end-stage renal disease. Incipient nephropathy is defined by a persistent increase in albumin excretion rate, referred to as microalbuminuria without frank proteinuria. It is represented by an albumin excretion rate of 20\u2013200 \u00b5g/minute (30\u2013300 mg/24 hours). Microalbuminuria may be accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. Clinical nephropathy is defined by the presence of persistent proteinuria, i.e. albumin secretion >200 \u00b5g/minute (>300 mg/24 hours), and is usually accompanied by hypertension. In advanced nephropathy there is a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate and the appearance of symptoms of uraemia and/or nephrotic syndrome. End-stage renal disease necessitates dialysis or renal transplantation. While the cumulative risk of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus is about 30%\u201340% after 25\u201330 years, it varies considerably in type 2 diabetes mellitus depending on ethnic origin, and can be as low as 15% in some groups of European origin after 25 years of disease.

Conclusions Tighter blood pressure and glycaemic control is needed in patients at risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. Vigorous treatment of clinical nephropathy may delay the development of end-stage renal disease. One of the highest priorities at the present time is the education of patients and their physicians about the potential for early detection and prevention of diabetic kidney disease. The likelihood of success in preventing and reducing the consequences of diabetic kidney disease will depend on the availability of resources to implement educational programmes and to monitor them continuously [22,23]. Diabetic neuropathy Background Diabetic neuropathy is a nerve disorder that may be clinically evident or sub- clinical, and which occurs in diabetes mellitus in the absence of other evident etiology. Manifestations may occur in both the peripheral and the autonomic nervous systems [44]. Peripheral neuropathies include: \u2022 polyneuropathies, e.g. distal sensory-motor neuropathy and proximal motor neuropathy; \u2022 focal neuropathies, e.g. mono-neuropathies (including cranial) and entrapment neuropathies; \u2022 multifocal neuropathies. Autonomic neuropathies may involve the following systems: \u2022 cardiovascular \u2022 gastrointestinal \u2022 genitourinary [22]. The most common form of neuropathy is distal symmetrical sensory\u2013motor polyneuropathy, which can be divided into three stages: early, symptomatic and severe. Early distal sensory\u2013motor neuropathy is usually asymptomatic, but sensory abnormalities may be detectable by neuro-physiological testing. Symptomatic distal sensory-motor neuropathy is manifested by sensory",

Hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes is thought to be central to the effect on nerve structure through a number of possible mechanisms, including increased activity in the polyol pathway, altered myo-inositol metabolism and non-enzymatic glycation. Other mechanisms may also be involved, e.g. alterations in nerve growth factor activity, blood viscosity, circulating platelets and the rate of synthesis and transport of intra-axonal protein. There may also be interactions between these pathways. The presence of neuropathy is associated with significant morbidity, including: \u2022 recurrent foot infections and ulceration, possibly leading to amputation; \u2022 impotence in diabetic men; \u2022 sudden death in individuals with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Screening strategies Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy may be detected by testing heart rate control in response to deep breathing (paced respiration) or after standing from the lying position, and/or the circulatory response to the Valsalva manoeuvre. This may be important as a screen before a patient undergoes general anaesthesia, since those with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy have an increased mortality risk from such a procedure. A simple screening procedure for distal sensory-motor neuropathy includes: \u2022 inspection of the feet for evidence of dry skin, hair or nail abnormalities, callus or infection; \u2022 the grading of vibratory sensation at the dorsum of the toe as normal, reduced or absent; \u2022 the grading of ankle reflexes as normal, reduced or absent.

The frequency, severity and progression of neuropathy are related to the degree and duration of hyperglycaemia, and may also be a function of age. Several randomized studies have suggested that manifestations of neuropathy may be stabilized or improved by improved glucose control [27]. Aldose reductase inhibitors are now available in an increasing number of countries. They offer the potential for inhibiting the polyol pathway, one of the pathways thought to lead to diabetic neuropathy. Other interventions aimed at altering the pathophysiology of neuropathy are under evaluation. Symptomatic and supportive treatments are also necessary to reduce the burden imposed by diabetic neuropathy. There should be early identification of those patients at risk of developing neuropathic foot problems and appropriate education should be given [22,23]. Foot ulceration and amputation in diabetic patients will be looked at in detail in the following section. Potential obstacles to prevention include: \u2022 lack of awareness of the limb-threatening and disabling nature of diabetic neuropathy because the disorder is asymptomatic in its early stages; \u2022 lack of awareness among primary care physicians of the benefits of timely detection and treatment; \u2022 primary care physicians\u2019 lack of necessary skills in detecting neuropathy; \u2022 lack of economic resources to seek care; \u2022 lack of neurologists to evaluate neuropathy quantitatively, e.g. by neuro-physiological testing; \u2022",

Neuropathic foot Background More hospital beds are occupied by diabetic patients with foot problems than by those with all other consequences of diabetes. The problem of limb amputation in people with diabetes is of such a serious and global nature that a special section giving guidelines for prevention was felt to be warranted in this publication [22,23].

A number of preventive strategies (careful self-examination, specially fitted shoes, minimization of trauma, etc.) alongside earlier detection and more aggressive management of foot ulcers (e.g. local debridement, provision of special supports and early antibiotic therapy) will prevent or delay lower-limb amputations. In developing countries, lack of proper footwear and inadequate hygiene, together with poorly controlled diabetes, are major causes of lower- limb amputations. Studies have shown the financial benefit of prevention of amputation. Hospitalization for treatment of infection and/or amputation may often last several weeks. Ambulatory care and education may therefore save substantial amounts of money. Screening strategies The key to success in managing the diabetic foot is to organize a regular screening programme to identify all patients at risk of developing foot ulcers. Physicians should examine the feet of diabetic patients on a regular basis. In some situations it may be helpful to create a registry (adapted, if possible, to the local health care system) of all people with diabetes so that they may be called for regular screening and identified if they are at risk. Patients at risk should be seen regularly and should expect their physicians to perform regular foot examinations [22].

Simple tools, such as the graduated tuning fork and standard monofilament, are useful for the semi-quantitative diagnostic evaluation of neuropathy. Wherever possible, diabetic patients who have significant vascular disease and ischaemia of the foot should have access to the modern investigative techniques of Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography. Non-invasive angioplasty or surgical arterial reconstruction should be performed if indicated. If angiography is to be performed, special attention should be paid to patients with nephropathy, even in its early stages, since radiopaque dye administration can provoke renal deterioration. Appropriate hydration before the procedure is often necessary [21,22]. In the treatment of established foot ulcers, early local debridement and aggressive antibiotic therapy should be considered. For resistant foot ulcers, special plantar supports or castings should be provided. Patients need to understand the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Every member of the diabetes care team should understand and practice the principles of foot protection. A specialist foot-care team should be part of every comprehensive diabetes care service. The foot-care team should consist of a physician, a nurse specialist or educator, and a chiropodist or podiatrist.

If no specialists are available, experienced general practitioners and home visiting nurses can manage at least two-thirds of cases, providing they have received 1 or 2 days formal training. Currently, many of the above health professionals and services are still unavailable in developing countries, where they are most needed. In this event, training of non- specialist health workers and simple direct instructions to patients themselves are likely to reduce the risk of serious tissue destruction. As with other diabetic complications, the frequency of follow-up of foot complications will depend on their type and severity.

While there is not yet conclusive evidence to suggest that type 1 diabetes mellitus can be prevented, primary prevention of type 2 is possible. Primary prevention has an impact by reducing both the need for diabetes care and the need to treat diabetic complications [32,45]. Secondary and tertiary preventions are key to reducing the risk of costly diabetic complications, as well as their associated disabilities. There is great potential for tertiary prevention in diabetes, especially with regard to blindness, limb amputation and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Rehabilitation and special assistance are required for those who do develop disabling complications. Overall, action taken early in the course of diabetes is more beneficial in terms of quality of life as well as being more cost-effective, especially if this action can prevent hospital admission. Many barriers exist at the prevention level, including: \u2022 lack of knowledge and awareness by individuals and communities; \u2022 inadequately trained personnel in the preventive health care field; \u2022 inadequate use of media for creating awareness for health education; \u2022 changing of deeply-rooted lifestyles is very difficult; \u2022 social problems [45].

Secondary prevention is the key to reducing the risk of costly and disabling diabetic complications. There is now conclusive evidence that good control of blood glucose levels can substantially reduce these complications. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study group [27,28] have proven that the risk of diabetic complications can be reduced significantly in people with type 2 diabetes. It showed that: \u2022 with good glucose control, diabetes-related complications (such as blindness, stroke, renal disease, limb amputation and heart attack) can be reduced by 12%. \u2022 with good blood pressure control, diabetes-related complications can be reduced by 24%, and diabetes-related deaths by up to 32%.

They recommended that diabetes be established as a health priority in the current and future national programmes/plans, and that Member States establish secondary prevention activities, such as screening, in order to identify asymptomatic individuals who have diabetes and are at risk of developing complications. They also recommended that diabetes education be promoted in its various forms and methods within the framework of a national diabetes control programme, targeting the individual family and community, and that community-based healthy lifestyles programmes be developed which focus on maintenance of normal weight, an active lifestyle which includes regular physical activity and cessation of smoking. The participants recommended an integrated approach to prevention and care of diabetes mellitus. Countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region are urged to implement the following strategies. 1. Promotion of healthy lifestyle Political commitment is necessary to advocate and promote a healthy lifestyle for the community that will reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus or diabetes complications. 2.

REVIEW Hypertension in Diabetes: An Update of Basic Mechanisms and Clinical Disease Guanghong Jia , James R. Sowers ABSTRACT: Epidemiological studies have documented that insulin resistance and diabetes not only constitute metabolic abnormalities but also predispose to hypertension, vascular stiffness, and associated cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, excessive arterial stiffness and impaired vasorelaxation, in turn, contribute to worsening insulin resistance and the development of diabetes. Molecular mechanisms promoting hypertension in diabetes include inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, mitochondria dysfunction, excessive oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. This review highlights recent studies which have uncovered new underlying mechanisms for the increased propensity for the development of hypertension in association with diabetes. These include enhanced activation of epithelial sodium channels, alterations in extracellular vesicles and their microRNAs, abnormal gut microbiota, and increased renal sodium-glucose cotransporter activity, which collectively predispose to hypertension in association with diabetes. This review also covers socioeconomic factors and currently recommended blood pressure targets and related treatment strategies in diabetic patients with hypertension.

Therefore, there is a chicken- egg relationship between hypertension and diabetes (Figure 1).2 To this point, hypertension occurs in 50% to 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes, who make up over 90% of the diabetic population versus \u224830% of patients with type 1 diabetes who develop hypertension.3,4 That hypertension is especially common in type 2 diabetes suggests that insulin resistance may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this hypertension. Addition- ally, a prospective cohort study of 12 550 adults 45 to 64 years old found that type 2 diabetes was almost 2.5 times as likely to develop in patients with hypertension as in those with normal blood pressure.3\u20135 Data from the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults), and the Framingham Heart Study off- spring cohort in 10 893 participants showed that hyper- tension is a risk factor for diabetes and often precedes the development of diabetes.4 Our understanding of mechanisms by which insulin resistance contributes to the development of hypertension in type 2 diabetes is evolving.

About 80% of type 1 diabetic individuals present with microal- buminuria and have diabetic nephropathy that typically plays a major role in the development of their hyperten- sion.5 Resistant hypertension is more common in these patients than nondiabetic hypertensive individuals,6,7 and this resistance is associated with a higher risk of diabetic nephropathy progression.5 Patients with the much more common type 2 diabetes often present with coexisting hypertension and diabetes in the absence of clinical renal disease. Epidemiologi- cal studies indicate that there is a very high incidence of hypertension, including increases in resistant hyperten- sion and associated CVD in patients with type 2 diabe- tes.1 In the Framingham Heart Study, type 2 diabetes was associated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of hyperten- sion, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarc- tion.8 A recent analysis of the Framingham data further showed that the population with hypertension at the time of diabetes diagnosis had higher rates of mortality for all causes and CVD events compared with normotensive persons with diabetes.9 These data support a strong rela- tionship between coexistent type 2 diabetes and hyper- tension and associated increases in CVD.

This analysis showed that the association between insulin sensitivity/resistance and hypertension was attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for increases in body mass index.12 These findings suggest that obesity and insulin resistance are inextricably linked in promotion of hypertension including that in type 2 diabetes.

These findings suggest that increased insulin resis- tance may play an important role in the high prevalence of hypertension as well diabetes in Black populations. Socioeconomic and environmental factors likely have a substantial impact on the development of hyper- tension in persons with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.16\u201318 For example, foods that are traditionally considered healthy and promoted as components of the dietary approach to stop hypertension diet18 are often unavailable to people living in disadvantaged commu- nities of color due to either lack of access or reasons of affordability.19 Instead, they become consumers of cheap high salt and high caloric foods, leading to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.18,19 Furthermore, lack of safe outdoor spaces discourages exercise, and exposure to environmental air and water pollution also predispose to insulin resistance, diabetes, and hyper- tension.19 These social and environmental disparities likely help explain the poorer outcomes with coronavi- rus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections that are seen in minorities as well as those with both diabetes and hypertension.19 OBESITY CONTRIBUTES TO INSULIN RESISTANCE",

The high incidence of overweight/obesity is closely related to overconsump- tion of inexpensive and palatable high fat and high refined carbohydrate diets.21 Indeed, a positive association even exists between a progressive increase in body mass index within the normal and overweight range and the risk of hypertension and CVD.22 Related to this, data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that excess body weight accounted for appropriate 26% of cases of hyper- tension in men and 28% in women.23 In addition, obese children were at \u22483-fold higher risk for hypertension than nonobese children.24 Increased visceral adipose tissue and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue are especially associated with obesity-related metabolic and vascular complications.25 For instance, in a study of 382 diabetic individuals, higher visceral adipose tissue, independent of body mass index, was associated with a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia and increased the risk for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and CVD.26 Mechanistically, proinflamma- tory adipokines, including leptin and aldosterone, released from visceral fat may promote systemic and vascular insu- lin resistance and inflammation, impaired relaxation and vascular stiffness and development of hypertension.27 Figure 1.

An increase in the augmentation index, a measure of arterial stiffness, was independently associ- ated with all-cause mortality and a composite end point of CVD and diabetes-related death in a prospective cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that arterial stiff- ness predicts both all-cause mortality and the composite end point of CVD and diabetes-related death in patients with type 1 diabetes.28 Recent data also suggest that the hyperinsulinemia accompanying insulin resistance is an independent risk factor for arterial stiffening.21 Another study investigated the relationships between arterial stiff- ness indexes and serum insulin and glucose tolerance measurements in a biracial population of 4701 men and women aged 45 to 64. Patients with borderline abnormal glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes had stiffer arteries than their counterparts with normal glucose tolerance.29 It was suggested that interactive effects of elevated glucose and insulin may have a synergistic impact on arterial stiff- ness and play an important role in the early pathophysiology of hypertension and CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes.30 MECHANISMS IN INSULIN RESISTANCE/ DIABETES-INDUCED HYPERTENSION While diabetic nephropathy is the major driving factor for hypertension in type 1 diabetes, inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic",

Inappropriate Activation of RAAS and SNS Activation of the systemic and tissue RAAS in states of insulin resistance, obesity, and associated hyperglycemia plays an important role in the development of hyperten- sion. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that insulin resistance and hyperglycemia induce systemic RAAS activation in association with increased vascular resis- tance and arterial pressure.31 Inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT-1R (angio- tensin type 1 receptor) blockers, and MR (mineralocor- ticoid receptor) antagonists reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients with diabetes.32,33 Inappropriate activation of the RAAS observed in insulin resistance and diabetes is likely to impair insulin signaling which con- tributes to development of hypertension (Figure 2). To this point, angiotensin II and aldosterone increase serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins, leading to decreased activity of insulin downstream sig- naling pathways in PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase) and Akt (protein kinase B), which leads to reduced eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) activation by insulin and reduced nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilation.1 The hyperinsulinemia associated with metabolic insu- lin resistance stimulates production of the vasoconstric- tor ET-1 (endothelin-1) via a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway (Figure 2).

Inappropriate activation of the SNS is often a feature of hypertension associated with obesity and insulin resistance. In this regard, overactivity of the SNS induced, in part, by insu- lin resistance and hyperinsulinemia has been documented in both animal models34,35 and hypertensive individuals.36,37 Moreover, the presence of hypertension appears to further elevate the SNS responses to insulin.37 Increased sympa- thetic tone induces stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors which promotes insulin resistance through the activation of serine/threonine kinases which blunts insulin metabolic signaling.38 Elevated blood pressure in response to hyper- insulinemia may also be mediated by changes in baroreflex sensitivity39 and by central nervous system hypertension promoting effects of hyperinsulinemia.34 Role of Mitochondria Dysfunction and Excessive Oxidative Stress The metabolic actions of insulin are dependent on normal mitochondria function, which plays a key role in energy homeostasis by metabolizing nutrients and producing ATP and cellular energy generation. Insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunc- tion, characterized by reduced energy production.40 For instance, defects in mitochondria biogenesis and dynam- ics in endothelial cells have detrimental consequences on their bioenergetic supply and",

In diabetes excessive ROS production can induce damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to mitochon- drial dysfunction. NADPH oxidases are also an important source of excess ROS production in the vasculature in insulin resistance and hypertension.41 Insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with increased activation of vascular NADPH oxidases thereby inducing excessive ROS production which causes an imbalance between endothelium-derived relaxing factors and endothelium- derived contractile factors leading to associated increases in vascular tone. Excessive ROS reduce NO production and increase destruction of NO leading to diminished bio- available NO, which contributes to arterial stiffness and hypertension. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are likely important instigators of hyper- tension in states of insulin resistance and diabetes. Inflammation Systemic and cardiovascular inflammation are important contributors to the development of insulin resistance, dia- betes, and hypertension. For instance, enhanced TLR (Toll- like receptor)-mediated proinflammatory signaling induces activation of nuclear factor kappa B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase that promote release of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, vas- cular cell adhesion molecular 1, and monocyte chemoat- tractant protein-1.1 These proinflammatory cytokines can impair insulin metabolic signaling and reduce insulin- mediated NO production, leading to arterial stiffness and hypertension.

Perivascular adipose tissue, a special local deposit of adi- pose tissue surrounding blood vessels, provides mechani- cal protection and modulates blood vessel tone.42 In the setting of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, increased NADPH oxidase-derived ROS and proinflamma- tory adipokines from perivascular adipose tissue contrib- ute to vascular insulin resistance and impaired relaxation.42 Data from the Framingham Offspring and Third Genera- tion cohorts support the notion that altered perivascular adipose tissue volume is linked with higher thoracic and abdominal aortic dimensions and increased stiffness even after adjusting for sex, age, and CVD risk factors, including body mass index and visceral adipose tissue volume.43 Abnormal Release of EVs and Their miRs Contribute to Insulin Resistance, Diabetes, and Hypertension There is emerging evidence that diabetes and hyper- tension are associated with abnormal release of EVs, which normally mediate cell-to-cell communications.44 For instance, the patients with hypertension often have increased circulating endothelial and platelet EVs,45,46 as well as urinary endothelial microparticles.47 Moreover, the intraperitoneal of plasma exosomes from spontaneously hypertensive rats induced an increases of systolic blood pressure in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats,48 suggesting that abnormal circulating and urinary EVs may be bio- markers associated with the pathogenesis and progres- sion of hypertension. Importantly, EVs contain various molecular constituents, including proteins, mRNA, and Figure 2. Proposed molecular",

Recent data suggest that exo- somal miRs are involved in activation of the RAAS, oxi- dative stress, and inflammation, and these abnormalities may induce vascular dysfunction and hypertension.49,50 Indeed, increased levels of miR-223, miR-320, miR-501, miR504, and miR1 and decreased levels of miR-16, miR-133, miR-492, and miR-373 have been related to insulin resistance and diabetes-related hypertension.51 These data suggest that exosomal miRs are important biomarkers in patients with insulin resistance, diabetes, and hypertension. Gut Microbiota Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota changes contribute to insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and CVD. In this regard, the gut flora has about 100 trillion micro-organism species, and these bacteria modulate normal metabolic activities and physiological functions. For instance, the cecal bacte- ria from the phylum Bacteroidetes that are regarded as good bacteria are reduced in obesity, and this reduc- tion is accompanied by a proportional increase in bad bacteria with the phylum Firmicutes.52 These deleteri- ous changes in gut bacteria have also been observed in insulin resistant ob/ob53 and db/db54 type 2 diabetic mice. A recent study provides evidence that gut microbi- ota may have a causal role in insulin resistance and type 2",

Moreover, cohousing mice harboring an obese twin\u2019s microbiota with mice containing the lean co-twin\u2019s microbiota prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated meta- bolic phenotypes in obese cage mates.55 Furthermore, oral administration of good bacteria improves the gut barrier dysfunction and metabolic disorders in obese and type 2 diabetic mice,56 suggesting that transmis- sibility of intestinal microbes and the metabolic pheno- type are closely linked and that it is possible to impact obesity, insulin resistance, and associated hypertension by modulating the composition of the microbiota. To this point, one study showed that gut microbiota can produce norepinephrine, thereby promoting vascular constriction and hypertension in the insulin resistant state.57 Moreover, Enterococcus faecalis directly contrib- utes to hypertension and renal injury by interfering lipid metabolism.58 Thus, alterations of gut microbiota pro- vide a new mechanism in exploring insulin resistance and diabetes-induced hypertension. Contribution of SGLT2 to Insulin Resistance, Diabetes, and Hypertension Glucose homeostasis is impaired in individuals with insulin resistant associated diabetes, in part, as a consequence of an increased capacity to absorb renal glucose and via proximal tubule SGLT2, which is responsible for proximal tubule reabsorption of about 90% of filtered glucose.59 The glucose reabsorption in the kidney normally has a maximal threshold corresponding to glucose plasma lev- els. However, individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have a higher threshold due",

Many patients with diabetes with hyperten- sion manifest a resistant form of hypertension requiring the addition of MR antagonists to their combination ther- apy.62,63 This includes nonsteroidal MR antagonists (ie, Fineronone) which has recently been shown to reduce CVD events as well as reducing advancement of renal disease in patients with diabetes and kidney disease.64,65 In recent years, newer antihyperglycemic medica- tions, such as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, have been found to lower blood pressure as well improving glucose metabolism. For instance, exenatide, an analog of GLP-1, was evaluated in the EXSCEL trial (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascu- lar Event Lowering)",

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study (Empagliflozin Car- diovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) showed that empagliflozin reduced blood pressure and major adverse CVD events, death, and hospitalization for heart failure.68 In the DECLARE- TIMI 58 trial (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58) in patients with type 2 diabetes and CVD, dapagliflozin treatment reduced blood pressure but failed to reduce major adverse CVD events.69 Recent evidence from the CREDENCE trial (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) further found that canagliflozin reduced blood pressure and slowed diabetic nephropathy pro- gression.60 Therefore, both incretin-based and SGLT2 inhibitor therapy are beneficial in patients with diabetes with hypertension. SUMMARY AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Insulin resistance and diabetes increase the preva- lence of hypertension. The underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms include inappropriate activation of the RAAS and SNS, enhanced renal and endothelial sodium channel activation, mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, abnormal exosomal miRs, abnormal gut microbiota, as well as increased renal SGLT2 activity. Treatment strategies in patients with hypertension with diabetes include lifestyle inter- ventions and the use of with pharmacological therapy, including RAAS blockade. Meanwhile, these patients may also benefit from treatment with GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors.
