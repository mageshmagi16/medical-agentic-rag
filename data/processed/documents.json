Gabbay, on behalf of the\nAmerican Diabetes Association\nDiabetes is a complex, chronic condition\nrequiring continuous medical care with\nmultifactorial risk-reduction strategies be-\nyond glucose management. Ongoing dia-\nbetes self-management education and\nsupport are critical to empowering peo-\nple, preventing acute complications, and\nreducing the risk of long-term complica-\ntions. Signi\ufb01cant evidence exists that\nsupports a range of interventions to im-\nprove diabetes outcomes.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\n\u201cStandards of Care in Diabetes,\u201d referred\nto here as the Standards of Care, is in-\ntended to provide clinicians, researchers,\npolicy makers, and other interested indi-\nviduals with the components of diabetes\ncare, general treatment goals, and tools\nto evaluate the quality of care.\nThe ADA Professional Practice Com-\nmittee (PPC) updates the Standards of\nCare annually and strives to include dis-\ncussion of emerging clinical considerations\nin the text, and as evidence evolves, clini-\ncal guidance is added to the recommen-\ndations in the Standards of Care. The\nStandards of Care is a \u201cliving\u201d document\nwhere important updates are published\nonline should the PPC determine that new\nevidence or regulatory changes (e.g., drug\nor technology approvals, label changes)\nmerit immediate inclusion. More informa-\ntion on the \u201cLiving Standards\u201d can be\nfound on the ADA professional website\nDiabetesPro at professional.diabetes.org/\ncontent-page/living-standards. The Stand-\nards of Care supersedes all previously\npublished ADA position statements\u2014and\nthe recommendations therein\u2014on clini-\ncal topics within the purview of the\nStandards of Care; while still containing\nvaluable analysis, ADA position state-\nments should not be considered the cur-\nrent position of the ADA. The Standards\nof Care receives annual review and ap-\nproval by the ADA Board of Directors and\nis reviewed by ADA staff and clinical lead-\nership. The Standards of Care also under-\ngoes external peer review annually.\nSCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES\nThe recommendations in the Standards\nof Care include screening, diagnostic,\nand therapeutic actions that are known\nor believed to favorably affect health\noutcomes of people with diabetes. They\nalso cover the prevention, screening, di-\nagnosis, and management of diabetes-\nassociated complications and comorbid-\nities. The recommendations encompass\ncare throughout the lifespan, for youth\n(children aged birth to 11 years and ado-\nlescents aged 12\u201317 years), adults (aged\n18\u201364 years), and older adults (aged\n$65 years). The recommendations cover\nthe management of type 1 diabetes, type 2\ndiabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus,\nand other types of diabetes.\nThe Standards of Care does not pro-\nvide comprehensive treatment plans for\ncomplications associated with diabetes,\nsuch as diabetic retinopathy or diabetic\nfoot ulcers, but offers guidance on how\nand when to screen for diabetes compli-\ncations, management of complications\nin the primary care and diabetes care\nsettings, and referral to specialists as\nappropriate. Similarly, regarding the psy-\nchosocial factors often associated with\ndiabetes and that can affect diabetes\ncare, the Standards of Care provides\nguidance on how and when to screen,\nmanagement in the primary care and\nThe \u201cStandards of Care in Diabetes,\u201d formerly called \u201cStandards of Medical Care in Diabetes,\u201d was originally approved in 1988.

    "text": "diabetes care settings, and referral but\ndoes not provide comprehensive manage-\nment plans for conditions that require\nspecialized care, such as mental illness.\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nThe target audience for the Standards of\nCare includes primary care physicians, en-\ndocrinologists, nurse practitioners, physi-\ncian\nassociates/assistants,\npharmacists,\ndietitians, and diabetes care and education\nspecialists. The Standards of Care also pro-\nvides guidance to specialists caring for peo-\nple with diabetes and its multitude of\ncomplications, such as cardiologists, neph-\nrologists, emergency physicians, internists,\npediatricians, psychologists, neurologists,\nophthalmologists, and podiatrists. Addi-\ntionally, these recommendations help\npayers, policy makers, researchers, re-\nsearch funding organizations, and advo-\ncacy groups to align their policies and\nresources and deliver optimal care for\npeople living with diabetes.\nThe ADA strives to improve and up-\ndate the Standards of Care to ensure\nthat clinicians, health plans, and policy\nmakers can continue to rely on it as\nthe most authoritative source for cur-\nrent guidelines for diabetes care. The\nStandards of Care recommendations\nare not intended to preclude clinical\njudgment. They must be applied in the\ncontext of excellent clinical care, with\nadjustments for individual preferences,\ncomorbidities, and other patient factors.\nFor more detailed information about the\nmanagement of diabetes, please refer to\nMedical Management of Type 1 Diabetes\n(1) and Medical Management of Type 2\nDiabetes (2).\nMETHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURE\nThe Standards of Care includes discussion\nof evidence and clinical practice recom-\nmendations intended to optimize care for\npeople with diabetes by assisting pro-\nviders and individuals in making shared\ndecisions about diabetes care. The recom-\nmendations are informed by a systematic\nreview of evidence and an assessment of\nthe bene\ufb01ts and risks of alternative care\noptions.\nProfessional Practice Committee\nThe PPC of the ADA is responsible for the\nStandards of Care. The PPC is a multidisci-\nplinary expert committee comprising physi-\ncians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists,\ndiabetes care and education specialists,\nregistered dietitian nutritionists, behavioral\nhealth scientists, and others who have ex-\npertise in a range of areas including but\nnot limited to adult/pediatric endocri-\nnology, epidemiology, public health,\nbehavioral health, cardiovascular risk\nmanagement, microvascular complica-\ntions, nephrology, neurology, ophthal-\nmology, podiatry, clinical pharmacology,\npreconception and pregnancy care, weight\nmanagement and diabetes prevention,\nand use of technology in diabetes man-\nagement. Appointment to the PPC is\nbased on excellence in clinical practice\nand research, with attention to appropri-\nate representation of members based on\nconsiderations including but not limited to\ndemographic, geographic, work setting, or\nidentity characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic-\nity, ability level). For the 2023 Standards of\nCare, as in previous years, two representa-\ntives from the American College of Cardi-\nology\n(ACC)\nacted\nas\nad\nhoc\nPPC\nmembers and reviewed and approved\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management.\u201d A PPC chairperson is\nappointed by the ADA (currently N.A.E.) for\na 1-year term and oversees the committee.\nEach section of the Standards of Care\nis reviewed annually and updated with\nthe latest evidence-based recommenda-\ntions by a PPC member designated as the\nsection lead as well as subcommittee\nmembers. The subcommittees perform\nsystematic literature reviews and iden-\ntify and summarize the scienti\ufb01c evi-\ndence. An information specialist with\nknowledge and experience in literature\nsearching (a librarian) is consulted as\nnecessary. A guideline methodologist\n(R.R.B. for the 2023 Standards of Care)\nwith expertise and training in evidence-\nbased medicine and guideline develop-\nment methodology oversees all methodo-\nlogical aspects of the development of the\nStandards of Care and serves as a statisti-\ncal analyst.\nDisclosure and Duality of Interest\nManagement\nAll members of the expert panel (the PPC\nmembers, ad hoc members, and subject\nmatter experts) and ADA staff are re-\nquired to comply with the ADA policy on\nduality of interest, which requires disclo-\nsure of any \ufb01nancial, intellectual, or other\ninterests that might be construed as con-\nstituting an actual, potential, or apparent\ncon\ufb02ict, regardless of relevancy to the\nguideline topic. For transparency, ADA re-\nquires full disclosure of all relationships.\nFull disclosure statements from all com-\nmittee members are solicited and re-\nviewed\nduring\nthe\nappointment\nprocess. Disclosures are then updated\nthroughout the guideline development\nprocess (speci\ufb01cally before the start of\nevery meeting), and disclosure state-\nments are submitted by every Stand-\nards of Care author upon submission of\nthe revised Standards of Care section.\nMembers are required to disclose for a\ntime frame that includes 1 year prior to\ninitiation of the committee appoint-\nment process until publication of that\nyear\u2019s Standards of Care. Potential dual-\nities of interest are evaluated by a des-\nignated review group and, if necessary,\nthe Legal Affairs Division of the ADA. The\nduality of interest assessment is based\non the relative weight of the \ufb01nancial re-\nlationship (i.e., the monetary amount)\nand the relevance of the relationship\n(i.e., the degree to which an independent\nobserver might reasonably interpret an\nassociation as related to the topic or rec-\nommendation of consideration). In addi-\ntion, the ADA adheres to Section 7 of the\nCouncil for Medical Specialty Societies\n\u201cCode for Interactions with Companies\u201d\n(3). The duality of interest review group\nalso ensures the majority of the PPC and\nthe PPC chair are without potential con-\n\ufb02ict relevant to the subject area. Further-\nmore, the PPC chair is required to remain\nuncon\ufb02icted for 1 year after the publica-\ntion of the Standards of Care. Members\nof the committee who disclose a poten-\ntial duality of interest pertinent to any\nspeci\ufb01c recommendation are prohibited\nfrom participating in discussions related\nto those recommendations. No expert\npanel members were employees of any\npharmaceutical or medical device com-\npany during the development of the\n2023 Standards of Care. Members of the\nPPC, their employers, and their disclosed\npotential dualities of interest are listed in\nthe section \u201cDisclosures: Standards of\nMedical Care in Diabetes\u20142023.\u201d The\nADA funds the development of the Stand-\nards of Care from general revenue and\ndoes not use industry support for this\npurpose.\nEvidence Review\nThe Standards of Care subcommittee for\neach section creates an initial list of\nS2\nIntroduction and Methodology\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

All Standards of Care recom-\nmendations receive a rating for the\nstrength of the evidence and not for the\nstrength of the recommendation. Recom-\nmendations with A-level evidence are\nbased on large, well-designed random-\nized controlled trials or well-done meta-\nanalyses of randomized controlled trials.\nGenerally, these recommendations have\nthe best chance of improving outcomes\nwhen applied to the population for which\nthey are appropriate. Recommendations\nwith lower levels of evidence may be\nequally important but are not as well\nsupported.\nOf course, published evidence is only\none component of clinical decision-making.\nClinicians care for people, not populations;\nguidelines must always be interpreted\nwith the individual person in mind. Indi-\nvidual circumstances, such as comorbid\nand coexisting diseases, age, education,\ndisability, and, above all, the values and\npreferences of the person with diabetes,\nmust be considered and may lead to dif-\nferent treatment targets and strategies.\nFurthermore, conventional evidence hier-\narchies, such as the one adapted by the\nADA, may miss nuances important in dia-\nbetes care. For example, although there\nis excellent evidence from clinical trials\nsupporting the importance of achieving\nmultiple risk factor control, the optimal\nway to achieve this result is less clear. It\nis dif\ufb01cult to assess each component of\nsuch a complex intervention.\nIn preparation of the 2023 Standards\nof Care, the expert panel met for a 2-day\nin-person/virtual meeting in Arlington,\nVirginia, in July 2022, to present the evi-\ndence summaries and to develop the rec-\nommendations. All PPC members participate\nannually in updating the Standards of Care\nand approve the recommendations therein.\nRevision Process\nPublic comment is particularly impor-\ntant in the development of clinical\npractice recommendations; it promotes\ntransparency and provides key stake\nholders the opportunity to identify and\naddress gaps in care. The ADA holds a\nyear-long public comment period re-\nquesting feedback on the Standards of\nCare. The PPC reviews compiled feedback\nfrom the public in preparation for the an-\nnual update but considers more pressing\nupdates throughout the year, which may\nbe published as \u201cliving\u201d Standards up-\ndates. Feedback from the larger clinical\ncommunity and general public was in-\nvaluable for the revision of the Standards\nof Care\u20142022. Readers who wish to\ncomment on the 2023 Standards of Care\nare invited to do so at professional.\ndiabetes.org/SOC.\nFeedback for the Standards of Care is\nalso obtained from external peer re-\nviewers. The Standards of Care is re-\nviewed by ADA clinical leadership and\nscienti\ufb01c and medical staff and is ap-\nproved by the ADA Board of Directors,\nwhich includes health care professionals,\nscientists, and lay people.

ADA Statements, Consensus Reports,\nand Scienti\ufb01c Reviews support the rec-\nommendations included in the Standards\nof Care.\nStandards of Care\nThe annual Standards of Care supplement\nto Diabetes Care contains the of\ufb01cial ADA\nposition, is authored by the ADA, and\nprovides all of the ADA\u2019s current clinical\npractice recommendations.\nADA Statement\nAn ADA statement is an of\ufb01cial ADA\npoint of view or belief that does not\ncontain clinical practice recommenda-\ntions and may be issued on advocacy,\npolicy, economic, or medical issues re-\nlated to diabetes. ADA statements un-\ndergo a formal review process, including\na review by the appropriate ADA national\ncommittee, ADA clinical leadership, sci-\nence and health care staff, and the ADA\nBoard of Directors.\nConsensus Report\nA consensus report on a particular topic\ncontains a comprehensive examination,\nis authored by an expert panel (i.e., con-\nsensus panel), and represents the panel\u2019s\ncollective analysis, evaluation, and opin-\nion. The need for a consensus report\narises when clinicians, scientists, regula-\ntors, and/or policy makers desire guidance\nand/or clarity on a medical or scienti\ufb01c is-\nsue related to diabetes for which the evi-\ndence is contradictory, emerging, or\nincomplete. Consensus reports may also\nhighlight evidence gaps and propose fu-\nture research areas to address these\ngaps. A consensus report is not an ADA\nposition but represents expert opinion\nonly and is produced under the aus-\npices of the ADA by invited experts. A\nconsensus report may be developed af-\nter an ADA Clinical Conference or Re-\nsearch Symposium.\nScientific Review\nA scienti\ufb01c review is a balanced review\nand analysis of the literature on a scien-\nti\ufb01c or medical topic related to diabetes.\nA scienti\ufb01c review is not an ADA position\nand does not contain clinical practice\nrecommendations but is produced under\nthe auspices of the ADA by invited ex-\nperts.

Gabbay, on behalf of\nthe American Diabetes Association\nGENERAL CHANGES\nThe \ufb01eld of diabetes care is rapidly chang-\ning as new research, technology, and\ntreatments that can improve the health\nand well-being of people with diabetes\ncontinue to emerge. With annual updates\nsince 1989, the American Diabetes Associ-\nation (ADA) has long been a leader in pro-\nducing guidelines that capture the most\ncurrent state of the \ufb01eld.\nThe 2023 Standards of Care includes\nrevisions to incorporate person-\ufb01rst and\ninclusive language. Efforts were made\nto consistently apply terminology that\nempowers people with diabetes and\nrecognizes the individual at the center\nof diabetes care.\nAlthough levels of evidence for several\nrecommendations have been updated,\nthese changes are not outlined below\nwhere the clinical recommendation has\nremained the same. That is, changes in\nevidence level from, for example, E to C\nare not noted below. The 2023 Standards\nof Care contains, in addition to many minor\nchanges that clarify recommendations or\nre\ufb02ect new evidence, more substantive\nrevisions detailed below.\nSECTION CHANGES\nSection 1. Improving Care and\nPromoting Health in Populations\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S001)\nRecommendation 1.7 was added to\naddress the use of community health\nworkers to support the management of\ndiabetes and cardiovascular risk factors,\nespecially in underserved communities\nand health care systems.\nAdditional language and de\ufb01nitions\nregarding digital health, telehealth, and\ntelemedicine were added, along with\nthe bene\ufb01ts of these modalities of care\ndelivery, including social determinants of\nhealth in the telehealth subsection.\nThe subsection \u201cAccess to Care and\nQuality Improvement\u201d was revised to add\nlanguage regarding value-based payments\nto listed quality improvement efforts.\nThe \u201cMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural\nWorkers\u201d subsection was updated to include\nmore recent data for this population.\nMore de\ufb01ning terms were added for\nnon-English speakers and diabetes educa-\ntion in the \u201cLanguage Barriers\u201d subsection.\nSection 2. Classification and\nDiagnosis of Diabetes\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S002)\nRecommendation 2.1b was added to the\n\u201cA1C\u201d subsection to address the utility of\npoint-of-care A1C testing for diabetes\nscreening and diagnosis.\nSection 3. Prevention or Delay of Type 2\nDiabetes and Associated Comorbidities\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S003)\nRecommendation 3.9 was added to ad-\ndress statin use and the risk of type 2 dia-\nbetes, including the recommendation to\nmonitor glucose status regularly and en-\nforce diabetes prevention approaches\nin individuals at high risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes who were prescribed\nstatin therapy.\nRecommendation 3.10 was added to\naddress the use of pioglitazone for reduc-\ning the risk of stroke or myocardial infarc-\ntion in people with history of stroke and\nevidence\nof\ninsulin\nresistance\nand\nprediabetes.\nRecommendation 3.12 was added to\ncommunicate that pharmacotherapy (e.g.,\nweight management, minimizing the pro-\ngression of hyperglycemia, cardiovascular\nrisk reduction) may be considered to sup-\nport person-centered care goals for people\nat high risk of developing diabetes.\nDisclosure information for each author is available at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G, Aroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.

Comprehensive Medical\nEvaluation and Assessment of\nComorbidities\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S004)\nIn Recommendation 4.3, language was\nmodi\ufb01ed to include evaluation for overall\nhealth status and setting of initial goals.\nConsiderable changes were made in\nthe immunizations subsection to re\ufb02ect\nnew indications and guidance, particu-\nlarly for COVID-19 and pneumococcal\npneumonia vaccinations, including age-\nspeci\ufb01c recommendations and the biva-\nlent COVID-19 booster.\nTable 4.1 was modi\ufb01ed to include\nchanges throughout Section 4.\nThe subsection \u201cNonalcoholic Fatty\nLiver Disease\u201d (NAFLD) incorporates more\ndetail regarding its diagnosis and risk\nstrati\ufb01cation in primary care and diabetes\nclinics, such as using the \ufb01brosis-4 index\nto assess the risk of liver \ufb01brosis, and in-\ncludes a \ufb01brosis-4 index risk calculator. It\nexpands on the rationale for \ufb01brosis risk\nstrati\ufb01cation in people with diabetes and\nwhen to refer to a gastroenterologist or\nhepatologist for further workup.\nDiscussion was added about the man-\nagement of people with type 2 diabetes\nwho have NAFLD, highlighting lifestyle\nchanges that promote weight loss, the\nuse of obesity pharmacotherapy with\nemphasis on treatment with glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists,\nbariatric surgery, and the role of diabe-\ntes medications (e.g., pioglitazone and\nGLP-1 receptor agonists) to treat people\nwith type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic\nfatty liver disease (NASH).\nRevisions to Section 4, including the\naddition of Fig. 4.2, are based on the\nAmerican Gastroenterological Association\n2021 \u201cPreparing for the NASH Epidemic:\nA Call to Action\u201d (reference 64 in this\nsection) and its associated \u201cClinical Care\nPathway for the Risk Strati\ufb01cation and\nManagement of Patients with Nonalco-\nholic Fatty Liver Disease\u201d (reference 66\nin this section), agreed upon by a multi-\ndisciplinary task force of experts, includ-\ning representatives of the ADA. Detailed\nrecommendations from an ADA consensus\nstatement will be published separately in\n2023.\nSection 5. Facilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S005)\nThe title has been changed from \u201cFacili-\ntating Behavior Change and Well-being\nto Improve Health Outcomes\u201d to be in-\nclusive of strength-based language.\nRecommendation 5.8 was added to the\n\u201cDiabetes Self-Management Education\nand Support\u201d subsection to address\nsocial determinants of health in guid-\ning design and delivery of diabetes\nself-management education and sup-\nport (DSMES). Additional information\nwas also added supporting use of tele-\nhealth delivery of care and other digital\nhealth solutions to deliver DSMES.\nScreening for food insecurity by any\nmembers of the health care team was\nadded to the nutrition section.\nA section on intermittent fasting and\ntime-restricted eating was included in\nthe \u201cEating Patterns and Meal Planning\u201d\nsubsection.\nEmphasis was placed on supporting\nlarger weight losses (up to 15%) based on\nef\ufb01cacy and access of newer medications.\nLanguage was added to Recommenda-\ntion 5.23 about the harms of b-carotene\nsupplementation based on the U.S. Pre-\nventative Services Task Force report.\nThe new subsection \u201cSupporting Posi-\ntive Health Behaviors\u201d was added, in-\ncluding the addition of Recommendation\n5.37, which encourages use of behav-\nioral strategies by members of the diabe-\ntes care team, with the goal to support\ndiabetes self-management and engage-\nment in health behaviors to promote op-\ntimal diabetes health outcomes.\nThe \u201cPsychosocial Issues\u201d subsection\nwas renamed \u201cPsychosocial Care\u201d to high-\nlight the recommendations\u2019 emphasis on\nproviding appropriate psychosocial sup-\nport to people with diabetes as part of\nor in conjunction with standard diabetes\ncare.\nThe \u201cPsychosocial Care\u201d subsection in-\ncludes a new Recommendation 5.55 to\nscreen for sleep health in people with di-\nabetes and make referrals to sleep medi-\ncine and/or quali\ufb01ed behavioral health\nprofessional as indicated.\nOther recommendations in this sub-\nsection were revised to specify the roles\nof diabetes care professionals as well as\nquali\ufb01ed mental/behavioral health pro-\nfessionals to provide psychosocial care,\nto specify topics for psychosocial scree-\nning, treatment, and referrals when indi-\ncated, and to include caregivers and\nfamily members of people with dia-\nbetes. Details were added about re-\nsources for developing psychosocial\nscreening protocols and about inter-\nvention. Across the speci\ufb01c psychoso-\ncial domains (e.g., diabetes distress,\nanxiety), details were added about\ndata supporting intervention and care\napproaches to support psychosocial and\nbehavioral outcomes in people with dia-\nbetes and their family members.\nSection 6. Glycemic Targets\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S006)\nNew language was added to Recom-\nmendation 6.5b to outline that for\nthose with frailty or at high risk of hy-\npoglycemia, a target of >50% time in\nrange with <1% time below range is\nnow recommended.\nRecommendation 6.9 was added to\naddress the effectiveness of goal setting\nfor glycemic control.\nSection 7. Diabetes Technology\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S007)\nThe importance of \u201cpreference\u201d for\ndiabetes devices was added in all\nrecommendations.\nRecommendation 7.12 for the use of\ncontinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in\nadults with diabetes treated with basal\ninsulin was reworded to re\ufb02ect updated\nevidence in the literature.\nRecommendation 7.15 was modi\ufb01ed\nto state that people with diabetes\nshould have uninterrupted access to\ntheir supplies to minimize gaps in CGM\nuse.\nRecommendation 7.19 was added to\naddress CGM interfering substances, with\nevidence level C.\nA new paragraph addressing substan-\nces and factors affecting CGM accuracy\nwas added to the \u201cContinuous Glucose\nMonitoring Devices\u201d subsection. Table\n7.4 was added to address interfering\nsubstances for CGM.\nInformation was added on all three\nintegrated CGM devices available, and it\nwas speci\ufb01ed that although there is more\nthan one CGM system approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nfor use with automated insulin delivery\nsystems, only one system with integrated\nCGM designation is FDA approved for\nS6\nSummary of Revisions\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Obesity and Weight\nManagement for the Prevention and\nTreatment of Type 2 Diabetes\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S008)\nLanguage was amended to reinforce that\nobesity is a chronic disease.\nRecommendation 8.5 was added to re-\ninforce that both small and larger weight\nlosses should be considered as treatment\ngoals on a case-by-case basis. Notably,\nlarger (10% or more) weight loss may\nhave disease-modifying effects, including\ndiabetes remission, and may improve\nlong-term cardiovascular outcomes.\nDual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insuli-\nnotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor ago-\nnist (tirzepatide) was added as a glucose-\nlowering option with the potential for\nweight loss.\nSection 9. Pharmacologic\nApproaches to Glycemic Treatment\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S009)\nSection 9 was updated to align with the\nlatest consensus report on management\nof hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes by\nthe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nand the European Association for the\nStudy of Diabetes (EASD). Recommenda-\ntion 9.4a was added to state that\nhealthy lifestyle behaviors, DSMES, avoi-\ndance of clinical inertia, and social deter-\nminants of health (SDOH) should be\nconsidered in the glucose-lowering man-\nagement of type 2 diabetes.\nRecommendation 9.4b was added to\nindicate that in adults with type 2 diabe-\ntes and established/high risk of atheroscle-\nrotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure,\nand/or chronic kidney disease, the treat-\nment plan should include agents that re-\nduce cardiorenal risk.\nRecommendation 9.4c was added to\naddress the consideration of pharmaco-\nlogic approaches that provide the ef\ufb01-\ncacy to achieve treatment goals.\nRecommendation 9.4d was added to\naddress weight management as an im-\npactful component of glucose-lowering\nmanagement in type 2 diabetes.\nInformation was added to address\nconsiderations for a GLP-1 receptor ago-\nnist prior to prandial insulin to further\naddress prandial control and to minimize\nthe risks of hypoglycemia and weight\ngain associated with insulin therapy.\nInformation was added to address al-\nternative insulin routes.\nTable 9.2 and Fig. 9.3 were updated\nbased on the latest consensus report on\nmanagement of hyperglycemia in type 2\ndiabetes by the ADA and the EASD.\nSection 10. Cardiovascular Disease\nand Risk Management\n(https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S010)\nRecommendation 10.1 was revised with\nupdated de\ufb01nitions of hypertension. These\nrecommendations align with the current\nde\ufb01nition of hypertension according to\nthe American College of Cardiology and\nAmerican Heart Association.\nRecommendation 10.4 on blood pres-\nsure treatment goals in individuals with\ndiabetes was revised to target a blood\npressure of <130/80 mmHg. The discus-\nsion of the evidence to support this rec-\nommendation was extensively revised. In\naddition, the recently reported results of\nthe STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Inter-\nvention in the Elderly Hypertensive Pa-\ntients) trial were added.

    "text": "each patient. Thus, efforts to improve\npopulation health will require a combi-\nnation of policy-level, system-level, and\npatient-level approaches. With such an\nintegrated approach in mind, the Ameri-\ncan Diabetes Association (ADA) highlights\nthe importance of patient-centered care,\nde\ufb01ned as care that considers individual\npatient comorbidities and prognoses; is\nrespectful of and responsive to patient\npreferences, needs, and values; and en-\nsures that patient values guide all clinical\ndecisions (2). Furthermore, social deter-\nminants of health (SDOH)\u2014often out of\ndirect control of the individual and poten-\ntially representing lifelong risk\u2014contribute\nto health care and psychosocial outcomes\nand must be addressed to improve all\nhealth outcomes (3). Clinical practice rec-\nommendations, whether based on evi-\ndence or expert opinion, are intended\nto guide an overall approach to care.\nThe science and art of health care come\ntogether when the clinician makes treat-\nment decisions for a patient who may\nnot meet the eligibility criteria used in\nthe studies on which guidelines are\nbased. Recognizing that one size does\nnot \ufb01t all, the standards presented here\nprovide guidance for when and how to\nadapt recommendations for an individual.\nThis section provides guidance for health\ncare professionals as well as health sys-\ntems and policymakers.\nCare Delivery Systems\nThe proportion of people with diabetes\nwho achieve recommended A1C, blood\npressure, and LDL cholesterol levels has\n\ufb02uctuated over the years (4). Glycemic\nmanagement and management of cho-\nlesterol through dietary intake remain\nchallenging. In 2013\u20132016, 64% of adults\nwith diagnosed diabetes met individual-\nized A1C target levels, 70% achieved rec-\nommended blood pressure target, 57%\nmet the LDL cholesterol target level, and\n85% were nonsmokers (4). However,\nonly 23% met targets for glycemic, blood\npressure, and LDL cholesterol measures\nwhile also avoiding smoking (4). The\nmean A1C nationally among people with\ndiabetes increased slightly from 7.3% in\n2005\u20132008 to 7.5% in 2013\u20132016 based\non the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES), with youn-\nger adults, women, and non-Hispanic\nBlack individuals less likely to meet\ntreatment targets (4). Certain segments\nof the population, such as young adults\nand individuals with complex comorbid-\nities, \ufb01nancial or other social hardships,\nand/or limited English pro\ufb01ciency, face\nparticular challenges to goal-based care\n(5\u20137). Even after adjusting for these\npatient factors, the persistent variability\nin the quality of diabetes care across\nhealth care professionals and prac-\ntice settings indicates that substan-\ntial system-level improvements are\nstill needed.\nDiabetes poses a signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nancial\nburden to individuals and society. It is es-\ntimated that the annual cost of diagnosed\ndiabetes in the U.S. in 2017 was $327 bil-\nlion, including $237 billion in direct health\ncare costs and $90 billion in reduced pro-\nductivity. After adjusting for in\ufb02ation, the\neconomic costs of diabetes increased by\n26% from 2012 to 2017 (8). This is attrib-\nuted to the increased prevalence of dia-\nbetes and the increased cost per person\nwith diabetes. Therefore, on going popu-\nlation health strategies are needed to re-\nduce costs and provide optimized care.\nChronic Care Model\nNumerous interventions to promote the\nrecommended standards have been im-\nplemented. However, a major barrier to\noptimal care is a delivery system that\nis often fragmented, lacks clinical infor-\nmation capabilities, duplicates services,\nand is poorly designed for the coordi-\nnated delivery of chronic care. The\nChronic Care Model (CCM) takes these\nfactors into consideration and is an effec-\ntive framework for improving the quality\nof diabetes care (9).\nSix Core Elements. The CCM includes six\ncore elements to optimize the care of\npeople with chronic disease:\n1. Delivery system design (moving from\na reactive to a proactive care deliv-\nery system where planned visits are\ncoordinated through a team-based\napproach)\n2. Self-management support\n3. Decision support (basing care on evi-\ndence-based, effective care guidelines)\n4. Clinical information systems (using\nregistries that can provide patient-\nspeci\ufb01c and population-based support\nto the care team)\n5. Community resources and policies\n(identifying or developing resources\nto support healthy lifestyles)\n6. Health systems (to create a quality-\noriented culture)\nA 5-year effectiveness study of the\nCCM in 53,436 people with type 2 diabe-\ntes in the primary care setting suggested\nthat the use of this model of care delivery\nreduced the cumulative incidence of\ndiabetes-related complications and all-\ncause mortality (10). Patients who were\nenrolled in the CCM experienced a re-\nduction in cardiovascular disease risk by\n56.6%, microvascular complications by\n11.9%, and mortality by 66.1% (10). In\naddition, another study suggested that\nhealth care utilization was lower in the\nCCM group, which resulted in health care\nsavings of $7,294 per individual over the\nstudy period (11).\nRede\ufb01ning the roles of the health care\ndelivery team and empowering patient\nself-management are fundamental to the\nsuccessful implementation of the CCM\n(12). Collaborative, multidisciplinary teams\nare best suited to provide care for people\nwith chronic conditions such as diabetes\nand to facilitate patients\u2019 self-management\n(13\u201315). There are references to guide the\nimplementation of the CCM into diabetes\ncare delivery, including opportunities and\nchallenges (16).\nStrategies for System-Level Improvement\nOptimal diabetes management requires\nan organized, systematic approach and\nthe involvement of a coordinated team\nof dedicated health care professionals\nworking in an environment where patient-\ncentered, high-quality care is a priority\n(7,16,17). While many diabetes care pro-\ncesses have improved nationally in the\npast decade, the overall quality of care\nfor people with diabetes remains subop-\ntimal (4). Efforts to increase the quality\nof diabetes care include providing care\nthat is concordant with evidence-based\nguidelines (18); expanding the role of\nteams to implement more intensive dis-\nease management strategies (7,19,20);\ntracking medication-taking behavior at a\nsystems level (21); redesigning the orga-\nnization of the care process (22); imple-\nmenting electronic health record tools\n(23,24); empowering and educating\npatients (25,26); removing \ufb01nancial\nbarriers and reducing patient out-of-\npocket costs for diabetes education,\neye exams, diabetes technology, and\nnecessary medications (7); assessing and\naddressing psychosocial issues (27,28);\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nImproving Care and Promoting Health in Populations\nS11\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "and identifying, developing, and engaging\ncommunity resources and public policies\nthat support healthy lifestyles (29). The\nNational Diabetes Education Program\nmaintains an online resource (cdc.gov/\ndiabetes/professional-info/training.html)\nto help health care professionals design\nand implement more effective health\ncare delivery systems for those with dia-\nbetes. Given the pluralistic needs of peo-\nple with diabetes and that the constant\nchallenges they experience vary over the\ncourse of disease management (complex\ninsulin treatment plans, new technology,\netc.), a diverse team with complementary\nexpertise is consistently recommended\n(30).\nCare Teams\nThe care team, which centers around the\npatient, should avoid therapeutic inertia\nand prioritize timely and appropriate\nintensi\ufb01cation of behavior change (nutri-\ntion and physical activity) and/or phar-\nmacologic therapy for patients who have\nnot achieved the recommended meta-\nbolic targets (31\u201333). Strategies shown\nto improve care team behavior and\nthereby catalyze reductions in A1C, blood\npressure, and/or LDL cholesterol include\nengaging in explicit and collaborative goal\nsetting with patients (34,35); integrating\nevidence-based guidelines and clinical\ninformation tools into the process of\ncare (18,36,37); identifying and addressing\nlanguage, numeracy, or cultural barriers\nto care (37\u201339); soliciting performance\nfeedback, setting reminders, and provid-\ning structured care (e.g., guidelines, formal\ncase management, and patient education\nresources) (7); and incorporating care\nmanagement teams including nurses, die-\ntitians, pharmacists, and other health\ncare professionals (19,38). In addition,\ninitiatives such as the Patient-Centered\nMedical Home can improve health out-\ncomes by fostering comprehensive primary\ncare and offering new opportunities for\nteam-based chronic disease management\n(39).\nTelehealth\nTelehealth is a growing \ufb01eld that may\nincrease access to care for people with\ndiabetes. The American Telemedicine\nAssociation de\ufb01nes telemedicine as the\nuse of medical information exchanged\nfrom one site to another via electronic\ncommunications to improve a patient\u2019s\nclinical health status. Telehealth includes\na growing variety of applications and\nservices using two-way video, smartphones,\nwireless tools, and other forms of tele-\ncommunications technology (40). Often\nused interchangeably with telemedicine,\ntelehealth describes a broader range of\ndigital health services in health care deliv-\nery (41). This includes synchronous, asyn-\nchronous, and remote patient monitoring.\nTelehealth should be used comple-\nmentary to in-person visits to optimize\nglycemic management in people with\nunmanaged diabetes (42). Increasingly,\nevidence suggests that various telehealth\nmodalities may facilitate reducing A1C in\npeople with type 2 diabetes compared\nwith usual care or in addition to usual\ncare (43), and \ufb01ndings suggest that tele-\nmedicine is a safe method of delivering\ntype 1 diabetes care to rural patients\n(44). For rural populations or those with\nlimited physical access to health care,\ntelemedicine has a growing body of evi-\ndence for its effectiveness, particularly\nwith regard to glycemic management as\nmeasured by A1C (45\u201347). In addition,\nevidence supports the effectiveness of\ntelehealth in diabetes, hypertension, and\ndyslipidemia interventions (48) as well\nas the telehealth delivery of motivational\ninterviewing (49). Interactive strategies\nthat facilitate communication between\nhealth care professionals and patients,\nincluding the use of web-based portals\nor text messaging and those that incor-\nporate medication adjustment, appear\nmore effective. Telehealth and other vir-\ntual environments can also be used to\noffer diabetes self-management educa-\ntion and clinical support and remove\ngeographic and transportation barriers\nfor patients living in underresourced\nareas or with disabilities (50). Telehealth\nresources can also have a role in ad-\ndressing the\nsocial\ndeterminants\nof\nhealth in young adults with diabetes\n(51). However, limited data are available\non the effectiveness across different pop-\nulations (52).\nBehaviors and Well-being\nSuccessful diabetes care also requires\na systematic approach to supporting\npatients\u2019 behavior change efforts. High-\nquality diabetes self-management edu-\ncation and support (DSMES) has been\nshown to improve patient self-management,\nsatisfaction, and glucose outcomes. Na-\ntional DSMES standards call for an inte-\ngrated approach that includes clinical\ncontent and skills, behavioral strategies\n(goal setting, problem-solving), and en-\ngagement with psychosocial concerns.\nIncreasingly, such support is being ada-\npted for online platforms that have the\npotential to promote patient access to\nthis important resource. These curricu-\nlums need to be tailored to the needs of\nthe intended populations, including ad-\ndressing the \u201cdigital divide,\u201d i.e., access\nto the technology required for imple-\nmentation (53\u201356).\nFor more information on DSMES, see\nSection 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes.\u201d\nCost Considerations for Medication-Taking\nBehaviors\nThe cost of diabetes medications and\ndevices is an ongoing barrier to achiev-\ning glycemic goals. Up to 25% of pa-\ntients who are prescribed insulin report\ncost-related insulin underuse (57). Insu-\nlin underuse due to cost has also been\ntermed \u201ccost-related medication non-\nadherence\u201d (here referrred to as cost-\nrelated barriers to medication use). The\ncost of insulin has continued to in-\ncrease in recent years for reasons that\nare not entirely clear. There are recom-\nmendations from the ADA Insulin Access\nand Affordability Working Group for ap-\nproaches to this issue from a systems\nlevel (58). Recommendations including\nconcepts such as cost-sharing for insured\npeople with diabetes should be based on\nthe lowest price available, the list price\nfor insulins that closely re\ufb02ects the net\nprice, and health plans that ensure\npeople with diabetes can access insulin\nwithout undue administrative burden or\nexcessive cost (58).\nThe cost of medications (not only in-\nsulin) in\ufb02uences prescribing patterns and\nmedication use because of patient bur-\nden and lack of secondary payer support\n(public and private insurance) for effective\napproved glucose-lowering, cardiovascular\ndisease risk-reducing, and weight man-\nagement therapeutics. Financial barriers\nremain a major source of health dispar-\nities, and costs should be a focus of treat-\nment goals (59). (See TAILORING TREATMENT FOR\nSOCIAL CONTEXT and TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS.)\nReduction in cost-related barriers to\nmedication use is associated with better\nbiologic and psychologic outcomes, in-\ncluding quality of life.\nS12\nImproving Care and Promoting Health in Populations\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Access to Care and Quality Improvement\nThe Affordable Care Act and Medicaid\nexpansion have increased access to\ncare for many individuals with diabetes,\nemphasizing the protection of people\nwith preexisting conditions, health pro-\nmotion, and disease prevention (60). In\nfact, health insurance coverage increased\nfrom 84.7% in 2009 to 90.1% in 2016 for\nadults with diabetes aged 18\u201364 years.\nCoverage for those aged $65 years re-\nmained nearly universal (61). Patients\nwho have either private or public in-\nsurance coverage are more likely to\nmeet quality indicators for diabetes\ncare (62). As mandated by the Afford-\nable Care Act, the Agency for Health-\ncare Research and Quality developed a\nNational Quality Strategy based on tri-\nple aims that include improving the\nhealth of a population, overall quality and\npatient experience of care, and per cap-\nita cost (63,64). As health care systems\nand practices adapt to the changing\nlandscape of health care, it will be\nimportant to integrate traditional dis-\nease-speci\ufb01c metrics with measures of\npatient experience, as well as cost, in\nassessing the quality of diabetes care\n(65,66). Information and guidance spe-\nci\ufb01c to quality improvement and prac-\ntice transformation for diabetes care are\navailable from the National Institute of\nDiabetes and Digestive and Kidney Dis-\neases guidance on diabetes care and\nquality (67). Using patient registries and\nelectronic health records, health systems\ncan evaluate the quality of diabetes care\nbeing delivered and perform intervention\ncycles as part of quality improvement\nstrategies (68). Improvement of health\nliteracy and numeracy is also a necessary\ncomponent to improve care (69,70). Crit-\nical to these efforts is health professional\nadherence to clinical practice recommen-\ndations (Table 4.1) and the use of accu-\nrate, reliable data metrics that include\nsociodemographic variables to examine\nhealth equity within and across popula-\ntions (71).\nIn addition to quality improvement\nefforts, other strategies that simulta-\nneously improve the quality of care\nand potentially reduce costs are gaining\nmomentum and include reimbursement\nstructures that, in contrast to visit-based\nbilling, reward the provision of appropri-\nate and high-quality care to achieve\nmetabolic goals (72), value-based pay-\nments, and incentives that accommodate\npersonalized care goals (7,73). (Also see\nCOST\nCONSIDERATIONS\nFOR\nMEDICATION-TAKING\nBEHAVIORS, above, regarding cost-related\nbarriers to medication use.)\nTAILORING TREATMENT FOR\nSOCIAL CONTEXT\nRecommendations\n1.5 Assess food insecurity, housing\ninsecurity/homelessness, \ufb01nancial\nbarriers, and social capital/social\ncommunity support to inform\ntreatment decisions, with refer-\nral to appropriate local commu-\nnity resources. A\n1.6 Provide patients with additional\nself-management support from\nlay health coaches, navigators, or\ncommunity health workers when\navailable. A\n1.7 Consider the involvement of com-\nmunity health workers to support\nthe management of diabetes and\ncardiovascular risk factors, espe-\ncially in underserved communities\nand health care systems. B\nHealth inequities related to diabetes\nand its complications are well docu-\nmented, are heavily in\ufb02uenced by SDOH,\nand have been associated with greater\nrisk for diabetes, higher population prev-\nalence, and poorer diabetes outcomes\n(74\u201378). SDOH are de\ufb01ned as the eco-\nnomic, environmental, political, and so-\ncial conditions in which people live and\nare responsible for a major part of health\ninequality worldwide (79). Greater expo-\nsure to adverse SDOH over the life course\nresults in worse health (80). The ADA rec-\nognizes the association between social\nand environmental factors and the pre-\nvention and treatment of diabetes and\nhas issued a call for research that seeks\nto understand better how these social\ndeterminants in\ufb02uence behaviors and\nhow the relationships between these\nvariables might be modi\ufb01ed for the pre-\nvention and management of diabetes\n(81,82). While a comprehensive strategy\nto reduce diabetes-related health inequi-\nties in populations has not been formally\nstudied, general recommendations from\nother chronic disease management and\nprevention models can be drawn upon\nto inform systems-level strategies in dia-\nbetes (83). For example, the National\nAcademy of Medicine has published a\nframework for educating health care\nprofessionals on the importance of\nSDOH (84). Furthermore, there are re-\nsources available for the inclusion of stan-\ndardized sociodemographic variables in\nelectronic health records to facilitate the\nmeasurement of health inequities and\nthe impact of interventions designed to\nreduce those inequities (65,84,85).\nSDOH are not consistently recognized\nand often go undiscussed in the clinical\nencounter (77). Among people with\nchronic illnesses, two-thirds of those who\nreported not taking medications as pre-\nscribed due to cost-related barriers to\nmedication use never shared this with\ntheir physician (86). In a study using data\nfrom the National Health Interview Sur-\nvey (NHIS), Patel et al. (77) found that\none-half of adults with diabetes reported\n\ufb01nancial stress and one-\ufb01fth reported\nfood insecurity. A recent Canadian study\nnoted an association of one or more ad-\nverse SDOH and health care utilization\nand poor diabetes outcomes in high-risk\nchildren with type 1 diabetes (86).\nAnother population in which such is-\nsues must be considered is older adults,\nwhere social dif\ufb01culties may impair\nquality of life and increase the risk of func-\ntional dependency (87) (see Section 13,\n\u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for a detailed discussion\nof social considerations in older adults).\nCreating systems-level mechanisms to\nscreen for SDOH may help overcome\nstructural barriers and communication\ngaps between patients and health care\nprofessionals (77,88). In addition, brief,\nvalidated screening tools for some SDOH\nexist and could facilitate discussion around\nfactors that signi\ufb01cantly impact treatment\nduring the clinical encounter. Below is\na discussion of assessment and treat-\nment considerations in the context of\nfood insecurity, homelessness, limited\nEnglish pro\ufb01ciency, limited health literacy,\nand low literacy.\nFood Insecurity\nFood insecurity is the unreliable avail-\nability of nutritious food and the inabil-\nity to consistently obtain food without\nresorting to socially unacceptable practi-\nces. Over 18% of the U.S. population re-\nported food insecurity between 2005\nand 2014 (89). The rate is higher in some\nracial/ethnic minority groups, including\nAfrican American and Latino populations,\nlow-income households, and homes\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nImproving Care and Promoting Health in Populations\nS13\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "headed by single mothers. The food\ninsecurity rate in individuals with diabe-\ntes may be up to 20% (90). Additionally,\nthe risk for type 2 diabetes is increased\ntwofold in those with food insecurity\n(81) and has been associated with lower\nengagement in self-care behaviors and\nmedication use, depression, diabetes\ndistress, and worse glycemic manage-\nment when compared with individuals\nwho are food secure (91\u201393). Older\nadults with food insecurity are more\nlikely to have emergency department\nvisits\nand\nhospitalizations\ncompared\nwith older adults who do not report\nfood insecurity (94). Risk for food inse-\ncurity can be assessed with a validated\ntwo-item screening tool (95) that in-\ncludes\nthe\nfollowing\nstatements:\n1)\n\u201cWithin the past 12 months, we wor-\nried whether our food would run out\nbefore we got money to buy more\u201d and\n2) \u201cWithin the past 12 months the food\nwe bought just didn\u2019t last, and we didn\u2019t\nhave money to get more.\u201d An af\ufb01rma-\ntive response to either statement had a\nsensitivity of 97% and speci\ufb01city of 83%.\nInterventions such as food prescription\nprograms are considered promising to\naddress food insecurity by integrating\ncommunity resources into primary care\nsettings and directly dealing with food de-\nserts in underserved communities (96,97).\nTreatment Considerations\nIn those with diabetes and food insecu-\nrity, the priority is mitigating the increased\nrisk for uncontrolled hyperglycemia and\nsevere hypoglycemia. The reasons for the\nincreased risk of hyperglycemia include\nthe steady consumption of inexpensive\ncarbohydrate-rich processed foods, binge\neating, \ufb01nancial constraints to \ufb01lling dia-\nbetes medication prescriptions, and anxi-\nety/depression leading to poor diabetes\nself-care behaviors. Hypoglycemia can\noccur due to inadequate or erratic car-\nbohydrate consumption following the\nadministration of sulfonylureas or insu-\nlin. See Table 9.2 for drug-speci\ufb01c and\npatient factors, including cost and risk\nof hypoglycemia, which may be impor-\ntant considerations for adults with food\ninsecurity and type 2 diabetes. Health\ncare professionals should consider these\nfactors when making treatment deci-\nsions for people with food insecurity\nand seek local resources to help people\nwith diabetes and their family members\nobtain nutritious food more regularly\n(98).\nHomelessness and Housing Insecurity\nHomelessness/housing insecurity often\naccompanies many additional barriers\nto diabetes self-management, including\nfood insecurity, literacy and numeracy\nde\ufb01ciencies, lack of insurance, cognitive\ndysfunction, and mental health issues\n(99). The prevalence of diabetes in the\nhomeless population is estimated to be\naround 8% (100). Additionally, people\nwith diabetes who are homeless need\nsecure places to keep their diabetes sup-\nplies and refrigerator access to properly\nstore their insulin and take it on a regu-\nlar schedule. The risk for homelessness\ncan be ascertained using a brief risk as-\nsessment tool developed and validated\nfor use among veterans (101). Housing\ninsecurity has also been shown to be\ndirectly associated with a person\u2019s ability\nto maintain their diabetes self-manage-\nment (102). Given the potential chal-\nlenges, health care professionals who\ncare for either homeless or housing-\ninsecure individuals should be familiar\nwith resources or have access to social\nworkers who can facilitate stable housing\nfor their patients as a way to improve di-\nabetes care (103).\nMigrant and Seasonal Agricultural\nWorkers\nMigrant and seasonal agricultural work-\ners may have a higher risk of type 2 dia-\nbetes than the overall population. While\nmigrant farmworker\u2013speci\ufb01c data are\nlacking, most agricultural workers in the\nU.S. are Latino, a population with a high\nrate of type 2 diabetes. In addition, living\nin severe poverty brings with it food in-\nsecurity, high chronic stress, and an in-\ncreased risk of diabetes; there is also an\nassociation between the use of certain\npesticides and the incidence of diabetes\n(104).\nData from the Department of Labor\nindicate that there are 2.5\u20133 million ag-\nricultural workers in the U.S. These agri-\ncultural workers travel throughout the\ncountry, serving as the backbone for a\nmultibillion-dollar agricultural industry.\nAccording to 2021 health center data,\n175 health centers across the U.S. re-\nported that they provided health care\nservices to 893,260 adult agricultural\npatients, and 91,124 had encounters for\ndiabetes (10.2%) (105).\nMigrant farmworkers encounter nu-\nmerous and overlapping barriers to re-\nceiving care. Migration, which may occur\nas frequently as every few weeks for\nfarmworkers, disrupts care. In addition,\ncultural and linguistic barriers, lack of\ntransportation and money, lack of avail-\nable work hours, unfamiliarity with new\ncommunities, lack of access to resour-\nces, and other barriers prevent migrant\nfarmworkers from accessing health care.\nWithout regular care, those with diabetes\nmay suffer severe and often expensive\ncomplications that affect quality of life.\nHealth care professionals should be\nattuned to all patients\u2019 working and liv-\ning conditions. For example, if a migrant\nfarmworker with diabetes presents for\ncare, appropriate referrals should be ini-\ntiated to social workers and community\nresources, as available, to assist with re-\nmoving barriers to care.\nLanguage Barriers\nHealth care professionals who care for\nnon\u2013English speakers should develop or\noffer educational programs and materi-\nals in languages speci\ufb01c to these patients\nwith the speci\ufb01c goals of preventing dia-\nbetes and building diabetes awareness in\npeople who cannot easily read or write in\nEnglish. The National Standards for Cultur-\nally and Linguistically Appropriate Services\nin Health and Health Care (National CLAS\nStandards) provide guidance on how\nhealth care professionals can reduce\nlanguage barriers by improving their\ncultural competency, addressing health\nliteracy, and ensuring communication\nwith language assistance (106). In addi-\ntion, the National CLAS Standards web-\nsite (thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov) offers\nseveral resources and materials that can\nbe used to improve the quality of care\ndelivery to non\u2013English-speaking patients\n(106).\nHealth Literacy and Numeracy\nHealth literacy is de\ufb01ned as the degree\nto which individuals have the capacity\nto obtain, process, and understand basic\nhealth information and services needed\nto make appropriate decisions (69).\nHealth literacy is strongly associated\nwith patients engaging in complex dis-\nease management and self-care (107).\nApproximately 80 million adults in the\nU.S. are estimated to have limited or\nlow health literacy (70).

    "text": "diabetes care and education specialists\nshould ensure they provide easy-\nto-understand information and reduce\nunnecessary complexity when develop-\ning care plans with patients. Interven-\ntions addressing low health literacy in\npopulations with diabetes seem effec-\ntive in improving diabetes outcomes, in-\ncluding ones focusing primarily on patient\neducation, self-care training, or disease\nmanagement. Combining easily adapted\nmaterials with formal diabetes education\ndemonstrates effectiveness on clinical\nand behavioral outcomes in populations\nwith low literacy (108). However, evi-\ndence supporting these strategies is\nlargely limited to observational studies.\nMore research is needed to investigate\nthe most effective strategies for enhanc-\ning both acquisition and retention of di-\nabetes knowledge and examine different\nmedia and strategies for delivering inter-\nventions to patients (109).\nHealth numeracy is also essential in\ndiabetes prevention and management.\nHealth numeracy requires primary nu-\nmeric skills, applied health numeracy, and\ninterpretive health numeracy. An emo-\ntional component also affects a per-\nson\u2019s ability to understand concepts of\nrisk, probability, and communication of\nscienti\ufb01c evidence (110). People with pre-\ndiabetes or diabetes often need to per-\nform numeric tasks such as interpreting\nfood labels and blood glucose levels to\nmake treatment decisions such as medi-\ncation dosing. Thus, both health literacy\nand numeracy are necessary for enabling\neffective communication between patient\nand health professional, arriving at a\ntreatment plan, and making diabetes\nself-management task decisions. If pa-\ntients appear not to understand concepts\nassociated with treatment decisions, both\ncan be assessed using standardized screen-\ning measures (111). Adjunctive education\nand support may be indicated if limited\nhealth literacy and numeracy are barriers\nto optimal care decisions (27).\nSocial Capital/Community Support\nSocial capital, which comprises commu-\nnity and personal network instrumental\nsupport, promotes better health, whereas\nlack of social support is associated with\npoorer health outcomes in individuals\nwith diabetes (82). Of particular con-\ncern are the SDOH, including racism\nand discrimination, which are likely to\nbe lifelong (112). These factors are rarely\naddressed in routine treatment or disease\nmanagement but may be underlying\nreasons for lower engagement in self-\ncare behaviors and medication use.\nIdenti\ufb01cation or development of com-\nmunity resources to support healthy\nlifestyles is a core element of the CCM\n(9), with a particular need to incorporate\nrelevant social support networks. There is\ncurrently a paucity of evidence regarding\nenhancing these resources for those\nmost likely to bene\ufb01t from such interven-\ntion strategies.\nHealth care community linkages are\nreceiving increasing attention from the\nAmerican Medical Association, the Agency\nfor Healthcare Research and Quality, and\nothers to promote the translation of clini-\ncal recommendations for nutrition and\nphysical activity in real-world settings\n(113). Community health workers (CHWs)\n(114), peer supporters (115\u2013117), and\nlay leaders (118) may assist in the deliv-\nery of DSMES services (84,119), particu-\nlarly in underserved communities. The\nAmerican Public Health Association de-\n\ufb01nes a CHW as a \u201cfrontline public health\nworker who is a trusted member of and/\nor has an unusually close understanding\nof the community served\u201d (120). CHWs\ncan be part of a cost-effective, evidence-\nbased strategy to improve the manage-\nment of diabetes and cardiovascular\nrisk factors in underserved communities\nand health care systems (121). The\nCHW scope of practice in areas such as\noutreach and communication, advocacy,\nsocial support, basic health education,\nreferrals to community clinics, etc., has\nsuccessfully provided social and primary\npreventive services to underserved pop-\nulations\nin\nrural and\nhard-to-reach\ncommunities. Even though CHWs\u2019 core\ncompetencies are not clinical in nature,\nin some circumstances, clinicians may\ndelegate limited clinical tasks to CHWs.\nIf such is the case, these tasks must al-\nways be performed under the direction\nand supervision of the delegating health\nprofessional and following state health\ncare laws and statutes (122,123).\nReferences\n1.

Members of the ADA Professional\nPractice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for up-\ndating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted.

Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune b-cell destruction, usually leading to ab-\nsolute insulin de\ufb01ciency, including latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood)\n2. Type 2 diabetes (due to a non-autoimmune progressive loss of adequate\nb-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance and\nmetabolic syndrome)\n3. Speci\ufb01c types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syn-\ndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young),\ndiseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic \ufb01brosis and pancreatitis), and\ndrug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treat-\nment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\n4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third tri-\nmester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation)\nThis section reviews most common forms of diabetes but is not comprehensive. For\nadditional information, see the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position state-\nment \u201cDiagnosis and Classi\ufb01cation of Diabetes Mellitus\u201d (1).\nType 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical\npresentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classi\ufb01cation is impor-\ntant for determining therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classi\ufb01ed as\nhaving type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms\nof type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes only in children are\nno longer accurate, as both diseases occur in both age groups.

The onset of\ntype 1 diabetes may be more variable\nin adults; they may not present with\nthe classic symptoms seen in children\nand may experience temporary remis-\nsion from the need for insulin (5\u20137). The\nfeatures most useful in discrimination of\ntype 1 diabetes include younger age at\ndiagnosis (<35 years) with lower BMI\n(<25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss,\nketoacidosis, and glucose >360 mg/dL\n(20 mmol/L) at presentation (8). Occa-\nsionally, people with type 2 diabetes\nmay present with DKA (9,10), particularly\nmembers of ethnic and racial minorities\n(11). It is important for the health care\nprofessional to realize that classi\ufb01cation\nof diabetes type is not always straight-\nforward at presentation and that mis-\ndiagnosis is common (e.g., adults with\ntype 1 diabetes misdiagnosed as having\ntype 2 diabetes, individuals with maturity-\nonset diabetes of the young [MODY]\nmisdiagnosed as having type 1 diabe-\ntes). Although dif\ufb01culties in distinguish-\ning diabetes type may occur in all age\ngroups at onset, the diagnosis becomes\nmore obvious over time in people with\nb-cell de\ufb01ciency as the degree of b-cell\nde\ufb01ciency becomes clear.\nIn both type 1 and type 2 diabetes,\nvarious genetic and environmental factors\ncan result in the progressive loss of b-cell\nmass and/or function that manifests clini-\ncally as hyperglycemia. Once hypergly-\ncemia occurs, people with all forms of\ndiabetes are at risk for developing the\nsame chronic complications, although rates\nof progression may differ. The identi\ufb01cation\nof individualized therapies for diabetes\nin the future will be informed by better\ncharacterization of the many paths to\nb-cell demise or dysfunction (12). Across\nthe globe, many groups are working on\ncombining clinical, pathophysiological,\nand genetic characteristics to more pre-\ncisely de\ufb01ne the subsets of diabetes that\nare currently clustered into the type 1\ndiabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomen-\nclature with the goal of optimizing per-\nsonalized treatment approaches. Many\nof these studies show great promise\nand may soon be incorporated into the\ndiabetes classi\ufb01cation system (13).\nCharacterization of the underlying path-\nophysiology is more precisely developed\nin type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabe-\ntes. It is now clear from prospective stud-\nies that the persistent presence of two or\nmore islet autoantibodies is a near-certain\npredictor of clinical diabetes (14). The rate\nof progression is dependent on the age\nat \ufb01rst detection of autoantibody, number\nof autoantibodies, autoantibody speci\ufb01c-\nity, and autoantibody titer. Glucose and\nA1C levels rise well before the clinical\nonset of diabetes, making diagnosis feasi-\nble well before the onset of DKA. Three\ndistinct stages of type 1 diabetes can\nbe identi\ufb01ed (Table 2.1) and serve as\na framework for research and regula-\ntory decision-making (12,15). There is\ndebate as to whether slowly progressive\nautoimmune diabetes with an adult on-\nset should be termed latent autoimmune\ndiabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1 dia-\nbetes. The clinical priority with detection\nof LADA is awareness that slow auto-\nimmune b-cell destruction can occur in\nadults leading to a long duration of mar-\nginal insulin secretory capacity. For the\npurpose of this classi\ufb01cation, all forms\nof diabetes mediated by autoimmune\nb-cell destruction are included under\nthe rubric of type 1 diabetes. Use of the\nterm LADA is common and acceptable\nin clinical practice and has the practical\nimpact of heightening awareness of\na population of adults likely to have\nprogressive autoimmune b-cell destruc-\ntion (16), thus accelerating insulin initiation\nprior to deterioration of glucose manage-\nment or development of DKA (6,17).\nThe paths to b-cell demise and dys-\nfunction are less well de\ufb01ned in type 2\ndiabetes, but de\ufb01cient b-cell insulin se-\ncretion, frequently in the setting of insulin\nresistance, appears to be the common de-\nnominator. Type 2 diabetes is associated\nwith insulin secretory defects related to\ngenetics, in\ufb02ammation, and metabolic\nstress. Future classi\ufb01cation schemes for\ndiabetes will likely focus on the patho-\nphysiology of the underlying b-cell dys-\nfunction (12,13,18\u201320).\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES\nDiabetes may be diagnosed based on\nplasma glucose criteria, either the fast-\ning plasma glucose (FPG) value or the\n2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) value during\na 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\nor A1C criteria (21) (Table 2.2).\nGenerally, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g\nOGTT, and A1C are equally appropriate\nfor diagnostic screening. It should be\nnoted that detection rates of different\nscreening tests vary in both populations\nand individuals. Moreover, the ef\ufb01cacy\nof interventions for primary preven-\ntion of type 2 diabetes has mainly been\ndemonstrated among individuals who\nhave impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)\nwith or without elevated fasting glucose,\nnot for individuals with isolated im-\npaired fasting glucose (IFG) or for those\nwith prediabetes de\ufb01ned by A1C criteria\n(22,23).\nThe same tests may be used to screen\nfor and diagnose diabetes and to detect\nindividuals with prediabetes (Table 2.2 and\nTable 2.5) (24).

These\nstandards include speci\ufb01ed personnel re-\nquirements (including documented annual\ncompetency assessments) and participa-\ntion three times per year in an approved\npro\ufb01ciency testing program (29\u201332). As\ndiscussed in Section 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d\npoint-of-care A1C assays may be more\ngenerally applied for assessment of glyce-\nmic stability in the clinic.\nA1C has several advantages compared\nwith FPG and OGTT, including greater\nconvenience (fasting not required), greater\npreanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day\nperturbations during stress, changes in\nnutrition, or illness. However, these ad-\nvantages may be offset by the lower\nsensitivity of A1C at the designated cut\npoint, greater cost, limited availability of\nA1C testing in certain regions of the de-\nveloping world, and the imperfect cor-\nrelation\nbetween\nA1C\nand\naverage\nglucose in certain individuals. The A1C\ntest, with a diagnostic threshold of $6.5%\n(48 mmol/mol), diagnoses only 30% of the\ndiabetes cases identi\ufb01ed collectively using\nA1C, FPG, or 2-h PG, according to National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) data (33). Despite these limi-\ntations with A1C, in 2009, the Interna-\ntional Expert Committee added A1C to\nthe diagnostic criteria with the goal of in-\ncreased screening (21).\nWhen using A1C to diagnose diabetes,\nit is important to recognize that A1C is\nan indirect measure of average blood\nglucose levels and to take other factors\ninto consideration that may impact he-\nmoglobin glycation independently of gly-\ncemia, such as hemodialysis, pregnancy,\nHIV treatment (34,35), age, race/ethnicity,\ngenetic\nbackground,\nand\nanemia/\nhemoglobinopathies.

However, recent ADA\nclinical guidance concluded that A1C,\nFPG, or 2-h PG could be used to test\nfor prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in\nchildren and adolescents (see SCREENING\nAND TESTING FOR PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES\nIN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS below for addi-\ntional information) (36).\nRace/Ethnicity/Hemoglobinopathies\nHemoglobin variants can interfere with\nthe measurement of A1C, although most\nassays in use in the U.S. are unaffected\nby the most common variants. Marked\ndiscrepancies between measured A1C\nand plasma glucose levels should prompt\nconsideration that the A1C assay may\nnot be reliable for that individual. For\nindividuals with a hemoglobin variant but\nnormal red blood cell turnover, such as\nthose with the sickle cell trait, an A1C as-\nsay without interference from hemoglo-\nbin variants should be used. An updated\nlist of A1C assays with interferences is\navailable at ngsp.org/interf.asp.\nAfrican American individuals heterozy-\ngous for the common hemoglobin vari-\nant HbS may have, for any given level of\nmean glycemia, lower A1C by about\n0.3% compared with those without the\ntrait (37). Another genetic variant, X-linked\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\nG202A, carried by 11% of African Amer-\nican individuals, was associated with a\ndecrease in A1C of about 0.8% in homo-\nzygous men and 0.7% in homozygous\nwomen compared with those without\nthe variant (38). For example, in Tanza-\nnia, where there is a high likelihood of\nhemoglobinopathies in people with HIV,\nA1C may be lower than expected based\non glucose, limiting its usefulness for\nscreening (39).\nEven in the absence of hemoglobin\nvariants, A1C levels may vary with race/\nethnicity independently of glycemia (40\u201342).\nFor example, African American individu-\nals may have higher A1C levels than\nnon-Hispanic White individuals with simi-\nlar fasting and post\u2013glucose load glucose\nlevels (43). Though con\ufb02icting data exist,\nAfrican American individuals may also\nhave higher levels of fructosamine and\nglycated albumin and lower levels of\n1,5-anhydroglucitol, suggesting that their\nglycemic burden (particularly postprandi-\nally) may be higher (44,45). Similarly,\nA1C levels may be higher for a given\nmean glucose concentration when\nmeasured with continuous glucose\nmonitoring (46). A recent report in\nAfro-Caribbean people demonstrated a\nlower A1C than predicted by glucose lev-\nels (47). Despite these and other reported\ndifferences, the association of A1C with\nrisk for complications appears to be\nsimilar in African American and non-\nHispanic White populations (42,48).\nIn the Taiwanese population, age and\nsex have been reported to be associ-\nated with increased A1C in men (49);\nthe clinical implications of this \ufb01nding\nare unclear at this time.\nOther Conditions Altering the Relationship\nof A1C and Glycemia\nIn conditions associated with increased\nred blood cell turnover, such as sickle\ncell disease, pregnancy (second and third\ntrimesters), glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase de\ufb01ciency (50,51), hemodialysis,\nrecent blood loss or transfusion, or\nerythropoietin therapy, only plasma blood\nglucose criteria should be used to diag-\nnose diabetes (52). A1C is less reliable\nthan blood glucose measurement in other\nconditions such as the postpartum state\n(53\u201355), HIV treated with certain protease\ninhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (34), and\niron-de\ufb01cient anemia (56).\nConfirming the Diagnosis\nUnless there is a clear clinical diagnosis\n(e.g., patient in a hyperglycemic crisis or\nwith classic symptoms of hyperglycemia\nand a random plasma glucose $200 mg/dL\n[11.1 mmol/L]), diagnosis requires two\nabnormal screening test results, either\nfrom the same sample (57) or in two\nseparate test samples. If using two sepa-\nrate test samples, it is recommended that\nthe second test, which may either be a\nrepeat of the initial test or a different\ntest, be performed without delay. For\nexample, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol)\nand a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol),\nthe diagnosis of diabetes is con\ufb01rmed. If\ntwo different tests (such as A1C and FPG)\nare both above the diagnostic threshold\nwhen analyzed from the same sample or\nin two different test samples, this also\ncon\ufb01rms the diagnosis. On the other\nhand, if a patient has discordant results\nfrom two different tests, then the test\nresult that is above the diagnostic cut\npoint should be repeated, with careful\nconsideration of the possibility of A1C\nassay interference. The diagnosis is made\non the basis of the con\ufb01rmatory screen-\ning test. For example, if a patient meets\nthe diabetes criterion of the A1C (two\nresults $6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) but not\nFPG (<126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]), that\nperson should nevertheless be consid-\nered to have diabetes.\nEach of the screening tests has prea-\nnalytic and analytic variability, so it is\npossible that a test yielding an abnor-\nmal result (i.e., above the diagnostic\nthreshold), when repeated, will produce\na value below the diagnostic cut point.\nThis scenario is likely for FPG and 2-h PG\nif the glucose samples remain at room\ntemperature and are not centrifuged\npromptly. Because of the potential for\npreanalytic variability, it is critical that\nsamples for plasma glucose be spun and\nseparated immediately after they are\ndrawn. If patients have test results near\nthe margins of the diagnostic threshold,\nthe health care professional should dis-\ncuss signs and symptoms with the pa-\ntient and repeat the test in 3\u20136 months.\nPeople should consume a mixed diet\nwith at least 150 g of carbohydrates on\nthe 3 days prior to oral glucose tolerance\ntesting (58\u201360). Fasting and carbohydrate\nrestriction can falsely elevate glucose level\nwith an oral glucose challenge.\nDiagnosis\nIn a patient with classic symptoms, mea-\nsurement of plasma glucose is suf\ufb01cient\nto diagnose diabetes (symptoms of hy-\nperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis plus\na random plasma glucose $200 mg/dL\n[11.1 mmol/L]). In these cases, knowing\nthe plasma glucose level is critical because,\nin addition to con\ufb01rming that symptoms\nare due to diabetes, it will inform manage-\nment decisions. Some health care profes-\nsionals may also want to know the A1C to\ndetermine the chronicity of the hyper-\nglycemia.

B\nImmune-Mediated Diabetes\nThis\nform,\npreviously called\n\u201cinsulin-\ndependent diabetes\u201d or \u201cjuvenile-onset\ndiabetes,\u201d accounts for 5\u201310% of diabetes\nand is due to cell-mediated autoimmune\ndestruction of the pancreatic b-cells. Au-\ntoimmune markers include islet cell auto-\nantibodies and autoantibodies to GAD\n(glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD65),\ninsulin, the tyrosine phosphatases islet\nantigen 2 (IA-2) and IA-2b, and zinc trans-\nporter 8. Numerous clinical studies are\nbeing conducted to test various methods\nof preventing type 1 diabetes in those\nwith\nevidence\nof\nislet\nautoimmunity\n(trialnet.org/our-research/prevention-\nstudies) (14,17,61\u201364). Stage 1 of\ntype 1 diabetes is de\ufb01ned by the\npresence of two or more of these au-\ntoimmune markers. The disease has\nstrong HLA associations, with linkage\nto the DQB1 and DRB1 haplotypes, and\ngenetic screening has been used in some\nresearch studies to identify high-risk\npopulations. Speci\ufb01c alleles in these genes\ncan be either predisposing or protective\n(Table 2.1).\nThe rate of b-cell destruction is quite\nvariable, being rapid in some individuals\n(particularly but not exclusively in infants\nand children) and slow in others (mainly\nbut not exclusively adults) (65,66). Chil-\ndren and adolescents often present with\nDKA as the \ufb01rst manifestation of the\ndisease, and the rates in the U.S. have\nincreased dramatically over the past\n20 years (2\u20134). Others have modest\nfasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly\nchange to severe hyperglycemia and/\nor DKA with infection or other stress.\nAdults may retain suf\ufb01cient b-cell func-\ntion to prevent DKA for many years;\nsuch individuals may have remission\nor decreased insulin needs for months\nor\nyears\nand\neventually\nbecome\ndependent on insulin for survival and are\nat risk for DKA (5\u20137,67,68). At this\nlater stage of the disease, there is lit-\ntle or no insulin secretion, as manifested\nby low or undetectable levels of plasma C-\npeptide. Immune-mediated diabetes is\nthe most common form of diabetes in\nchildhood and adolescence, but it can\noccur at any age, even in the 8th and\n9th decades of life.\nAutoimmune destruction of b-cells has\nmultiple genetic factors and is also re-\nlated to environmental factors that are\nstill poorly de\ufb01ned. Although individuals\ndo not typically have obesity when they\npresent with type 1 diabetes, obesity is\nincreasingly common in the general pop-\nulation; as such, obesity should not pre-\nclude testing for type 1 diabetes. People\nwith type 1 diabetes are also prone to\nother autoimmune disorders such as\nHashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, ce-\nliac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo,\nautoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gra-\nvis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4,\n\u201cComprehensive Medical Evaluation and\nAssessment of Comorbidities\u201d). Type 1\ndiabetes can be associated with mono-\ngenic polyglandular autoimmune syn-\ndromes, including immune dysregulation,\npolyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and\nX-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is an\nearly-onset systemic autoimmune, ge-\nnetic disorder caused by mutation of\nthe forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)\ngene, and another caused by the auto-\nimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutation\n(69,70). As indicated by the names,\nthese disorders are associated with\nother autoimmune and rheumatological\ndiseases.\nIntroduction of immunotherapy, spe-\nci\ufb01cally checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer\ntreatment has led to unexpected ad-\nverse events, including immune system\nactivation precipitating autoimmune dis-\nease. Fulminant onset of type 1 diabe-\ntes can develop, with DKA and low or\nundetectable levels of C-peptide as a\nmarker of endogenous b-cell function\n(71,72). Fewer than half of these pa-\ntients have autoantibodies that are seen\nin type 1 diabetes, supporting alternate\npathobiology. This immune-related adverse\nevent occurs in just under 1% of check-\npoint inhibitor-treated patients but most\ncommonly occurs with agents that block\nthe programmed cell death protein 1/\nprogrammed cell death ligand 1 pathway\nalone or in combination with other\ncheckpoint inhibitors (73). To date, the\nmajority of immune checkpoint inhibitor\u2013\nrelated cases of type 1 diabetes occur in\npeople with high-risk HLA-DR4 (present in\n76% of patients), whereas other high-risk\nHLA alleles are not more common than\nthose in the general population (73). To\ndate, risk cannot be predicted by family\nhistory or autoantibodies, so all health care\nprofessionals administering these medica-\ntions should be mindful of this adverse ef-\nfect and educate patients appropriately.\nIdiopathic Type 1 Diabetes\nSome forms of type 1 diabetes have no\nknown etiologies. These individuals have\npermanent insulinopenia and are prone\nto DKA but have no evidence of b-cell\nautoimmunity. However, only a minority\nof people with type 1 diabetes fall into this\ncategory. Individuals with autoantibody-\nnegative type 1 diabetes of African or\nAsian ancestry may suffer from episodic\nDKA and exhibit varying degrees of insu-\nlin de\ufb01ciency between episodes (possibly\nketosis-prone diabetes) (74). This form of\ndiabetes is strongly inherited and is not\nHLA associated. An absolute requirement\nfor insulin replacement therapy in affected\nindividuals may be intermittent. Future\nresearch is needed to determine the\ncause of b-cell destruction in this rare\nclinical scenario.\nScreening for Type 1 Diabetes Risk\nThe incidence and prevalence of type 1\ndiabetes are increasing (75). People with\ntype 1 diabetes often present with acute\nsymptoms of diabetes and markedly ele-\nvated blood glucose levels, and 40\u201360%\nare diagnosed with life-threatening DKA\n(2\u20134). Multiple studies indicate that mea-\nsuring islet autoantibodies in relatives of\nthose with type 1 diabetes (15) or in chil-\ndren from the general population (76,77)\ncan effectively identify those who will de-\nvelop type 1 diabetes. A study reported\nthe risk of progression to type 1 diabetes\nfrom the time of seroconversion to auto-\nantibody positivity in three pediatric co-\nhorts from Finland, Germany, and the U.S.\nOf the 585 children who developed more\nthan two autoantibodies, nearly 70% de-\nveloped type 1 diabetes within 10 years\nand 84% within 15 years (14).

Such testing, coupled with edu-\ncation about diabetes symptoms and close\nfollow-up, has been shown to enable ear-\nlier diagnosis and prevent DKA (81,82).\nWhile widespread clinical screening\nof asymptomatic low-risk individuals is\nnot currently recommended due to lack\nof approved therapeutic interventions,\nseveral innovative research screening pro-\ngrams are available in Europe (e.g., Fr1da,\ngppad.org) and the U.S. (trialnet.org,\naskhealth.org). Participation should be\nencouraged to accelerate development\nof evidence-based clinical guidelines for\nthe general population and relatives of\nthose with type 1 diabetes. Individuals\nwho test positive should be counseled\nabout the risk of developing diabetes,\ndiabetes symptoms, and DKA preven-\ntion. Numerous clinical studies are be-\ning conducted to test various methods\nof preventing and treating stage 2 type 1\ndiabetes in those with evidence of auto-\nimmunity with promising results (see\nclinicaltrials.gov and trialnet.org). Delay\nof overt diabetes development in stage 2\ntype 1 diabetes with the anti-CD3 anti-\nbody teplizumab in relatives at risk for\ntype 1 diabetes was reported in 2019,\nwith an extension of the randomized\ncontrolled trial in 2021 (83,84). Based on\nthese data, this agent has been submit-\nted to the FDA for the indication of delay\nor prevention of clinical type 1 diabetes\nin at-risk individuals. Neither this agent\nnor others in this category are currently\navailable for clinical use.\nPREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES\nRecommendations\n2.7\nScreening for prediabetes and\ntype 2 diabetes with an infor-\nmal assessment of risk factors\nor validated risk calculator\nshould be done in asymptom-\natic adults.

    "text": "(Table 2.5). Prediabetes should not be\nviewed as a clinical entity in its own right\nbut rather as a risk factor for progression\nto diabetes and cardiovascular disease\n(CVD). Criteria for screening for diabetes\nor prediabetes in asymptomatic adults\nare outlined in Table 2.3. Prediabetes is\nassociated with obesity (especially ab-\ndominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia\nwith high triglycerides and/or low HDL\ncholesterol, and hypertension. The pres-\nence of prediabetes should prompt com-\nprehensive screening for cardiovascular\nrisk factors.\nDiagnosis\nIFG is de\ufb01ned as FPG levels from 100 to\n125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)\n(82,83) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during\n75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from\n7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (25). It should be\nnoted that the World Health Organiza-\ntion and numerous other diabetes organ-\nizations de\ufb01ne the IFG lower limit at\n110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).\nAs with the glucose measures, several\nprospective studies that used A1C to\npredict the progression to diabetes as\nde\ufb01ned by A1C criteria demonstrated a\nstrong, continuous association between\nA1C and subsequent diabetes. In a sys-\ntematic review of 44,203 individuals from\n16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval\naveraging 5.6 years (range 2.8\u201312 years),\nthose with A1C between 5.5% and 6.0%\n(between 37 and 42 mmol/mol) had a\nsubstantially increased risk of diabetes\n(5-year incidence from 9% to 25%). Those\nwith an A1C range of 6.0\u20136.5% (42\u201348\nmmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of develop-\ning diabetes between 25% and 50% and\na relative risk 20 times higher compared\nwith A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (86). In a\ncommunity-based study of African American\nand non-Hispanic White adults without\ndiabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger\npredictor of subsequent diabetes and car-\ndiovascular events than fasting glucose\n(87). Other analyses suggest that A1C of\n5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associ-\nated with a diabetes risk similar to that of\nthe high-risk participants in the Diabetes\nPrevention Program (DPP) (88), and A1C\nat baseline was a strong predictor of the\ndevelopment of glucose-de\ufb01ned diabetes\nduring the DPP and its follow-up (89).\nHence, it is reasonable to consider an\nA1C range of 5.7\u20136.4% (39\u201347 mmol/mol)\nas identifying individuals with prediabe-\ntes. Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT,\nindividuals with A1C of 5.7\u20136.4% (39\u2013\n47 mmol/mol) should be informed of\ntheir increased risk for diabetes and CVD\nand counseled about effective strategies\nto lower their risks (see Section 3,\n\u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes\nand Associated Comorbidities\u201d). Similar\nto glucose measurements, the continuum\nof risk is curvilinear, so as A1C rises, the\ndiabetes risk rises disproportionately (86).\nAggressive interventions and vigilant\nfollow-up should be pursued for those\nconsidered at very high risk (e.g., those\nwith A1C >6.0% [42 mmol/mol]).\nTable 2.5 summarizes the categories\nof prediabetes, and Table 2.3 outlines\nthe criteria for screening for prediabe-\ntes. The ADA Diabetes Risk Test is an\nadditional option for assessment to\ndetermine the appropriateness of screen-\ning for diabetes or prediabetes in asymp-\ntomatic adults (Fig. 2.1) (diabetes.org/\nsocrisktest).

    "text": "undiagnosed for many years because\nhyperglycemia develops gradually and,\nat earlier stages, is often not severe\nenough for the patient to notice the\nclassic diabetes symptoms caused by hy-\nperglycemia, such as dehydration or un-\nintentional weight loss. Nevertheless,\neven undiagnosed people with diabetes\nare at increased risk of developing macro-\nvascular and microvascular complications.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes may have\ninsulin levels that appear normal or ele-\nvated, yet the failure to normalize blood\nglucose re\ufb02ects a relative defect in glu-\ncose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus,\ninsulin secretion is defective in these\nindividuals and insuf\ufb01cient to compensate\nfor insulin resistance. Insulin resistance\nmay improve with weight reduction,\nphysical activity, and/or pharmacologic\ntreatment of hyperglycemia but is sel-\ndom restored to normal. Recent inter-\nventions with intensive diet and exercise\nor surgical weight loss have led to diabe-\ntes remission (92\u201398) (see Section 8,\n\u201cObesity and Weight Management for\nthe Prevention and Treatment of Type 2\nDiabetes\u201d).\nThe risk of developing type 2 diabetes\nincreases with age, obesity, and lack of\nphysical activity (99,100). It occurs more\nfrequently in individuals with prior gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus (GDM) or poly-\ncystic ovary syndrome. It is also more\ncommon in people with hypertension or\ndyslipidemia and in certain racial/ethnic\nsubgroups (African American, Native\nAmerican, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian\nAmerican). It is often associated with\na strong genetic predisposition or family\nhistory in \ufb01rst-degree relatives (more so\nthan type 1 diabetes). However, the ge-\nnetics of type 2 diabetes are poorly un-\nderstood and under intense investigation\nin this era of precision medicine (18). In\nadults without traditional risk factors for\ntype 2 diabetes and/or of younger age,\nconsider islet autoantibody testing (e.g.,\nGAD65 autoantibodies) to exclude the\ndiagnosis of type 1 diabetes (8).\nScreening and Testing for Prediabetes\nand Type 2 Diabetes in Asymptomatic\nAdults\nScreening for prediabetes and type 2 di-\nabetes risk through an informal assess-\nment of risk factors (Table 2.3) or with\nan assessment tool, such as the ADA\nrisk test (Fig. 2.1) (online at diabetes.\norg/socrisktest), is recommended to\nguide health care professionals on\nwhether performing a diagnostic test\n(Table 2.2) is appropriate. Prediabetes\nand type 2 diabetes meet criteria for\nconditions in which early detection via\nscreening is appropriate. Both conditions\nare common and impose signi\ufb01cant clin-\nical and public health burdens. There is\noften a long presymptomatic phase be-\nfore the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.\nSimple tests to detect preclinical disease\nare readily available (101). The duration\nof glycemic burden is a strong predictor\nof adverse outcomes. There are effective\ninterventions that prevent progression\nfrom prediabetes to diabetes. It is im-\nportant to individualize risk/bene\ufb01t of\nformal intervention for people with pre-\ndiabetes and consider patient-centered\ngoals. Risk models have explored the\nbene\ufb01t, in general \ufb01nding higher ben-\ne\ufb01t of intervention in those at highest\nrisk (102) (see Section 3, \u201cPrevention or\nDelay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated\nComorbidities\u201d) and reduce the risk\nof diabetes complications (103) (see\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d Section 11, \u201cChronic\nKidney Disease and Risk Management,\u201d\nand Section 12, \u201cRetinopathy, Neuropathy,\nand Foot Care\u201d). In the most recent Na-\ntional Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetes\nPrevention Program Outcomes Study\n(DPPOS) report, prevention of progres-\nsion from prediabetes to diabetes (104)\nresulted in lower rates of developing ret-\ninopathy and nephropathy (105). Similar\nimpact on diabetes complications was\nreported with screening, diagnosis, and\ncomprehensive risk factor management\nin the U.K. Clinical Practice Research\nDatalink database (103). In that report,\nprogression from prediabetes to diabetes\naugmented risk of complications.\nApproximately one-quarter of people\nwith diabetes in the U.S. and nearly half\nof Asian and Hispanic American people\nwith diabetes are undiagnosed (106,107).\nAlthough screening of asymptomatic indi-\nviduals to identify those with prediabetes\nor diabetes might seem reasonable, rigor-\nous clinical trials to prove the effective-\nness of such screening have not been\nconducted and are unlikely to occur.\nClinical conditions, such as hyperten-\nsion, hypertensive pregnancy, and obe-\nsity, enhance risk (108). Based on a\npopulation estimate, diabetes in people\nof childbearing age is underdiagnosed\n(109). Employing a probabilistic model,\nPeterson et al. (110) demonstrated cost\nand health bene\ufb01ts of preconception\nscreening.\nA large European randomized con-\ntrolled trial compared the impact of\nscreening for diabetes and intensive\nmultifactorial intervention with that of\nscreening and routine care (111). Gen-\neral practice patients between the ages\nof 40 and 69 years were screened for\ndiabetes and randomly assigned by prac-\ntice to intensive treatment of multiple\nrisk factors or routine diabetes care.\nAfter 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk\nfactors were modestly but signi\ufb01cantly\nimproved with intensive treatment com-\npared with routine care, but the inci-\ndence of \ufb01rst CVD events or mortality\nwas not signi\ufb01cantly different between\nthe groups (26). The excellent care pro-\nvided to patients in the routine care\ngroup and the lack of an unscreened\ncontrol arm limited the authors\u2019 ability\nto determine whether screening and\nearly treatment improved outcomes com-\npared with no screening and later treat-\nment after clinical diagnoses. Computer\nsimulation modeling studies suggest that\nmajor bene\ufb01ts are likely to accrue from\nthe early diagnosis and treatment of\nhyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk\nfactors in type 2 diabetes (112); more-\nover, screening, beginning at age 30 or\n45 years and independent of risk factors,\nmay be cost-effective (<$11,000 per\nquality-adjusted life year gained\u20142010\nmodeling data) (113). Cost-effectiveness\nof screening has been reinforced in co-\nhort studies (114,115).\nAdditional considerations regarding\ntesting for type 2 diabetes and predia-\nbetes in asymptomatic individuals in-\nclude the following.\nAge\nAge is a major risk factor for diabetes.\nTesting should begin at no later than age\n35 years for all people (116). Screening\nshould be considered in adults of any\nage with overweight or obesity and one\nor more risk factors for diabetes.\nBMI and Ethnicity\nIn general, BMI $25 kg/m2 is a risk fac-\ntor for diabetes. However, data suggest\nthat the BMI cut point should be lower\nfor the Asian American population\n(117,118).

For example, in a large multiethnic\ncohort study, for an equivalent incidence\nrate of diabetes, a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in\nnon-Hispanic White individuals was equiv-\nalent to a BMI of 26 kg/m2 in African\nAmerican individuals (121).\nMedications\nCertain medications, such as glucocorti-\ncoids, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medi-\ncations (34), and atypical antipsychotics\n(92), are known to increase the risk of\ndiabetes and should be considered when\ndeciding whether to screen.\nHIV\nIndividuals with HIV are at higher risk\nfor developing prediabetes and diabetes\non antiretroviral (ARV) therapies; a\nscreening protocol is therefore recom-\nmended (122). The A1C test may underes-\ntimate glycemia in people with HIV; it is\nnot recommended for diagnosis and may\npresent challenges for monitoring (35). In\nthose with prediabetes, weight loss through\nhealthy nutrition and physical activity may\nreduce the progression toward diabe-\ntes. Among people with HIV and dia-\nbetes, preventive health care using an\napproach used in people without HIV\nis critical to reduce the risks of micro-\nvascular and macrovascular complica-\ntions. Diabetes risk is increased with\ncertain PIs and NRTIs. New-onset diabe-\ntes is estimated to occur in more than\n5% of individuals infected with HIV on\nPIs, whereas more than 15% may have\nprediabetes (123).\nPIs are associated with insulin resis-\ntance and may also lead to apoptosis of\npancreatic b-cells. NRTIs also affect fat\ndistribution (both lipohypertrophy and\nlipoatrophy), which is associated with\ninsulin resistance. For people with HIV\nand ARV-associated hyperglycemia, it may\nbe appropriate to consider discontinuing\nthe problematic ARV agents if safe and\neffective alternatives are available (124).\nBefore making ARV substitutions, care-\nfully consider the possible effect on\nHIV virological control and the poten-\ntial adverse effects of new ARV agents.\nIn some cases, antihyperglycemic agents\nmay still be necessary.\nTesting Interval\nThe appropriate interval between screen-\ning tests is not known (125). The rationale\nfor the 3-year interval is that with this in-\nterval, the number of false-positive tests\nthat require con\ufb01rmatory testing will\nbe reduced, and individuals with false-\nnegative tests will be retested before\nsubstantial time elapses and complica-\ntions develop (125). In especially high-\nrisk individuals, particularly with weight\ngain, shorter intervals between screen-\ning may be useful.\nCommunity Screening\nIdeally, screening should be carried out\nwithin a health care setting because of\nthe need for follow-up and treatment.\nCommunity screening outside a health\ncare setting is generally not recommended\nbecause people with positive tests may\nnot seek, or have access to, appropriate\nfollow-up testing and care. However, in\nspeci\ufb01c situations where an adequate re-\nferral system is established beforehand\nfor positive tests, community screening\nmay be considered. Community screen-\ning may also be poorly targeted; i.e., it\nmay fail to reach the groups most at risk\nand inappropriately test those at very\nlow risk or even those who have already\nbeen diagnosed (126).\nScreening in Dental Practices\nBecause periodontal disease is associ-\nated with diabetes, the utility of screen-\ning in a dental setting and referral to\nprimary care as a means to improve the\ndiagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes\nhas been explored (127\u2013129), with one\nstudy estimating that 30% of patients\n$30 years of age seen in general dental\npractices had dysglycemia (129,130). A\nsimilar study in 1,150 dental patients\n>40 years old in India reported 20.69%\nand 14.60% meeting criteria for pre-\ndiabetes and diabetes, respectively,\nusing random blood glucose. Further\nresearch is needed to demonstrate\nthe feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-\neffectiveness of screening in this setting.\nScreening and Testing for Prediabetes\nand Type 2 Diabetes in Children and\nAdolescents\nIn the last decade, the incidence and\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes in chil-\ndren and adolescents has increased dra-\nmatically, especially in racial and ethnic\nminority populations (75). See Table 2.4\nfor recommendations on risk-based\nscreening for type 2 diabetes or pre-\ndiabetes in asymptomatic children and\nadolescents in a clinical setting (36). See\nTable 2.2 and Table 2.5 for the criteria\nfor the diagnosis of diabetes and pre-\ndiabetes, respectively, that apply to\nchildren, adolescents, and adults. See\nSection 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d\nfor additional information on type 2 dia-\nbetes in children and adolescents.\nSome studies question the validity of\nA1C in the pediatric population, espe-\ncially among certain ethnicities, and\nsuggest OGTT or FPG as more suitable\ndiagnostic tests (131). However, many\nof these studies do not recognize that\ndiabetes diagnostic criteria are based\non long-term health outcomes, and vali-\ndations are not currently available in\nthe pediatric population (132). The ADA\nacknowledges the limited data support-\ning A1C for diagnosing type 2 diabetes\nin children and adolescents. Although\nA1C is not recommended for diagnosis\nof diabetes in children with cystic \ufb01bro-\nsis or symptoms suggestive of acute on-\nset of type 1 diabetes, and only A1C\nassays without interference are appro-\npriate for children with hemoglobinopa-\nthies, the ADA continues to recommend\nA1C and the criteria in Table 2.2 for di-\nagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this cohort\nto decrease barriers to screening (133,134).\nCYSTIC FIBROSIS\u2013RELATED\nDIABETES\nRecommendations\n2.16\nAnnual screening for cystic\n\ufb01brosis\u2013related diabetes with\nan oral glucose tolerance test\nshould begin by age 10 years in\nall people with cystic \ufb01brosis\nS28\nClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

B\n2.18\nPeople with cystic \ufb01brosis\u2013\nrelated diabetes should be\ntreated with insulin to attain in-\ndividualized glycemic goals. A\n2.19\nBeginning 5 years after the\ndiagnosis of cystic \ufb01brosis\u2013\nrelated diabetes, annual mon-\nitoring for complications of di-\nabetes is recommended. E\nCystic \ufb01brosis\u2013related diabetes (CFRD) is\nthe most common comorbidity in people\nwith cystic \ufb01brosis, occurring in about\n20% of adolescents and 40\u201350% of adults\n(135). Diabetes in this population, com-\npared with individuals with type 1 or\ntype 2 diabetes, is associated with worse\nnutritional status, more severe in\ufb02amma-\ntory lung disease, and greater mortality. In-\nsulin insuf\ufb01ciency is the primary defect in\nCFRD. Genetically determined b-cell func-\ntion and insulin resistance associated with\ninfection and in\ufb02ammation may also\ncontribute to the development of CFRD.\nMilder abnormalities of glucose toler-\nance are even more common and occur\nat earlier ages than CFRD. Whether indi-\nviduals with IGT should be treated with\ninsulin replacement has not currently\nbeen determined. Although screening\nfor diabetes before the age of 10 years\ncan identify risk for progression to CFRD\nin those with abnormal glucose toler-\nance, no bene\ufb01t has been established\nwith respect to weight, height, BMI, or\nlung function. OGTT is the recommended\nscreening test; however, recent publica-\ntions suggest that an A1C cut point\nthreshold of 5.5% (5.8% in a second\nstudy) would detect more than 90% of\ncases and reduce patient screening bur-\nden (136,137). Ongoing studies are un-\nderway to validate this approach, and\nA1C is not recommended for screening\n(138). Regardless of age, weight loss or\nfailure of expected weight gain is a risk\nfor CFRD and should prompt screening\n(136,137). The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation\nPatient Registry (139) evaluated 3,553\npeople with cystic \ufb01brosis and diag-\nnosed 445 (13%) with CFRD. Early di-\nagnosis and treatment of CFRD was\nassociated with preservation of lung\nfunction. The European Cystic Fibrosis\nSociety Patient Registry reported an in-\ncrease in CFRD with age (increased 10%\nper decade), genotype, decreased lung\nfunction, and female sex (140,141). Con-\ntinuous glucose monitoring or HOMA of\nb-cell function (142) may be more sensi-\ntive than OGTT to detect risk for progres-\nsion to CFRD; however, evidence linking\nthese results to long-term outcomes is\nlacking, and these tests are not recom-\nmended for screening outside of the re-\nsearch setting (143).\nCFRD mortality has signi\ufb01cantly de-\ncreased over time, and the gap in mor-\ntality between people with cystic \ufb01brosis\nwith and without diabetes has consider-\nably narrowed (144). There are limited\nclinical trial data on therapy for CFRD.\nThe largest study compared three regi-\nmens: premeal insulin aspart, repagli-\nnide, or oral placebo in people with cystic\n\ufb01brosis and diabetes or abnormal glucose\ntolerance. Participants all had weight loss\nin the year preceding treatment; however,\nin the insulin-treated group, this pattern\nwas reversed, and participants gained 0.39\n(\u00b1 0.21) BMI units (P = 0.02). The repagli-\nnide-treated group had initial weight\ngain, but it was not sustained by 6\nmonths. The placebo group continued to\nlose weight (144). Insulin remains the\nmost widely used therapy for CFRD (145).\nThe primary rationale for the use of insu-\nlin in people with CFRD isto induce an ana-\nbolic state while promoting macronutrient\nretention and weight gain.\nAdditional resources for the clinical\nmanagement of CFRD can be found in\nthe position statement \u201cClinical Care\nGuidelines for Cystic Fibrosis\u2013Related\nDiabetes: A Position Statement of the\nAmerican Diabetes Association and a\nClinical Practice Guideline of the Cystic\nFibrosis Foundation, Endorsed by the\nPediatric Endocrine Society\u201d (146) and\nin the International Society for Pediatric\nand Adolescent Diabetes 2018 clinical\npractice consensus guidelines (135).\nPOSTTRANSPLANTATION\nDIABETES MELLITUS\nRecommendations\n2.20\nAfter organ transplantation,\nscreening for hyperglycemia\nshould be done. A formal di-\nagnosis of posttransplantation\ndiabetes mellitus is best made\nonce the individual is stable on\nan immunosuppressive regi-\nmen and in the absence of\nan acute infection. B\n2.21\nThe oral glucose tolerance test\nis the preferred test to make a\ndiagnosis of posttransplanta-\ntion diabetes mellitus. B\n2.22\nImmunosuppressive regimens\nshown to provide the best out-\ncomes for patient and graft\nsurvival should be used, irre-\nspective of posttransplantation\ndiabetes mellitus risk. E\nSeveral terms are used in the literature\nto describe the presence of diabetes\nfollowing organ transplantation (147).\n\u201cNew-onset diabetes after transplantation\u201d\n(NODAT) is one such designation that\ndescribes individuals who develop new-\nonset diabetes following transplant.\nNODAT excludes people with pretrans-\nplant diabetes that was undiagnosed as\nwell as posttransplant hyperglycemia\nthat resolves by the time of discharge\n(148). Another term, \u201cposttransplantation\ndiabetes mellitus\u201d (PTDM) (148,149), de-\nscribes the presence of diabetes in the\nposttransplant setting irrespective of the\ntiming of diabetes onset.\nHyperglycemia is very common dur-\ning the early posttransplant period, with\n\u000390% of kidney allograft recipients ex-\nhibiting hyperglycemia in the \ufb01rst few\nweeks following transplant (148\u2013151).\nIn most cases, such stress- or steroid-\ninduced hyperglycemia resolves by the\ntime of discharge (151,152). Although\nthe use of immunosuppressive thera-\npies is a major contributor to the devel-\nopment of PTDM, the risks of transplant\nrejection outweigh the risks of PTDM,\nand the role of the diabetes care health\ncare professional is to treat hyperglyce-\nmia appropriately regardless of the type\nof immunosuppression (148). Risk fac-\ntors for PTDM include both general dia-\nbetes risks (such as age, family history\nof diabetes, etc.) as well as transplant-\nspeci\ufb01c factors, such as use of immuno-\nsuppressant agents (153\u2013155). Whereas\nposttransplantation hyperglycemia is an\nimportant risk factor for subsequent\nPTDM, a formal diagnosis of PTDM is op-\ntimally made once the patient is stable\non maintenance mmunosuppression and\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes\nS29\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Risk factors for PTDM\nincluded elevated BMI, discharge from\nthe hospital on insulin, and glucose val-\nues in the 24 h prior to hospital dis-\ncharge (157). In an Iranian cohort, 19%\nhad PTDM after heart and lung trans-\nplant (158). The OGTT is considered\nthe gold-standard test for the diagnosis\nof PTDM (1 year posttransplant) (148,\n149,159,160). Pretransplant elevation\nin hs-CRP was associated with PTDM in\nthe setting of renal transplant (161,162).\nHowever, screening people with fasting\nglucose and/or A1C can identify high-\nrisk individuals requiring further assess-\nment and may reduce the number of\noverall OGTTs required.\nFew randomized controlled studies\nhave reported on the short- and long-\nterm use of antihyperglycemic agents\nin the setting of PTDM (153,163,164).\nMost studies have reported that trans-\nplant patients with hyperglycemia and\nPTDM after transplantation have higher\nrates of rejection, infection, and rehospi-\ntalization (151,153,165). Insulin therapy\nis the agent of choice for the manage-\nment of hyperglycemia, PTDM, and pre-\nexisting diabetes and diabetes in the\nhospital setting. After discharge, people\nwith preexisting diabetes could go back\non their pretransplant regimen if they\nwere in good control before transplanta-\ntion. Those with previously poor glycemic\nstability or with persistent hyperglycemia\nshould continue insulin with frequent\nhome glucose monitoring to determine\nwhen insulin dose reductions may be\nneeded and when it may be appropriate\nto switch to noninsulin agents.\nNo studies to date have established\nwhich noninsulin agents are safest or\nmost ef\ufb01cacious in PTDM. The choice of\nagent is usually made based on the side\neffect pro\ufb01le of the medication and\npossible interactions with the patient\u2019s\nimmunosuppression regimen (153). Drug\ndose adjustments may be required be-\ncause of decreases in the glomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate, a relatively common\ncomplication in transplant patients. A\nsmall short-term pilot study reported\nthat metformin was safe to use in re-\nnal transplant recipients (166), but its\nsafety has not been determined in\nother types of organ transplant. Thiazolidi-\nnediones have been used successfully in\npeople with liver and kidney transplants,\nbut side effects include \ufb02uid retention,\nheart failure, and osteopenia (167,168).\nDipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors do not\ninteract with immunosuppressant drugs\nand have demonstrated safety in small\nclinical trials (169,170). Well-designed inter-\nvention trials examining the ef\ufb01cacy and\nsafety of these and other antihyperglyce-\nmic agents in people with PTDM are\nneeded.\nMONOGENIC DIABETES SYNDROMES\nRecommendations\n2.23\nRegardless of current age, all\npeople diagnosed with diabe-\ntes in the \ufb01rst 6 months of\nlife should have immediate\ngenetic testing for neonatal\ndiabetes. A\n2.24\nChildren and young adults who\ndo not have typical characteris-\ntics of type 1 or type 2 diabetes\nand who often have a family\nhistory of diabetes in successive\ngenerations (suggestive of an\nautosomal dominant pattern\nof inheritance) should have\ngenetic testing for maturity-\nonset diabetes of the young. A\n2.25\nIn both instances, consultation\nwith a center specializing in\ndiabetes genetics is recom-\nmended to understand the\nsigni\ufb01cance of genetic muta-\ntions and how best to approach\nfurther evaluation, treatment,\nand genetic counseling. E\nMonogenic defects that cause b-cell\ndysfunction, such as neonatal diabetes\nand MODY, represent a small fraction of\npeople with diabetes (<5%). Table 2.6\ndescribes the most common causes of\nmonogenic diabetes. For a comprehen-\nsive list of causes, see Genetic Diagnosis\nof Endocrine Disorders (171).\nNeonatal Diabetes\nDiabetes occurring under 6 months of\nage is termed \u201cneonatal\u201d or \u201ccongenital\u201d\ndiabetes, and about 80\u201385% of cases\ncan be found to have an underlying\nmonogenic cause (8,172\u2013175). Neonatal\ndiabetes occurs much less often after\n6 months of age, whereas autoimmune\ntype 1 diabetes rarely occurs before\n6 months of age. Neonatal diabetes can\neither be transient or permanent. Tran-\nsient diabetes is most often due to over-\nexpression of genes on chromosome\n6q24, is recurrent in about half of cases,\nand may be treatable with medications\nother than insulin. Permanent neonatal\ndiabetes is most commonly due to auto-\nsomal dominant mutations in the genes\nencoding the Kir6.2 subunit (KCNJ11)\nand SUR1 subunit (ABCC8) of the b-cell\nKATP channel. A recent report details a\nde novo mutation in EIF2B1 affecting\neIF2 signaling associated with permanent\nneonatal diabetes and hepatic dys-\nfunction, similar to Wolcott-Rallison\nsyndrome but with few severe comor-\nbidities (176). The recent ADA-European\nAssociation for the Study of Diabetes\ntype 1 diabetes consensus report recom-\nmends that regardless of current age, in-\ndividuals diagnosed under 6 months of\nage should have genetic testing (8). Cor-\nrect diagnosis has critical implications be-\ncause 30\u201350% of people with KATP-related\nneonatal diabetes will exhibit improved\nblood glucose levels when treated with\nhigh-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of in-\nsulin. Insulin gene (INS) mutations are the\nsecond most common cause of perma-\nnent neonatal diabetes, and while inten-\nsive insulin management is currently the\npreferred treatment strategy, there are\nimportant genetic counseling considera-\ntions, as most of the mutations that cause\ndiabetes are dominantly inherited.\nMaturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young\nMODY is frequently characterized by on-\nset of hyperglycemia at an early age\n(classically before age 25 years, although\ndiagnosis may occur at older ages).\nMODY is characterized by impaired insu-\nlin secretion with minimal or no defects\nin insulin action (in the absence of coex-\nistent obesity). It is inherited in an autoso-\nmal dominant pattern with abnormalities\nin at least 13 genes on different chromo-\nsomes identi\ufb01ed to date (177). The most\ncommonly reported forms are GCK-MODY\n(MODY2), HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and\nHNF4A-MODY (MODY1).\nFor individuals with MODY, the treat-\nment implications are considerable and\nwarrant genetic testing (178,179). Clini-\ncally, people with GCK-MODY exhibit\nmild, stable fasting hyperglycemia and\ndo not require antihyperglycemic ther-\napy except commonly during pregnancy.\nS30\nClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Additionally, diag-\nnosis can lead to identi\ufb01cation of other\naffected family members. Genetic screen-\ning is increasingly available and cost-\neffective (176,178).\nA diagnosis of MODY should be con-\nsidered in individuals who have atypical\ndiabetes and multiple family members\nwith diabetes not characteristic of type 1\nor type 2 diabetes, although admit-\ntedly, \u201catypical diabetes\u201d is becoming\nincreasingly dif\ufb01cult to precisely de\ufb01ne\nin the absence of a de\ufb01nitive set of tests\nfor either type of diabetes (173\u2013175,\n178\u2013184). In most cases, the presence\nof autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes\nprecludes further testing for mono-\ngenic diabetes, but the presence of auto-\nantibodies in people with monogenic\ndiabetes has been reported (185). Indi-\nviduals in whom monogenic diabetes is\nsuspected should be referred to a spe-\ncialist for further evaluation if available,\nand consultation can be obtained from\nseveral centers. Readily available com-\nmercial genetic testing following the\ncriteria listed below now enables a\ncost-effective (186), often cost-saving, ge-\nnetic diagnosis that is increasingly sup-\nported by health insurance. A biomarker\nscreening pathway, such as the combina-\ntion of urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio\nand antibody screening, may aid in deter-\nmining who should get genetic testing for\nMODY (187). It is critical to correctly diag-\nnose one of the monogenic forms of di-\nabetes because these individuals may\nbe incorrectly diagnosed with type 1\nor type 2 diabetes, leading to subopti-\nmal, even potentially harmful, treatment\nplans and delays in diagnosing other\nfamily members (188). The correct diag-\nnosis is especially critical for those with\nGCK-MODY mutations, where multiple\nstudies have shown that no complications\nensue in the absence of glucose-lowering\ntherapy (189). The risks of microvascular\nand macrovascular complications with\nHNFIA- and HNF4A-MODY are similar\nto those observed in people with type 1\nand type 2 diabetes (190,191).

Hyperglycemia due to general\npancreatic dysfunction has been called\n\u201ctype 3c diabetes,\u201d and, more recently,\ndiabetes in the context of disease of\nthe exocrine pancreas has been termed\npancreoprivic diabetes (1). The diverse\nset of etiologies includes pancreatitis\n(acute and chronic), trauma or pancrea-\ntectomy, neoplasia, cystic \ufb01brosis (ad-\ndressed elsewhere in this chapter),\nhemochromatosis, \ufb01brocalculous pan-\ncreatopathy, rare genetic disorders (193),\nand idiopathic forms (1); as such, pancre-\natic diabetes is the preferred umbrella\nterminology.\nPancreatitis, even a single bout, can\nlead to postpancreatitis diabetes melli-\ntus (PPDM). Both acute and chronic pan-\ncreatitis can lead to PPDM, and the risk\nis highest with recurrent bouts. A distin-\nguishing feature is concurrent pancreatic\nexocrine insuf\ufb01ciency (according to the\nmonoclonal fecal elastase 1 test or direct\nfunction tests), pathological pancreatic\nimaging (endoscopic ultrasound, MRI,\ncomputed tomography), and absence\nof type 1 diabetes-associated autoim-\nmunity (194\u2013199). There is loss of both\ninsulin and glucagon secretion and often\nhigher-than-expected insulin requirements.\nRisk for microvascular complications ap-\npears to be similar to that of other\nforms of diabetes. In the context of pan-\ncreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can\nbe done to retain insulin secretion\n(200,201). In some cases, autotransplant\ncan lead to insulin independence.

B\n2.30\nIndividuals with a history of\ngestational diabetes mellitus\nfound to have prediabetes\nshould receive intensive life-\nstyle interventions and/or met-\nformin to prevent diabetes. A\nDe\ufb01nition\nFor many years, GDM was de\ufb01ned as\nany degree of glucose intolerance that\nwas \ufb01rst recognized during pregnancy\n(86), regardless of the degree of hyper-\nglycemia. This de\ufb01nition facilitated a\nuniform strategy for detection and clas-\nsi\ufb01cation of GDM, but this de\ufb01nition\nhas serious limitations (203). First, the\nbest available evidence reveals that many\ncases of GDM represent preexisting\nhyperglycemia that is detected by rou-\ntine screening in pregnancy, as routine\nscreening is not widely performed in\nnonpregnant individuals of reproduc-\ntive age. It is the severity of hypergly-\ncemia that is clinically important with\nregard to both short- and long-term\nmaternal and fetal risks.\nThe ongoing epidemic of obesity and\ndiabetes has led to more type 2 diabe-\ntes in people of reproductive age, with\nan increase in the number of pregnant\nindividuals with undiagnosed type 2 dia-\nbetes in early pregnancy (204\u2013206). Ide-\nally, undiagnosed diabetes should be\nidenti\ufb01ed preconception in individuals\nwith risk factors or in high-risk popula-\ntions (207\u2013212), as the preconception\ncare of people with preexisting diabetes\nresults in lower A1C and reduced risk of\nbirth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal\nmortality, small-for-gestational-age birth\nweight, and neonatal intensive care unit\nadmission (213). If individuals are not\nscreened prior to pregnancy, universal\nearly screening at <15 weeks of gestation\nfor undiagnosed diabetes may be consid-\nered over selective screening (Table\n2.3), particularly in populations with\nhigh prevalence of risk factors and un-\ndiagnosed diabetes in people of child-\nbearing age. Strong racial and ethnic\ndisparities exist in the prevalence of un-\ndiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, early\nscreening provides an initial step to\nidentify these health disparities so that\nthey\ncan\nbegin\nto\nbe\naddressed\n(209\u2013212). Standard diagnostic criteria\nfor identifying undiagnosed diabetes in\nearly pregnancy are the same as those\nused in the nonpregnant population\n(Table 2.2).

The Interna-\ntional Association of the Diabetes and\nPregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) GDM\ndiagnostic criteria for the 75-g OGTT, as\nwell as the GDM screening and diagnos-\ntic criteria used in the two-step ap-\nproach, were not derived from data in\nthe \ufb01rst half of pregnancy and should\nnot be used for early screening (223). To\ndate, most randomized controlled trials\nof treatment of early abnormal glucose\nmetabolism have been underpowered\nfor outcomes. Therefore, the bene\ufb01ts of\ntreatment for early abnormal glucose\nmetabolism remain uncertain. Nutrition\ncounseling and periodic \u201cblock\u201d testing\nof glucose levels weekly to identify indi-\nviduals with high glucose levels are sug-\ngested. Testing frequency may proceed\nto daily, and treatment may be intensi-\n\ufb01ed, if the fasting glucose is predomi-\nnantly >110 mg/dL prior to 18 weeks of\ngestation.\nBoth the fasting glucose and A1C are\nlow-cost tests. An advantage of the A1C\nis its convenience, as it can be added to\nthe prenatal laboratories and does not\nrequire an early-morning fasting ap-\npointment. Disadvantages include inac-\ncuracies in the presence of increased\nred blood cell turnover and hemoglo-\nbinopathies (usually reads lower) and\nhigher values with anemia and reduced\nred blood cell turnover (224). A1C is\nnot reliable to screen for GDM or for\npreexisting diabetes at 15 weeks of\ngestation or later. See Recommendation\n2.3 above.\nGDM is often indicative of underlying\nb-cell dysfunction (225), which confers\nmarked increased risk for later develop-\nment of diabetes, generally but not al-\nways type 2 diabetes, in the mother after\ndelivery (226,227). As effective prevention\ninterventions are available (228,229),\nindividuals diagnosed with GDM should\nreceive lifelong screening for prediabetes\nto allow interventions to reduce diabetes\nrisk and for type 2 diabetes to allow\ntreatment at the earliest possible time\n(230).\nDiagnosis\nGDM carries risks for the mother, fetus,\nand neonate. The Hyperglycemia and\nAdverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO)\nstudy (231), a large-scale multinational\ncohort study completed by more than\n23,000 pregnant individuals, demon-\nstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fe-\ntal, and neonatal outcomes continuously\nincreased as a function of maternal gly-\ncemia at 24\u201328 weeks of gestation,\neven within ranges previously consid-\nered normal for pregnancy. For most\ncomplications, there was no threshold\nfor risk. These results have led to careful\nreconsideration of the diagnostic criteria\nfor GDM.\nGDM diagnosis (Table 2.7) can be ac-\ncomplished with either of two strategies:\n1. The \u201cone-step\u201d 75-g OGTT derived\nfrom the IADPSG criteria, or\n2. The older \u201ctwo-step\u201d approach with\na 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed\nby a 100-g OGTT for those who\nscreen positive based on the work\nof Carpenter-Coustan\u2019s interpretation\nof the older O\u2019Sullivan and Mahan\n(232) criteria.\nDifferent diagnostic criteria will identify dif-\nferent degrees of maternal hyperglycemia\nand maternal/fetal risk, leading some ex-\nperts to debate, and disagree on, opti-\nmal strategies for the diagnosis of GDM.\nOne-Step Strategy\nThe IADPSG de\ufb01ned diagnostic cut points\nfor GDM as the average fasting, 1-h, and\n2-h PG values during a 75-g OGTT in in-\ndividuals at 24\u201328 weeks of gestation\nwho participated in the HAPO study at\nwhich odds\nfor\nadverse\noutcomes\nreached 1.75 times the estimated odds\nof these outcomes at the mean fasting,\n1-h, and 2-h PG levels of the study pop-\nulation. This\none-step\nstrategy\nwas\nanticipated to signi\ufb01cantly increase the inci-\ndence of GDM (from 5\u20136% to 15\u201320%),\nprimarily because only one abnormal value,\nTable 2.7\u2014Screening for and diagnosis of GDM\nOne-step strategy\nPerform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when patient is fasting and at 1 and\n2 h, at 24\u201328 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.\nThe OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.\nThe diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or\nexceeded:\n\u0001 Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)\n\u0001 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)\n\u0001 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)\nTwo-step strategy\nStep 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at\n24\u201328 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.\nIf the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is $130, 135, or 140 mg/dL\n(7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively), proceed to a 100-g OGTT.\nStep 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the patient is fasting.\nThe diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two* of the following four plasma glucose levels\n(measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan\ncriteria [251]):\n\u0001 Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)\n\u0001 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)\n\u0001 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)\n\u0001 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)\nGDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance\ntest. *American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that one elevated value\ncan be used for diagnosis (247).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes\nS33\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Many regional studies\nhave investigated the impact of adopting\nthe IADPSG criteria on prevalence and\nhave seen a roughly one- to threefold in-\ncrease (234). The anticipated increase\nin the incidence of GDM could have a\nsubstantial impact on costs and medical\ninfrastructure needs and has the po-\ntential to \u201cmedicalize\u201d pregnancies pre-\nviously categorized as normal. A recent\nfollow-up study of individuals participating\nin a blinded study of pregnancy OGTTs\nfound that 11 years after their pregnan-\ncies, individuals who would have been\ndiagnosed with GDM by the one-step\napproach, as compared with those\nwithout, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of\ndeveloping prediabetes and type 2 di-\nabetes and had children with a higher\nrisk of obesity and increased body fat,\nsuggesting that the larger group of indi-\nviduals identi\ufb01ed by the one-step ap-\nproach would bene\ufb01t from the increased\nscreening for diabetes and prediabetes\nthat would accompany a history of\nGDM (235,236). The ADA recommends\nthe IADPSG diagnostic criteria with the\nintent of optimizing gestational outcomes\nbecause these criteria are the only ones\nbased on pregnancy outcomes rather\nthan end points such as prediction of\nsubsequent maternal diabetes.\nThe expected bene\ufb01ts of using IADPSG\ncriteria to the offspring are inferred from\nintervention trials that focused on individ-\nuals with lower levels of hyperglycemia\nthan identi\ufb01ed using older GDM diag-\nnostic criteria. Those trials found mod-\nest bene\ufb01ts including reduced rates of\nlarge-for-gestational-age births and pre-\neclampsia (237,238). It is important to\nnote that 80\u201390% of participants being\ntreated for mild GDM in these two ran-\ndomized\ncontrolled\ntrials\ncould\nbe\nmanaged with lifestyle therapy alone.\nThe OGTT glucose cutoffs in these two\ntrials overlapped the thresholds recom-\nmended by the IADPSG, and in one trial\n(238), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL\n[7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the\ncutoff recommended by the IADPSG\n(153 mg/dL [8.5 mmol/L]).\nNo randomized controlled trials of\ntreating versus not treating GDM diag-\nnosed by the IADPSG criteria but not\nthe Carpenter-Coustan criteria have been\npublished to date. However, a recent\nrandomized trial of testing for GDM\nat 24\u201328 weeks of gestation by the\none-step method using IADPSG criteria ver-\nsus the two-step method using a 1-h 50-g\nglucose loading test (GLT) and, if posi-\ntive, a 3-h OGTT by Carpenter-Coustan\ncriteria identi\ufb01ed twice as many individu-\nals with GDM using the one-step method\ncompared with the two-step method.\nDespite treating more individuals for\nGDM using the one-step method, there\nwas no difference in pregnancy and peri-\nnatal complications (239). However, con-\ncerns have been raised about sample\nsize estimates and unanticipated sub-\noptimal engagement with the protocol\nwith regard to screening and treatment.\nFor example, in the two-step group, 165\nparticipants who did not get counted as\nhaving GDM were treated for isolated el-\nevated fasting glucose >95 mg/dL (240).\nThe high prevalence of prediabetes in\npeople of childbearing age may sup-\nport the more inclusive IADPSG criteria.\nNHANES data demonstrate a 21.5% preva-\nlence of prediabetes in people of reproduc-\ntive age 20\u201344 years, which is comparable\nto or higher than the prevalence of GDM di-\nagnosed by the one-step method (241).\nThe one-step method identi\ufb01es the\nlong-term risks of maternal prediabetes\nand diabetes and offspring abnormal glu-\ncose metabolism and adiposity. Post hoc\nGDM in individuals diagnosed by the one-\nstep method in the HAPO cohort was as-\nsociated with higher prevalence of IGT;\nhigher 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h glucoses dur-\ning the OGTT; and reduced insulin sensi-\ntivity and oral disposition index in their\noffspring at 10\u201314 years of age compared\nwith offspring of mothers without GDM.\nAssociations of mother\u2019s fasting, 1-h, and\n2-h values on the 75-g OGTT were contin-\nuous with a comprehensive panel of off-\nspring metabolic outcomes (236,242). In\naddition, HAPO Follow-up Study (HAPO\nFUS) data demonstrate that neonatal adi-\nposity and fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord\nC-peptide), both higher across the contin-\nuum of maternal hyperglycemia, are me-\ndiators of childhood body fat (243).\nData are lacking on how the treatment\nof mother\u2019s hyperglycemia in pregnancy\naffects her offspring\u2019s risk for obesity, dia-\nbetes, and other metabolic disorders. Ad-\nditional well-designed clinical studies are\nneeded to determine the optimal in-\ntensity of monitoring and treatment of\nindividuals with GDM diagnosed by the\none-step strategy (244,245).\nTwo-Step Strategy\nIn 2013, the NIH convened a consensus\ndevelopment conference to consider\ndiagnostic criteria for diagnosing GDM\n(246). The 15-member panel had repre-\nsentatives from obstetrics and gynecol-\nogy, maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics,\ndiabetes research, biostatistics, and other\nrelated \ufb01elds. The panel recommended a\ntwo-step approach to screening that used\na 1-h 50-g GLT followed by a 3-h 100-g\nOGTT for those who screened positive.\nThe American College of Obstetricians\nand Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends\nany of the commonly used thresholds\nof 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h\n50-g GLT (247). Updated from 2014, a\n2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\nsystematic review continues to conclude\nthat one-step versus two-step screening\nis associated with increased likelihood of\nGDM (11.5% vs. 4.9%) but without im-\nproved health outcomes. It reports that\nthe oral glucose challenge test using 140\nor 135 mg/dL thresholds had sensitivities\nof 82% and 93% and speci\ufb01cities of 82%\nand 79%, respectively, against Carpenter-\nCoustan criteria. Fasting plasma glucose\ncutoffs of 85 mg/dL or 90 mg/dL had\nsensitivities of 88% and 81% and specif-\nicities of 73% and 82%, respectively,\nagainst Carpenter-Coustan criteria (248).\nThe use of A1C at 24\u201328 weeks of gesta-\ntion as a screening test for GDM does\nnot function as well as the GLT (249).\nKey factors cited by the NIH panel in\ntheir decision-making process were the\nlack of clinical trial data demonstrating\nthe bene\ufb01ts of the one-step strategy\nand the potential negative consequences\nof identifying a large group of individu-\nals with GDM, including medicalization\nof pregnancy with increased health care\nutilization and costs. Moreover, screen-\ning with a 50-g GLT does not require\nfasting and therefore is easier to accom-\nplish for many individuals. Treatment\nof higher-threshold maternal hyper-\nglycemia, as identi\ufb01ed by the two-step\napproach, reduces rates of neonatal mac-\nrosomia, large-for-gestational-age births\n(250), and shoulder dystocia without\nincreasing small-for-gestational-age births.\nACOG currently supports the two-step ap-\nproach but notes that one elevated value,\nas opposed to two, may be used for the\ndiagnosis of GDM (247). If this approach\nis implemented, the incidence of GDM\nby the two-step strategy will likely\nincrease markedly.

A\nsecondary analysis of data from a ran-\ndomized clinical trial of identi\ufb01cation and\ntreatment of mild GDM (253) demon-\nstrated that treatment was similarly\nbene\ufb01cial in people meeting only the\nlower thresholds per Carpenter-Coustan\n(251) and in those meeting only the\nhigher thresholds per National Diabetes\nData Group (252). If the two-step ap-\nproach is used, it would appear advanta-\ngeous to use the Carpenter-Coustan\nlower diagnostic thresholds, as shown\nin step 2 in Table 2.7.\nFuture Considerations\nThe con\ufb02icting recommendations from\nexpert groups underscore the fact that\nthere are data to support each strategy.\nA systematic review of economic evalu-\nations of GDM screening found that the\none-step method identi\ufb01ed more cases\nof GDM and was more likely to be cost-\neffective than the two-step method\n(254). The decision of which strategy\nto implement must therefore be made\nbased on the relative values placed on\nfactors that have yet to be measured\n(e.g., willingness to change practice\nbased on correlation studies rather\nthan intervention trial results, available\ninfrastructure, and importance of cost\nconsiderations).\nThe IADPSG criteria (\u201cone-step strat-\negy\u201d) have been adopted internationally\nas the preferred approach. Data compar-\ning population-wide outcomes with one-\nstep versus two-step approaches have\nbeen inconsistent to date (239,255\u2013257).\nIn addition, pregnancies complicated by\nGDM per the IADPSG criteria, but not\nrecognized as such, have outcomes com-\nparable to pregnancies with diagnosed\nGDM by the more stringent two-step\ncriteria (258,259). There remains strong\nconsensus that establishing a uniform\napproach to diagnosing GDM will bene\ufb01t\npatients, caregivers, and policymakers.\nLonger-term outcome studies are currently\nunderway.\nReferences\n1.

    "text": "LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nFOR DIABETES PREVENTION\nRecommendations\n3.2 Refer adults with overweight/\nobesity at high risk of type 2 di-\nabetes, as typi\ufb01ed by the Diabetes\nPrevention Program (DPP), to an\nintensive lifestyle behavior change\nprogram to achieve and maintain\na weight reduction of at least 7%\nof initial body weight through\nhealthy reduced-calorie diet and\n$150 min/week of moderate-\nintensity physical activity. A\n3.3 A variety of eating patterns can\nbe considered to prevent dia-\nbetes in individuals with predi-\nabetes. B\n3.4 Given the cost-effectiveness of\nlifestyle behavior modi\ufb01cation\nprograms for diabetes preven-\ntion, such diabetes prevention\nprograms should be offered to\nadults at high risk of type 2 di-\nabetes. A Diabetes prevention\nprograms should be covered by\nthird-party payers, and incon-\nsistencies in access should be\naddressed.\n3.5 Based on individual preference,\ncerti\ufb01ed technology-assisted di-\nabetes\nprevention\nprograms\nmay be effective in preventing\ntype 2 diabetes and should be\nconsidered. B\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program\nSeveral major randomized controlled tri-\nals, including the Diabetes Prevention\nProgram (DPP) trial (1), the Finnish Dia-\nbetes Prevention Study (DPS) (2), and\nthe Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study\n(Da Qing study) (3), demonstrate that\nlifestyle/behavioral intervention with an\nindividualized reduced-calorie meal plan\nis highly effective in preventing or delay-\ning type 2 diabetes and improving other\ncardiometabolic markers (such as blood\npressure, lipids, and in\ufb02ammation) (4).\nThe strongest evidence for diabetes pre-\nvention in the U.S. comes from the DPP\ntrial (1). The DPP demonstrated that in-\ntensive lifestyle intervention could re-\nduce the risk of incident type 2 diabetes\nby 58% over 3 years. Follow-up of three\nlarge studies of lifestyle intervention for\ndiabetes prevention showed sustained\nreduction in the risk of progression\nto type 2 diabetes: 39% reduction at\n30 years in the Da Qing study (5), 43%\nreduction at 7 years in the Finnish DPS\n(2), and 34% reduction at 10 years (6)\nand 27% reduction at 15 years (7) in the\nU.S. Diabetes Prevention Program Out-\ncomes Study (DPPOS).\nThe two major goals of the DPP inten-\nsive lifestyle intervention were to achieve\nand maintain a minimum of 7% weight\nloss and 150 min moderate-intensity phys-\nical activity per week, such as brisk walk-\ning. The DPP lifestyle intervention was a\ngoal-based intervention. All participants\nwere given the same weight loss and\nphysical activity goals, but individualization\nwas permitted in the speci\ufb01c methods\nused to achieve the goals (8). Although\nweight loss was the most important fac-\ntor in reducing the risk of incident diabe-\ntes, it was also found that achieving the\ntarget behavioral goal of at least 150 min\nof physical activity per week, even without\nachieving the weight loss goal, reduced the\nincidence of type 2 diabetes by 44% (9).\nThe 7% weight loss goal was selected\nbecause it was feasible to achieve and\nmaintain and likely to lessen the risk of\ndeveloping diabetes. Participants were\nencouraged to achieve the $7% weight\nloss during the \ufb01rst 6 months of the in-\ntervention. Further analysis suggests max-\nimal prevention of diabetes with at least\n7\u201310% weight loss (9). The recommended\npace of weight loss was 1\u20132 lb/week. Cal-\norie goals were calculated by estimating\nthe daily calories needed to maintain the\nparticipant\u2019s initial weight and subtracting\n500\u20131,000 calories/day (depending on ini-\ntial body weight). The initial focus of the\ndietary intervention was on reducing total\nfat rather than calories. After several\nweeks, the concept of calorie balance\nand the need to restrict calories and fat\nwas introduced (8).\nThe goal for physical activity was se-\nlected to approximate at least 700 kcal/\nweek expenditure from physical activity.\nFor ease of translation, this goal was\ndescribed as at least 150 min of moderate-\nintensity physical activity per week, similar\nin intensity to brisk walking. Partici-\npants were encouraged to distribute\ntheir activity throughout the week with\na minimum frequency of three times\nper week and at least 10 min per ses-\nsion. A maximum of 75 min of strength\ntraining could be applied toward the\ntotal 150 min/week physical activity\ngoal (8).\nTo implement the weight loss and\nphysical activity goals, the DPP used an\nindividual model of treatment rather than\na group-based approach. This choice was\nbased on a desire to intervene before\nparticipants had the possibility of devel-\noping diabetes or losing interest in the\nprogram. The individual approach also al-\nlowed for the tailoring of interventions to\nre\ufb02ect the diversity of the population (8).\nThe DPP intervention was adminis-\ntered as a structured core curriculum fol-\nlowed by a \ufb02exible maintenance program\nof individual counseling, group sessions,\nmotivational campaigns, and restart op-\nportunities. The 16-session core curriculum\nwas completed within the \ufb01rst 24 weeks\nof the program. It included sessions on\nlowering calories, increasing physical ac-\ntivity, self-monitoring, maintaining healthy\nlifestyle behaviors, and guidance on\nmanaging psychological, social, and moti-\nvational challenges. Further details are\navailable regarding the core curriculum\nsessions (8).\nNutrition\nNutrition counseling for weight loss in the\nDPP lifestyle intervention arm included a\nreduction of total dietary fat and calories\n(1,8,9). However, evidence suggests that\nthere is not an ideal percentage of calo-\nries from carbohydrate, protein, and fat\nfor all people to prevent diabetes; there-\nfore, macronutrient distribution should be\nbased on an individualized assessment of\ncurrent eating patterns, preferences, and\nmetabolic goals (10). Based on other inter-\nvention trials, a variety of eating patterns\ncharacterized by the totality of food and\nbeverages habitually consumed (10,11)\nmay also be appropriate for individuals\nwith prediabetes (10), including Mediter-\nranean-style and low-carbohydrate eating\nplans (12\u201315). Observational studies have\nalso shown that vegetarian, plant-based\n(may include some animal products), and\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\n(DASH) eating patterns are associated\nwith a lower risk of developing type 2 di-\nabetes (16\u201319). Evidence suggests that\nthe overall quality of food consumed (as\nmeasured by the Healthy Eating Index,\nAlternative Healthy Eating Index, and\nDASH score), with an emphasis on whole\ngrains, legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegeta-\nbles and minimal re\ufb01ned and processed\nfoods, is also associated with a lower\nrisk of type 2 diabetes (18,20\u201322).

    "text": "the case for those with diabetes, individ-\nualized medical nutrition therapy (see\nSection 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes,\u201d for more detailed in-\nformation) is effective in lowering A1C\nin individuals diagnosed with prediabe-\ntes (23).\nPhysical Activity\nJust as 150 min/week of moderate-\nintensity physical activity, such as brisk\nwalking, showed bene\ufb01cial effects in\nthose with prediabetes (1), moderate-\nintensity physical activity has been shown\nto improve insulin sensitivity and reduce\nabdominal fat in children and young\nadults (24,25). Based on these \ufb01ndings,\nhealth care professionals are encouraged\nto promote a DPP-style program, includ-\ning a focus on physical activity, to all indi-\nviduals who have been identi\ufb01ed to be\nat an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In\naddition to aerobic activity, a physical ac-\ntivity plan designed to prevent diabetes\nmay include resistance training (8,26,27).\nBreaking up prolonged sedentary time\nmay also be encouraged, as it is associ-\nated with moderately lower postprandial\nglucose levels (28,29). The preventive ef-\nfects of physical activity appear to extend\nto the prevention of gestational diabetes\nmellitus (GDM) (30).\nDelivery and Dissemination of\nLifestyle Behavior Change for\nDiabetes Prevention\nBecause the intensive lifestyle interven-\ntion in the DPP was effective in prevent-\ning type 2 diabetes among those at high\nrisk for the disease and lifestyle behavior\nchange programs for diabetes prevention\nwere shown to be cost-effective, broader\nefforts to disseminate scalable lifestyle\nbehavior change programs for diabetes\nprevention with coverage by third-party\npayers ensued (31\u201335). Group delivery of\nDPP content in community or primary\ncare settings has demonstrated the po-\ntential to reduce overall program costs\nwhile still producing weight loss and dia-\nbetes risk reduction (36\u201340).\nThe Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) developed the National\nDiabetes Prevention Program (National\nDPP), a resource designed to bring such\nevidence-based lifestyle change programs\nfor preventing type 2 diabetes to com-\nmunities (cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/\nindex.htm). This online resource includes\nlocations of CDC-recognized diabetes pre-\nvention lifestyle change programs (cdc.\ngov/diabetes/prevention/\ufb01nd-a-program.\nhtml). To be eligible for this program, in-\ndividuals must have a BMI in the over-\nweight range and be at risk for diabetes\nbased on laboratory testing, a previous\ndiagnosis of GDM, or a positive risk test\n(cdc.gov/prediabetes/takethetest/). Dur-\ning the \ufb01rst 4 years of implementation of\nthe CDC\u2019s National DPP, 35.5% achieved\nthe 5% weight loss goal (41). The CDC\nhas also developed the Diabetes Pre-\nvention Impact Tool Kit (nccd.cdc.gov/\ntoolkit/diabetesimpact) to help organi-\nzations assess the economics of provid-\ning or covering the National DPP lifestyle\nchange program (42). In an effort to ex-\npand preventive services using a cost-\neffective model, the Centers for Medicare\n& Medicaid Services expanded Medicare\nreimbursement coverage for the National\nDPP lifestyle intervention to organiza-\ntions recognized by the CDC that be-\ncome Medicare suppliers for this service\n(innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/\nmedicare-diabetes-prevention-program).\nThe locations of Medicare DPPs are\navailable online at innovation.cms.gov/\ninnovation-models/medicare-diabetes-\nprevention-program/mdpp-map. To qual-\nify for Medicare coverage, individuals\nmust have BMI >25 kg/m2 (or BMI\n>23 kg/m2 if self-identi\ufb01ed as Asian)\nand laboratory testing consistent with pre-\ndiabetes in the last year. Medicaid cover-\nage of the DPP lifestyle intervention is also\nexpanding on a state-by-state basis.\nWhile CDC-recognized behavioral coun-\nseling programs, including Medicare DPP\nservices, have met minimum quality\nstandards and are reimbursed by many\npayers, lower retention rates have been\nreported for younger adults and racial/\nethnic minority populations (43). There-\nfore, other programs and modalities of\nbehavioral counseling for diabetes pre-\nvention may also be appropriate and ef-\n\ufb01cacious based on individual preferences\nand availability. The use of community\nhealth workers to support DPP efforts\nhas been shown to be effective and\ncost-effective (44,45) (see Section 1,\n\u201cImproving Care and Promoting Health\nin Populations,\u201d for more information).\nThe use of community health workers\nmay facilitate the adoption of behavior\nchanges for diabetes prevention while\nbridging barriers related to social deter-\nminants of health. However, coverage\nby third-party payers remains problem-\natic. Counseling by a registered dietitian\nnutritionist (RDN) has been shown to\nhelp individuals with prediabetes im-\nprove eating habits, increase physical\nactivity, and achieve 7\u201310% weight loss\n(10,46\u201348). Individualized medical nutri-\ntion therapy (see Section 5, \u201cFacilitating\nPositive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nto Improve Health Outcomes,\u201d for more\ndetailed information) is also effective in\nimproving glycemia in individuals diag-\nnosed with prediabetes (23,46). Further-\nmore, trials involving medical nutrition\ntherapy for adults with prediabetes found\nsigni\ufb01cant reductions in weight, waist\ncircumference, and glycemia. Individu-\nals with prediabetes can bene\ufb01t from\nreferral to an RDN for individualized\nmedical nutrition therapy upon diagnosis\nand at regular intervals throughout their\ntreatment plan (47,49). Other health care\nprofessionals, such as pharmacists and\ndiabetes care and education specialists,\nmay be considered for diabetes preven-\ntion efforts (50,51).\nTechnology-assisted programs may ef-\nfectively deliver the DPP program (52\u201357).\nSuch technology-assisted programs may\ndeliver content through smartphones,\nweb-based applications, and telehealth\nand may be an acceptable and ef\ufb01cacious\noption to bridge barriers, particularly for\nlow-income individuals and people resid-\ning in rural locations; however, not all pro-\ngrams are effective in helping people\nreach targets for diabetes prevention\n(52,58\u201360). The CDC Diabetes Preven-\ntion Recognition Program (DPRP) (cdc.\ngov/diabetes/prevention/requirements-\nrecognition.htm) certi\ufb01es technology-\nassisted modalities as effective vehicles\nfor DPP-based programs; such programs\nmust use an approved curriculum, include\ninteraction with a coach, and attain the\nDPP outcomes of participation, physical\nactivity reporting, and weight loss. There-\nfore, health care professionals should con-\nsider referring adults with prediabetes\nto certi\ufb01ed technology-assisted DPP pro-\ngrams based on their preferences.\nPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS\nRecommendations\n3.6 Metformin therapy for the pre-\nvention of type 2 diabetes should\nbe considered in adults at high\nrisk of type 2 diabetes, as typi-\n\ufb01ed by the Diabetes Prevention\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\nS43\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

A\n3.7 Long-term\nuse\nof\nmetformin\nmay be associated with bio-\nchemical vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency;\nconsider periodic measurement\nof vitamin B12 levels in metfor-\nmin-treated\nindividuals,\nespe-\ncially in those with anemia or\nperipheral neuropathy. B\nBecause weight loss through behavior\nchanges in diet and physical activity alone\ncan be dif\ufb01cult to maintain long term (6),\npeople at high risk of diabetes may bene-\n\ufb01t from support and additional pharma-\ncotherapeutic options, if needed. Various\npharmacologic agents used to treat dia-\nbetes have been evaluated for diabetes\nprevention. Metformin, a-glucosidase in-\nhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor\nagonists (liraglutide, semaglutide), thia-\nzolidinediones, testosterone (61), and in-\nsulin have been shown to lower the\nincidence of diabetes in speci\ufb01c popula-\ntions (62\u201367), whereas diabetes preven-\ntion was not seen with nateglinide (68).\nIn the DPP, weight loss was an impor-\ntant factor in reducing the risk of pro-\ngression, with every kilogram of weight\nloss conferring a 16% reduction in risk\nof progression over 3.2 years (9). In\npostpartum individuals with GDM, the risk\nof type 2 diabetes increased by 18% for\nevery 1 unit BMI above the preconception\nbaseline (69). Several medications evalu-\nated for weight loss (e.g., orlistat, phenter-\nmine topiramate, liraglutide, semaglutide,\nand tirzepatide) have been shown to de-\ncrease the incidence of diabetes to various\ndegrees in those with prediabetes (67,\n70\u201372).\nStudies of other pharmacologic agents\nhave shown some ef\ufb01cacy in diabetes\nprevention with valsartan but no ef\ufb01-\ncacy in preventing diabetes with ramipril\nor anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (73\u201376). Al-\nthough the Vitamin D and Type 2 Dia-\nbetes (D2d) prospective randomized\ncontrolled trial showed no signi\ufb01cant\nbene\ufb01t of vitamin D versus placebo on\nthe progression to type 2 diabetes in\nindividuals at high risk (77), post hoc\nanalyses and meta-analyses suggest a\npotential bene\ufb01t in speci\ufb01c populations\n(77\u201380). Further research is needed to\nde\ufb01ne characteristics and clinical indica-\ntors where vitamin D supplementation\nmay be of bene\ufb01t (61).\nNo pharmacologic agent has been ap-\nproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-\nministration for a speci\ufb01c indication of\ntype 2 diabetes prevention. The risk ver-\nsus bene\ufb01t of each medication in sup-\nport of person-centered goals must be\nweighed in addition to cost, side effects,\nand ef\ufb01cacy considerations. Metformin\nhas the longest history of safety data as\na pharmacologic therapy for diabetes\nprevention (81).\nMetformin was overall less effective\nthan lifestyle modi\ufb01cation in the DPP,\nthough group differences declined over\ntime in the DPPOS (7), and metformin\nmay be cost-saving over a 10-year pe-\nriod (33). In the DPP, metformin was as\neffective as lifestyle modi\ufb01cation in par-\nticipants with BMI $35 kg/m2 and in\nyounger participants aged 25\u201344 years\n(1). In individuals with a history of GDM\nin the DPP, metformin and intensive life-\nstyle modi\ufb01cation led to an equivalent\n50% reduction in diabetes risk (82).\nBoth interventions remained highly effec-\ntive during a 10-year follow-up period\n(83). By the time of the 15-year follow-\nup (DPPOS), exploratory analyses demon-\nstrated that participants with a higher\nbaseline fasting glucose ($110 mg/dL\nvs. 95\u2013109 mg/dL), those with a higher\nA1C (6.0\u20136.4% vs. <6.0%), and individuals\nwith a history of GDM (vs. individuals with-\nout a history of GDM) experienced higher\nrisk reductions with metformin, identifying\nsubgroups of participants that bene\ufb01tted\nthe most from metformin (84). In the In-\ndian Diabetes Prevention Program (IDPP-1),\nmetformin and lifestyle intervention re-\nduced diabetes risk similarly at 30 months;\nof note, the lifestyle intervention in IDPP-1\nwas less intensive than that in the DPP\n(85). Based on \ufb01ndings from the DPP, met-\nformin should be recommended as an op-\ntion for high-risk individuals (e.g., those\nwith a history of GDM or those with BMI\n$35 kg/m2). Consider periodic monitoring\nof vitamin B12 levels in those taking\nmetformin chronically to check for pos-\nsible de\ufb01ciency (86,87) (see Section 9,\n\u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic\nTreatment,\u201d for more details). While\nthere is not a universally accepted rec-\nommended periodicity of monitoring, it is\nnotable that the lowering effect of met-\nformin on vitamin B12 increases with\ntime (88), with a signi\ufb01cantly higher risk\nfor vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency (<150 pmol/L)\nnoted at 4.3 years in the HOME (Hyperin-\nsulinaemia: the Outcome of its Metabolic\nEffects) study (88) and signi\ufb01cantly greater\nrisk of low B12 levels (#203 pg/mL) at\n5 years in the DPP (87). It has been sug-\ngested that a person who has been on\nmetformin for more than 4 years or is at\nrisk for vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency should be\nmonitored for vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency an-\nnually (89).\nPREVENTION OF VASCULAR\nDISEASE AND MORTALITY\nRecommendations\n3.8\nPrediabetes is associated with\nheightened cardiovascular risk;\ntherefore,\nscreening\nfor\nand\ntreatment of modi\ufb01able risk fac-\ntors for cardiovascular disease\nare suggested. B\n3.9\nStatin therapy may increase the\nrisk of type 2 diabetes in peo-\nple at high risk of developing\ntype 2 diabetes. In such individ-\nuals, glucose status should be\nmonitored regularly and diabe-\ntes prevention approaches rein-\nforced. It is not recommended\nthat statins be discontinued. B\n3.10 In people with a history of\nstroke and evidence of insulin\nresistance and prediabetes, pio-\nglitazone may be considered to\nlower the risk of stroke or myo-\ncardial infarction. However, this\nbene\ufb01t needs to be balanced\nwith the increased risk of weight\ngain, edema, and fracture. A\nLower doses may mitigate the\nrisk of adverse effects. C\nPeople with prediabetes often have\nother cardiovascular risk factors, includ-\ning hypertension and dyslipidemia (90),\nand are at increased risk for cardiovas-\ncular disease (91,92). If indicated, evalu-\nation for tobacco use and referral for\ntobacco cessation should be part of rou-\ntine care for those at risk for diabetes.\nOf note, the years immediately follow-\ning smoking cessation may represent\na time of increased risk for diabetes\n(93\u201395), a time when individuals should\nS44\nPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

See\nSection 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes,\u201d for more detailed in-\nformation. The lifestyle interventions for\nweight loss in study populations at risk\nfor type 2 diabetes have shown a reduc-\ntion in cardiovascular risk factors and\nthe need for medications used to treat\nthese cardiovascular risk factors (96,97).\nIn longer-term follow-up, lifestyle inter-\nventions for diabetes prevention also\nprevented the development of micro-\nvascular complications among women\nenrolled in the DPPOS and in the study\npopulation enrolled in the China Da Qing\nDiabetes Prevention Outcome Study (7,98).\nThe lifestyle intervention in the latter\nstudy was also ef\ufb01cacious in preventing\ncardiovascular disease and mortality at\n23 and 30 years of follow-up (3,5). Treat-\nment goals and therapies for hyperten-\nsion and dyslipidemia in the primary\nprevention of cardiovascular disease for\npeople with prediabetes should be based\non their level of cardiovascular risk. In-\ncreased vigilance is warranted to identify\nand treat these and other cardiovascular\ndiseases risk factors (99). Statins have\nbeen associated with a modestly in-\ncreased risk of diabetes (100\u2013104). In\nthe DPP, statin use was associated with\ngreater diabetes risk irrespective of the\ntreatment group (pooled hazard ratio\n[95% CI] for incident diabetes 1.36 [1.17\u2013\n1.58]) (102). In studies of primary pre-\nvention of cardiovascular disease, cardio-\nvascular and mortality bene\ufb01ts of statin\ntherapy exceed the risk of diabetes\n(105,106), suggesting a favorable bene\ufb01t-\nto-harm balance with statin therapy.\nHence, discontinuation of statins is not\nrecommended in this population due to\nconcerns of diabetes risk.\nCardiovascular outcome trials in people\nwithout diabetes also inform risk reduc-\ntion potential in people without diabetes\nat increased cardiometabolic risk (see\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d for more details). The\nIRIS (Insulin Resistance Intervention after\nStroke) trial was a dedicated study of\npeople with a recent (<6 months) stroke\nor transient ischemic attack, without dia-\nbetes but with insulin resistance, as de-\n\ufb01ned by a HOMA of insulin resistance\nindex of $3.0, evaluating pioglitazone\n(target dose of 45 mg daily) compared\nwith placebo. At 4.8 years, the risk of\nstroke or myocardial infarction, as well as\nthe risk of diabetes, was lower within the\npioglitazone group than with placebo,\nthough risks of weight gain, edema, and\nfracture were higher in the pioglitazone\ntreatment group (107\u2013109). Lower doses\nmay mitigate the adverse effects, though\nfurther study is needed to con\ufb01rm the\nbene\ufb01t at lower doses (110).\nPERSON-CENTERED CARE GOALS\nRecommendations\n3.11 In adults with overweight/\nobesity at high risk of type 2\ndiabetes, care goals should in-\nclude weight loss or preven-\ntion of weight gain, minimizing\nthe progression of hypergly-\ncemia, and attention to cardio-\nvascular risk and associated\ncomorbidities. B\n3.12 Pharmacotherapy (e.g., for weight\nmanagement, minimizing the\nprogression of hyperglycemia,\ncardiovascular risk reduction)\nmay be considered to support\nperson-centered care goals. B\n3.13 More intensive preventive ap-\nproaches should be considered\nin individuals who are at partic-\nularly high risk of progression\nto diabetes, including individuals\nwith BMI $35 kg/m2, those at\nhigher glucose levels (e.g., fasting\nplasma glucose 110\u2013125 mg/dL,\n2-h postchallenge glucose 173\u2013\n199 mg/dL, A1C $6.0%), and\nindividuals with a history of ges-\ntational diabetes mellitus. A\nIndividualized risk/bene\ufb01t should be con-\nsidered in screening, intervention, and\nmonitoring to prevent or delay type 2\ndiabetes and associated comorbidities.\nMultiple factors, including age, BMI, and\nother comorbidities, may in\ufb02uence the\nrisk of progression to diabetes and life-\ntime risk of complications (111,112). In\nthe DPP, which enrolled high-risk individ-\nuals with impaired glucose tolerance, ele-\nvated fasting glucose, and elevated BMI,\nthe crude incidence of diabetes within\nthe placebo arm was 11.0 cases per\n100 person-years, with a cumulative\n3-year incidence of diabetes of 28.9% (1).\nCharacteristics of individuals in the DPP/\nDPPOS who were at particularly high risk\nof progression to diabetes (crude inci-\ndence of diabetes 14\u201322 cases/100 person-\nyears) included BMI $35 kg/m2, those at\nhigher glucose levels (e.g., fasting plasma\nglucose 110\u2013125 mg/dL, 2-h postchallenge\nglucose 173\u2013199 mg/dL, and A1C $6.0%),\nand individuals with a history of gestational\ndiabetes (1,82,83). In contrast, in the\ncommunity-based Atherosclerosis Risk\nin Communities (ARIC) study, observa-\ntional follow-up of older adults (mean\nage 75 years) with laboratory evidence\nof prediabetes (based on A1C 5.7\u20136.4%\nand/or fasting glucose 100\u2013125 mg/dL),\nbut not meeting speci\ufb01c BMI criteria,\nfound much lower progression to diabe-\ntes over 6 years: 9% of those with A1C-\nde\ufb01ned prediabetes, 8% with impaired\nfasting glucose (112).\nThus, it is important to individualize\nthe risk/bene\ufb01t of intervention and con-\nsider person-centered goals. Risk models\nhave explored risk-based bene\ufb01t, gener-\nally \ufb01nding higher bene\ufb01t of the inter-\nvention in those at highest risk (9).\nDiabetes prevention and observational\nstudies highlight key principles that may\nguide person-centered goals. In the DPP,\nwhich enrolled a high-risk population\nmeeting criteria for overweight/obesity,\nweight loss was an important mediator\nof diabetes prevention or delay, with\ngreater metabolic bene\ufb01t generally seen\nwith greater weight loss (9,113). In the\nDPP/DPPOS, progression to diabetes,\nduration of diabetes, and mean level of\nglycemia were important determinants\nof the development of microvascular\ncomplications (7). Furthermore, the abil-\nity to achieve normal glucose regulation,\neven once, during the DPP was associ-\nated with a lower risk of diabetes and\nlower risk of microvascular complications\n(114). Observational follow-up of the\nDa Qing study also showed that regres-\nsion from impaired glucose tolerance to\nnormal glucose tolerance or remaining\nwith impaired glucose tolerance rather\nthan progressing to type 2 diabetes at\nthe end of the 6-year intervention trial\nresulted in signi\ufb01cantly lower risk of car-\ndiovascular disease and microvascular\ndisease over 30 years (115). Prediabetes\nis associated with increased cardio-\nvascular disease and mortality (92),\nemphasizing the importance of at-\ntending to cardiovascular risk in this\npopulation.\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities\nS45\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

This individualized management\nplan should take into account the per-\nson\u2019s age, cognitive abilities, school/\nwork schedule and conditions, health\nbeliefs, support systems, eating patterns,\nphysical activity, social situation, \ufb01nancial\nconcerns, cultural factors, literacy and nu-\nmeracy (mathematical literacy), diabetes\nhistory (duration, complications, current\nuse of medications), comorbidities, dis-\nabilities, health priorities, other medical\nconditions, preferences for care, and life\nexpectancy. Various strategies and tech-\nniques should be used to support the\nperson\u2019s self-management efforts, includ-\ning providing education on problem-\nsolving skills for all aspects of diabetes\nmanagement.\nHealth care professional communica-\ntion with people with diabetes and fami-\nlies should acknowledge that multiple\nfactors impact glycemic management but\nalso emphasize that collaboratively devel-\noped treatment plans and a healthy life-\nstyle can signi\ufb01cantly improve disease\noutcomes and well-being (4\u20138). Thus, the\ngoal of communication between health\ncare professionals and people with dia-\nbetes is to establish a collaborative rela-\ntionship and to assess and address self-\nmanagement\nbarriers\nwithout\nblaming\npeople with diabetes for \u201cnoncompliance\u201d\nor \u201cnonadherence\u201d when the outcomes of\nself-management are not optimal (9). The\nfamiliar\nterms\n\u201cnoncompliance\u201d\nand\n\u201cnonadherence\u201d denote a passive, obe-\ndient role for a person with diabetes in\n\u201cfollowing doctor\u2019s orders\u201d that is at\nodds with the active role people with\ndiabetes take in directing the day-to-day\ndecision-making, planning, monitoring,\nevaluation, and problem-solving involved\nin diabetes self-management. Using a\nnonjudgmental approach that normalizes\nperiodic lapses in management may help\nminimize the person\u2019s resistance to re-\nporting problems with self-management.\nEmpathizing and using active listening\ntechniques, such as open-ended ques-\ntions, re\ufb02ective statements, and summa-\nrizing what the person said, can help\nfacilitate communication. Perceptions of\npeople with diabetes about their own\nability, or self-ef\ufb01cacy, to self-manage\ndiabetes constitute one important psy-\nchosocial factor related to improved dia-\nbetes self-management and treatment\noutcomes in diabetes (10\u201312) and should\nbe a target of ongoing assessment, edu-\ncation, and treatment planning.\nLanguage has a strong impact on per-\nceptions and behavior. The use of em-\npowering language in diabetes care and\neducation can help to inform and moti-\nvate people, yet language that shames\nFigure 4.1\u2014Decision cycle for person-centered glycemic management in type 2 diabetes.

    "text": "and judges may undermine this effort.\nThe\nAmerican\nDiabetes\nAssociation\n(ADA) and the Association of Diabetes\nCare & Education Specialists (formerly\ncalled the American Association of Dia-\nbetes Educators) joint consensus report,\n\u201cThe Use of Language in Diabetes Care\nand Education,\u201d provides the authors\u2019\nexpert opinion regarding the use of lan-\nguage\nby\nhealth\ncare\nprofessionals\nwhen speaking or writing about dia-\nbetes for people with diabetes or for\nprofessional audiences (13). Although\nfurther research is needed to address\nthe impact of language on diabetes out-\ncomes, the report includes \ufb01ve key con-\nsensus recommendations for language\nuse:\n\u2022 Use language that is neutral, non-\njudgmental,\nand\nbased\non\nfacts,\nactions, or physiology/biology.\n\u2022 Use language free from stigma.\n\u2022 Use language that is strength based,\nrespectful, and inclusive and that im-\nparts hope.\n\u2022 Use language that fosters collabora-\ntion between people with diabetes\nand health care professionals.\n\u2022 Use language that is person centered\n(e.g., \u201cperson with diabetes\u201d is pre-\nferred over \u201cdiabetic\u201d).\nCOMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL\nEVALUATION\nRecommendations\n4.3\nA complete medical evalua-\ntion should be performed at\nthe initial visit to:\n\u2022 Con\ufb01rm the diagnosis and\nclassify diabetes. A\n\u2022 Evaluate for diabetes compli-\ncations, potential comorbid\nconditions, and overall health\nstatus. A\n\u2022 Review previous treatment\nand risk factor management\nin people with established\ndiabetes. A\n\u2022 Begin engagement with the\nperson with diabetes in\nthe formulation of a care\nmanagement plan including\ninitial goals of care. A\n\u2022 Develop a plan for continuing\ncare. A\n4.4\nA follow-up visit should include\nmost components of the initial\ncomprehensive medical evalua-\ntion (Table 4.1). A\n4.5\nOngoing management should\nbe guided by the assessment\nof overall health status, diabe-\ntes complications, cardiovascu-\nlar risk, hypoglycemia risk, and\nshared decision-making to set\ntherapeutic goals. B\nThe comprehensive medical evaluation\nincludes the initial and follow-up evalua-\ntions, assessment of complications, psy-\nchosocial assessment, management of\ncomorbid conditions, overall health sta-\ntus, and engagement of the person with\ndiabetes throughout the process. While a\ncomprehensive list is provided in Table 4.1,\nin clinical practice the health care pro-\nfessional may need to prioritize the\ncomponents of the medical evaluation\ngiven the available resources and time.\nThe goal is to provide the health care\nteam information so it can optimally sup-\nport people with diabetes. In addition to\nthe medical history, physical examina-\ntion, and laboratory tests, health care\nprofessionals should assess diabetes self-\nmanagement behaviors, nutrition, social\ndeterminants of health, and psychosocial\nhealth (see Section 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive\nHealth Behaviors and Well-being to\nImprove Health Outcomes\u201d) and give\nguidance on routine immunizations. The\nassessment of sleep pattern and duration\nshould be considered; a meta-analysis\nfound that poor sleep quality, short sleep,\nand long sleep were associated with\nhigher A1C in people with type 2 diabe-\ntes (14). Interval follow-up visits should\noccur at least every 3\u20136 months individu-\nalized to the person and then at least\nannually.\nLifestyle management and psychosocial\ncare are the cornerstones of diabetes\nmanagement. People with diabetes\nshould be referred for diabetes self-\nmanagement education and support,\nmedical nutrition therapy, and assess-\nment of psychosocial/emotional health\nconcerns if indicated. People with diabe-\ntes should receive recommended preven-\ntive care services (e.g., immunizations,\ncancer\nscreening);\nsmoking\ncessation\ncounseling; and ophthalmological, den-\ntal, and podiatric referrals, as needed.\nThe assessment of risk of acute and\nchronic\ndiabetes\ncomplications\nand\ntreatment planning are key components\nof initial and follow-up visits (Table 4.2).\nThe risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascu-\nlar disease and heart failure (see Sec-\ntion 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk\nManagement\u201d), chronic kidney disease\nstaging (see Section 11, \u201cChronic Kidney\nDisease and Risk Management\u201d), pres-\nence of retinopathy (see Section 12,\n\u201cRetinopathy,\nNeuropathy,\nand\nFoot\nCare\u201d), and risk of treatment-associated\nhypoglycemia (Table 4.3) should be used\nto individualize targets for glycemia (see\nSection 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets\u201d), blood pres-\nsure, and lipids and to select speci\ufb01c glu-\ncose-lowering medication (see Section 9,\n\u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic\nTreatment\u201d), antihypertension medication,\nand statin treatment intensity.\nAdditional referrals should be arranged\nas necessary (Table 4.4). Clinicians should\nensure that people with diabetes are\nappropriately screened for complications\nand comorbidities. Discussing and imple-\nmenting an approach to glycemic man-\nagement with the person is a part, not\nthe sole goal, of the clinical encounter.\nIMMUNIZATIONS\nRecommendation\n4.6\nProvide routinely recommended\nvaccinations for children and\nadults with diabetes as indi-\ncated by age (see Table 4.5 for\nhighly recommended vaccina-\ntions for adults with diabetes). A\nThe importance of routine vaccinations\nfor people living with diabetes has been\nelevated by the coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Preventing\navoidable infections not only directly\nprevents morbidity but also reduces\nhospitalizations, which may additionally\nreduce risk of acquiring infections such\nas COVID-19. Children and adults with\ndiabetes should receive vaccinations ac-\ncording to age-appropriate recommen-\ndations (15,16). The Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) provides\nvaccination schedules speci\ufb01cally for chil-\ndren, adolescents, and adults with diabe-\ntes (cdc.gov/vaccines/). The CDC Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) makes recommendations based\non its own review and rating of the\nevidence, provided in Table 4.5 for se-\nlected vaccinations.

Peo-\nple with diabetes are at increased risk for\nthe bacteremic form of pneumococcal in-\nfection and have been reported to have\na high risk of nosocomial bacteremia,\nwith a mortality rate as high as 50% (21).\nThere are two types of vaccines available\nin the\nU.S., pneumococcal\nconjugate\nvaccines (PCV13, PCV15, and PCV20) and\npneumococcal\npolysaccharide\nvaccine\n(PPSV23), with distinct schedules for chil-\ndren and adults.\nIt is recommended that all children re-\nceive a four-dose series of PCV13 or\nPCV15 by 15 months of age. For children\nwith diabetes who have incomplete se-\nries by ages 2\u20135 years, the CDC recom-\nmends a catch-up schedule to ensure\nthat these children have four doses. Chil-\ndren with diabetes between 6 and 18\nyears of age are also advised to receive\none dose of PPSV23, preferably after re-\nceipt of PCV13.\nAdults aged $65 years whose vaccine\nstatus is unknown or who have not re-\nceived pneumococcal vaccine should re-\nceive one dose of PCV15 or PCV20. If\nPCV15 is used, it should be followed by\nPPSV23.\nAdults aged 19\u201364 years with certain\nunderlying risk factors or other medical\nconditions whose vaccine status is un-\nknown or who have not received pneu-\nmococcal vaccine should receive one\ndose of PCV15 or PCV20. As for adults\naged $65 years, if PCV15 is used, it\nshould be followed by PPSV23.\nThe recommended interval between\nPCV15 and PPSV23 is $1 year. If PPSV23\nis the only dose received, PCV15 or\nPCV20 may be given $1 year later.\nFor adults with immunocompromising\nconditions, cochlear implant, or cerebro-\nspinal \ufb02uid leak, a minimum interval of\n8 weeks can be considered for dosing of\nPCV15 and PPSV23 when PCV15 has been\nused.\nAdults who received PCV13 should fol-\nlow the previously recommended PPSV23\nseries. Adults who received only PPSV23\nmay receive a PCV15 or PCV20 $1 year\nafter their last dose.\nHepatitis B\nCompared with the general population,\npeople with type 1 or type 2 diabetes\nhave higher rates of hepatitis B. This\nmay be due to contact with infected blood\nor through improper equipment use (glu-\ncose monitoring devices or infected nee-\ndles). Because of the higher likelihood of\ntransmission, hepatitis B vaccine is recom-\nmended for adults with diabetes aged\n<60 years.

Diabetes comorbidities\nare conditions that affect people with di-\nabetes more often than age-matched\npeople without diabetes. This section\ndiscusses many of the common comor-\nbidities observed in people with diabetes\nbut is not necessarily inclusive of all the\nconditions that have been reported.\nAutoimmune Diseases\nRecommendations\n4.7\nPeople with type 1 diabetes should\nbe screened for autoimmune\nthyroid disease soon after diagno-\nsis and periodically thereafter. B\n4.8\nAdults with type 1 diabetes\nshould be screened for celiac\ndisease in the presence of gas-\ntrointestinal symptoms, signs,\nlaboratory\nmanifestations,\nor\nclinical suspicion suggestive of\nceliac disease. B\nPeople with type 1 diabetes are at in-\ncreased risk for other autoimmune dis-\neases, with thyroid disease, celiac disease,\nand pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 de\ufb01-\nciency) being among the most common\n(30). Other associated conditions include\nautoimmune hepatitis, primary adrenal\ninsuf\ufb01ciency (Addison disease), collagen\nvascular diseases, and myasthenia gravis\n(31\u201334). Type 1 diabetes may also occur\nwith other autoimmune diseases in the\ncontext of speci\ufb01c genetic disorders or\npolyglandular\nautoimmune\nsyndromes\n(35). Given the high prevalence, nonspe-\nci\ufb01c symptoms, and insidious onset of pri-\nmary hypothyroidism, routine screening\nfor thyroid dysfunction is recommended\nfor all people with type 1 diabetes.\nScreening for celiac disease should be\nconsidered in adults with diabetes with\nsuggestive\nsymptoms\n(e.g.,\ndiarrhea,\nmalabsorption, abdominal pain) or signs\n(e.g., osteoporosis, vitamin de\ufb01ciencies,\niron de\ufb01ciency anemia) (36,37).

People\nwith diabetes should be encouraged to\nundergo recommended age- and sex-\nappropriate cancer screenings and to re-\nduce their modi\ufb01able cancer risk factors\n(obesity, physical inactivity, and smok-\ning). New onset of atypical diabetes\n(lean body habitus, negative family his-\ntory) in a middle-aged or older person\nmay precede the diagnosis of pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (40). However, in the\nabsence of other symptoms (e.g., weight\nloss, abdominal pain), routine screening\nof all such individuals is not currently\nrecommended.\nCognitive Impairment/Dementia\nRecommendation\n4.9\nIn the presence of cognitive\nimpairment, diabetes treat-\nment plans should be simpli-\n\ufb01ed as much as possible and\ntailored to minimize the risk of\nhypoglycemia. B\nDiabetes is associated with a signi\ufb01cantly\nincreased risk and rate of cognitive de-\ncline and an increased risk of dementia\n(41,42). A recent meta-analysis of pro-\nspective observational studies in people\nwith diabetes showed 73% increased risk\nof all types of dementia, 56% increased\nrisk of Alzheimer dementia, and 127% in-\ncreased risk of vascular dementia com-\npared with individuals without diabetes\n(43). The reverse is also true: people\nwith Alzheimer dementia are more likely\nto develop diabetes than people without\nAlzheimer dementia. In a 15-year pro-\nspective study of community-dwelling\npeople >60 years of age, the presence\nof diabetes at baseline signi\ufb01cantly in-\ncreased the age- and sex-adjusted inci-\ndence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer\ndementia, and vascular dementia com-\npared with rates in those with normal\nglucose tolerance (44). See Section 13,\n\u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for a more detailed dis-\ncussion regarding screening for cognitive\nimpairment.\nHyperglycemia\nIn those with type 2 diabetes, the de-\ngree and duration of hyperglycemia are\nrelated to dementia. More rapid cogni-\ntive decline is associated with both in-\ncreased A1C and longer duration of\ndiabetes (43). The Action to Control\nCardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)\nstudy found that each 1% higher A1C\nlevel was associated with lower cogni-\ntive function in individuals with type 2\ndiabetes (45). However, the ACCORD\nstudy found no difference in cognitive\noutcomes in participants randomly as-\nsigned to intensive and standard glycemic\nmanagement, supporting the recommen-\ndation that intensive glucose manage-\nment should not be advised for the\nimprovement of cognitive function in\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes (46).\nHypoglycemia\nIn type 2 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia\nis associated with reduced cognitive func-\ntion, and those with poor cognitive func-\ntion have more severe hypoglycemia. In a\nlong-term study of older people with\ntype 2 diabetes, individuals with one\nor more recorded episodes of severe\nhypoglycemia had a stepwise increase in\nrisk of dementia (47). Likewise, the AC-\nCORD trial found that as cognitive func-\ntion\ndecreased,\nthe\nrisk\nof\nsevere\nhypoglycemia increased (48). This has\nalso been demonstrated in people with\ntype 1 diabetes. Tailoring glycemic ther-\napy may help to prevent hypoglycemia\nin individuals with cognitive dysfunction\n(49). See Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for\nmore detailed discussion of hypoglyce-\nmia in older people with type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes.\nNutrition\nIn one study, following the Mediterranean\ndiet correlated with improved cognitive\nfunction (50). However, a Cochrane re-\nview found insuf\ufb01cient evidence to rec-\nommend any speci\ufb01c dietary change for\nthe prevention or treatment of cognitive\ndysfunction (51).\nStatins\nA systematic review has reported that\ndata do not support an adverse effect of\nstatins on cognition (52). The FDA post-\nmarketing surveillance databases have\nalso revealed a low reporting rate for\ncognitive function\u2013related adverse events,\nincluding cognitive dysfunction or de-\nmentia, with statin therapy, similar to\nrates seen with other commonly pre-\nscribed cardiovascular medications (52).\nTherefore, fear of cognitive decline\nshould not be a barrier to statin use in\npeople with diabetes and a high risk for\ncardiovascular disease.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\nRecommendation\n4.10 People with type 2 diabetes\nor prediabetes with cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors, who\nhave either elevated liver en-\nzymes (ALT) or fatty liver on\nimaging or ultrasound, should\nbe evaluated for presence of\nnonalcoholic steatohepatitis and\nliver \ufb01brosis. C\nScreening\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nis the term used to identify the broad\nspectrum of the disease ranging from\nnonalcoholic fatty liver with macrovesic-\nular hepatic steatosis only (or with mild\nin\ufb02ammation) to steatohepatitis (non-\nalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) to\ncirrhosis. This is in the absence of ongo-\ning or recent consumption of signi\ufb01cant\namounts of alcohol (de\ufb01ned as inges-\ntion of >21 standard drinks per week in\nmen and >14 standard drinks per week\nin women over a 2-year period preced-\ning evaluation) or the presence of other\nsecondary causes of fatty liver disease.\nDiabetes is a major risk factor for devel-\noping NASH and for disease progression\nand worse liver outcomes (53). Recent\nstudies in adults in the U.S. estimate\nthat NAFLD is prevalent in >70% of peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes (54\u201356). This is\nconsistent with studies from many other\ncountries (57). NASH is de\ufb01ned histologi-\ncally as having $5% hepatic steatosis\nand associated with in\ufb02ammation and\nhepatocyte injury (hepatocyte balloon-\ning), with or without evidence of liver\n\ufb01brosis (58). Steatohepatitis is estimated\nto affect more than half of people with\ntype 2 diabetes with NAFLD (59), and it\nappears to be a driver for the develop-\nment of \ufb01brosis. Fibrosis stages are clas-\nsi\ufb01ed histologically as the following: F0,\nno \ufb01brosis; F1, mild; F2, moderate (sig-\nni\ufb01cant); F3, severe (advanced); and F4,\ncirrhosis. In the U.S., between 12% and\n20% of people with type 2 diabetes\nhave clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis ($F2)\n(54,55,59), similar to that observed\nworldwide (53,57).

Still, clinicians underestimate\nits prevalence and do not consistently\nimplement appropriate screening strate-\ngies, thus missing the diagnosis of NAFLD\nin high-risk groups, such as those having\nobesity or type 2 diabetes. This pattern\nof underdiagnosis is compounded by\nsparse referral to specialists and inade-\nquate prescription of medications with\nproven ef\ufb01cacy in NASH (63,64).\nThe goal of screening is not to identify\nsteatosis per se (being already highly\nprevalent in this population) but rather\nto use it to identify those on a disease\npath of future cirrhosis. This risk is higher\nin people who have obesity and cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors or insulin resistance,\nare >50 years of age, and/or have persis-\ntently elevated plasma aminotransferases\n(AST and/or ALT >30 units/L for more\n>6 months) (65,66). Some genetic var-\niants that alter hepatocyte triglyceride\nmetabolism may also increase the risk of\nNASH progression and cirrhosis (67,68),\namplifying the impact of obesity, but the\nrole of genetic testing in clinical practice\nremains to be established.\nIndividuals with clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01-\nbrosis ($F2), especially those with type 2\ndiabetes, have a greater risk of cirrhosis\nwith liver decompensation, HCC, liver\ntransplantation, and all-cause mortality\n(69\u201372). Excess mortality associated with\nNAFLD is attributable not only to cirrho-\nsis and HCC but also to extrahepatic\ncancer (61), type 2 diabetes (73), and\ncardiovascular disease (74,75). Their esti-\nmated relative impact depends on length\nof follow-up and population studied,\namong other factors. Emerging evidence\nsuggests that NAFLD increases the risk of\nchronic kidney disease, particularly when\nliver \ufb01brosis is present (76,77), although\nthe association of NAFLD with diabetic\nretinopathy is less clear (78). Therefore,\nearly diagnosis is essential to prevent fu-\nture cirrhosis.\nA recent meta-analysis reported a preva-\nlence of NAFLD of 22% in people with\ntype 1 diabetes (79). This risk may be\nlinked to the fact that about one-third in\nthe U.S. have obesity (80). However, there\nwas a large variability across studies, and\nmost measured liver fat by ultrasound. In\none of the few studies using the gold-\nstandard MRI technique to quantitate\nliver fat, the prevalence of steatosis in\na population with type 1 diabetes with\nlow prevalence of obesity was only 8.8%\ncompared with 68% in people with type 2\ndiabetes (81). The prevalence of \ufb01brosis\nwas not established. Therefore, screening\nfor \ufb01brosis in people with type 1 diabe-\ntes should only be considered in the\npresence of additional risk factors for\nNAFLD, such as obesity, incidental he-\npatic steatosis on imaging, or elevated\nplasma aminotransferases.\nThere is consensus that the \ufb01brosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) is the most cost-effective\nstrategy for the initial screening of peo-\nple with prediabetes and cardiometa-\nbolic risk factors or type 2 diabetes in\nthe primary care and diabetes clinical\nsetting (58,64\u201366,82\u201384). See the pro-\nposed diagnostic algorithm by an expert\ngroup that included ADA representatives\nin Fig. 4.2 (64). A screening strategy\nbased on elevated plasma aminotrans-\nferases >40 units/L would miss most in-\ndividuals with NASH in these settings, as\nclinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis ($F2) is\nfrequently observed with plasma ami-\nnotransferases below the commonly\nused cutoff of 40 units/L (54\u201356,59,\n85,86). The American College of Gastroen-\nterology considers the upper limit of nor-\nmal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for\nmale individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for\nfemale individuals (87), as higher levels\nare associated with increased liver-\nrelated mortality, even in the absence\nof identi\ufb01able risk factors. The FIB-4 esti-\nmates the risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is\ncalculated from the computation of age,\nplasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT),\nand platelet count (mdcalc.com/calc/\n2200/\ufb01brosis-4-\ufb01b-4-index-liver-\ufb01brosis).\nA value of <1.3 is considered lower risk,\nwhile >2.67 is considered as having a\nhigh probability of advanced \ufb01brosis\n(F3\u2013F4). It also predicts changes over\ntime in hepatic \ufb01brosis (88,89) and al-\nlows risk strati\ufb01cation of individuals in\nterms of future liver-related morbidity\nand mortality (90,91). FIB-4 has an area\nunder the receiver\u2013operating character-\nistic curve of only 0.78\u20130.80 (89,92\u2013\n95); thus, a con\ufb01rmatory test is often\nneeded. It has a reasonable speci\ufb01city\nand negative predictive value to rule\nout advanced \ufb01brosis but lacks ade-\nquate sensitivity and positive predic-\ntive value to establish presence of\nadvanced \ufb01brosis in many cases, which\nis the reason why people with diabetes\noften fall in the \u201cindeterminate risk\u201d\ngroup for establishing the advanced\n\ufb01brosis (or intermediate) group (between\n1.3 and 2.67). However, its low cost,\nsimplicity, and good speci\ufb01city make it\nthe initial test of choice (Fig. 4.2).

In people with diabe-\ntes $65 years of age, higher cutoffs\nfor\nFIB-4\nhave\nbeen recommended\n(1.9\u20132.0 rather than >1.3) (96,97).\nIn people with an indeterminate or\nhigh FIB-4, additional risk strati\ufb01cation is\nrequired with a liver stiffness measure-\nment (LSM) by transient elastography\n(Fig. 4.2) or, if unavailable, by commer-\ncial blood \ufb01brosis biomarkers such as\nthe Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test\n(98) or others. Use of a second non-\nproprietary diagnostic panel is not rec-\nommended (i.e., NAFLD \ufb01brosis score,\nothers), as they generally do not perform\nbetter than FIB-4 (56,92). Transient elas-\ntography (LSM) is the best-validated\nimaging technique for \ufb01brosis risk strati-\n\ufb01cation, and it predicts future cirrhosis\nand all-cause mortality in NAFLD (58,65,99).\nAn LSM value of <8.0 kPa has a good\nnegative predictive value to exclude ad-\nvanced \ufb01brosis ($F3\u2013F4) (100\u2013102) and\nindicates low risk for clinically signi\ufb01cant\n\ufb01brosis. Such individuals with diabetes\ncan be followed in nonspecialty clinics\nwith repeat surveillance testing every\n$2 years. If the LSM is >12 kPa, the\nrisk for advanced \ufb01brosis is high and\npeople with diabetes should be referred\nto the hepatologist (100). FIB-4 followed\nby LSM helps stratify people with diabe-\ntes by risk level and minimize referrals\nto the specialist (91,94,99,103,104)\n(Fig. 4.2).\nSpecialists may order additional tests\nfor \ufb01brosis risk strati\ufb01cation (64\u201366,84,\n99), with magnetic resonance elastogra-\nphy having the best overall performance\n(particularly for early \ufb01brosis stages).\nFinally, liver biopsy remains the gold stan-\ndard for the diagnosis of NASH, and its\nindication is reserved to the discretion\nof the specialist within a multidisciplinary\nteam approach.\nThe American Gastroenterological As-\nsociation convened an international con-\nference, including representatives of the\nADA, to review and discuss published\nliterature on the burden, screening, risk\nstrati\ufb01cation, diagnosis, and manage-\nment of individuals with NAFLD (64).\nSee Fig. 4.2, which is reproduced from\nthis special report (64). A Clinical Care\nPathway summarized the diagnosis and\nmanagement of NAFLD in a subsequent\npublication (66). Consensus is emerging\nto start screening with FIB-4 followed by\nLSM and/or patented biomarkers for the\nnoninvasive \ufb01brosis risk strati\ufb01cation of\nindividuals with NAFLD in primary care\nand diabetes clinics (58,64\u201366,82\u201384).\nAfter initial risk strati\ufb01cation (i.e., FIB-4,\nLSM, and/or patented biomarkers), peo-\nple with diabetes at indeterminate or\nhigh risk of \ufb01brosis should be referred,\nbased on practice setting, to a gastroen-\nterologist or hepatologist for further\nworkup within the framework of a mul-\ntidisciplinary team (64,105,106).\nManagement\nWhile steatohepatitis and cirrhosis oc-\ncur in lean people with diabetes and\nare believed to be linked to genetic\npredisposition, insulin resistance, and\nenvironmental factors (107\u2013109), there\nis ample evidence to implicate excess\nadiposity in people with overweight and\nobesity in the pathogenesis of the dis-\nease (110,111). Obesity in the setting of\ntype 2 diabetes worsens insulin resistance\nand steatohepatitis, promoting the de-\nvelopment of cirrhosis (112). Therefore,\nclinicians should recommend lifestyle\nchanges in people with overweight or\nobesity and NAFLD. A minimum weight\nloss\ngoal\nof\n5%,\npreferably\n$10%\n(113,114), is needed to improve liver his-\ntology, with \ufb01brosis requiring the larger\nweight reduction to change (114\u2013116).\nIndividualized, structured weight loss and\nexercise programs offer greater bene\ufb01t\nthan standard counseling in people with\nNAFLD (107,117).\nDietary recommendations to induce\nan energy de\ufb01cit are not different than\nthose for people with diabetes with obe-\nsity without NAFLD and should include a\nreduction of macronutrient content, lim-\niting saturated fat, starch, and added\nsugar, with adoption of healthier eating\npatterns. The Mediterranean diet has the\nbest evidence for improving liver and\ncardiometabolic health (58,65,82,83,117\u2013\n121). Both aerobic and resistance training\nimprove NAFLD in proportion to treat-\nment engagement and intensity of the\nprogram (122\u2013124).\nObesity pharmacotherapy may assist\nwith weight loss in the context of life-\nstyle modi\ufb01cation if not achieved by life-\nstyle modi\ufb01cation alone.\nBariatric surgery improves NASH and\ncardiometabolic health, altering the nat-\nural history of the disease (125). Meta-\nanalyses report that 70\u201380% of people\nhave improvement in hepatic steatosis,\n50\u201375% in in\ufb02ammation and hepato-\ncyte ballooning (necrosis), and 30\u201340%\nin \ufb01brosis (126,127). It may also reduce\nthe risk of HCC (127). Bariatric surgery\nshould be used with caution in individu-\nals with compensated cirrhosis, but in\nexperienced hands the risk of hepatic\ndecompensation is similar to that for\nthose with less advanced liver disease.\nBecause of the paucity of safety and\noutcome data, bariatric surgery is\nnot recommended in individuals with\ndecompensated cirrhosis who also\nhave a much higher risk of postopera-\ntive liver-related complications (enceph-\nalopathy, variceal bleeding, or ascites)\n(58,65,66).\nAt present, there are no FDA-approved\ndrugs for the treatment of NASH. There-\nfore, treatment for people with type 2 di-\nabetes and NASH is centered on the dual\npurpose of treating hyperglycemia and\nobesity, especially if clinically signi\ufb01cant \ufb01-\nbrosis ($F2) is present. The rationale for\nthe treatment of people with type 2 dia-\nbetes is based on their high prevalence\nof NASH with signi\ufb01cant \ufb01brosis (10\u201315%\nof\npeople\nwith\ntype\n2\ndiabetes)\n(54,55,57), their higher risk of disease\nprogression and liver-related mortality\n(53,72,128), and the lack of pharmaco-\nlogical treatments once cirrhosis is\nestablished (129). Therefore, early diag-\nnosis and treatment of NAFLD offers\nthe best opportunity for cirrhosis pre-\nvention. Pioglitazone and some glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1\nRAs) have been shown to be effective\nto treat steatohepatitis (64,65,130\u2013132)\nand may slow \ufb01brosis progression (133\u2013135)\nand decrease cardiovascular disease\n(65,131), which is the number one cause\nof death in people with type 2 diabetes\nand NAFLD (74).\nPioglitazone improves glucose and lipid\nmetabolism and reverses steatohepatitis\nin people with prediabetes, type 2 diabe-\ntes (136,137), or even without diabetes\n(138\u2013140). Fibrosis also improved in some\ntrials (137,139). A meta-analysis (133) con-\ncluded that pioglitazone treatment results\nin resolution of NASH and may improve\n\ufb01brosis. Pioglitazone may halt the accel-\nerated pace of \ufb01brosis progression ob-\nserved in people with type 2 diabetes\n(134) and is overall cost-effective for the\ntreatment of NASH (141,142). Vitamin E\nmay be bene\ufb01cial for the treatment of\nNASH in people without diabetes (138).\nHowever, in people with type 2 diabetes,\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nComprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities\nS59\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "treatment in a small randomized con-\ntrolled trial (RCT) was largely negative as\nmonotherapy (134), and when added to\npioglitazone, it did not seem to enhance\npioglitazone\u2019s ef\ufb01cacy, as reported in an\nearlier trial in this population (137).\nPioglitazone\ncauses\ndose-dependent\nweight gain (15 mg/day, mean of 1\u20132%;\n45 mg/day, 3\u20135%), increases fracture\nrisk, may promote heart failure if used\nin individuals with preexisting conges-\ntive heart failure, and may increase\nthe risk of bladder cancer, although\nthis remains controversial (64,65,131,\n132).\nGLP-1 RAs are effective in inducing\nweight loss and ameliorating elevated\nplasma aminotransferases and steatosis\n(130). However, there are only two RCTs\nin biopsy-proven individuals with NASH.\nA small RCT reported that liraglutide im-\nproved some features of NASH and, of\nparticular relevance, delayed the pro-\ngression of \ufb01brosis (143). More recently,\nonce-daily subcutaneous semaglutide in\n320 people with biopsy-proven NASH\n(62% having type 2 diabetes) reported\nresolution of steatohepatitis in 59% at the\nhigher dose (equivalent to 2.4 mg/week\nsemaglutide) compared with 17% in the\nplacebo group (P < 0.001) (135). Cumu-\nlatively, semaglutide did not signi\ufb01cantly\naffect the stage of liver \ufb01brosis in this\ngroup of people (70% of whom had F2\nor F3 at baseline), but it signi\ufb01cantly\nslowed over 72 weeks the progression\nof liver \ufb01brosis (4.9% with the GLP-1 RA\nat the highest dose compared with 18.8%\non placebo). Tirzepatide (144), sodium\u2013\nglucose cotransporter inhibitors (145\u2013147),\nand insulin (132) reduce hepatic steatosis,\nbut their effects on steatohepatitis remain\nunknown.\nObstructive Sleep Apnea\nAge-adjusted rates of obstructive sleep\napnea, a risk factor for cardiovascular dis-\nease, are signi\ufb01cantly higher (4- to 10-fold)\nwith obesity, especially with central obesity\n(148). The prevalence of obstructive sleep\napnea in the population with type 2 diabe-\ntes may be as high as 23%, and the preva-\nlence of any sleep-disordered breathing\nmay be as high as 58% (149,150). In par-\nticipants with obesity enrolled in the Ac-\ntion for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD)\ntrial, it exceeded 80% (151). Individuals\nwith symptoms suggestive of obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea (e.g., excessive day-\ntime sleepiness, snoring, witnessed apnea)\nshould be considered for screening (152).\nSleep apnea treatment (lifestyle modi\ufb01ca-\ntion, continuous positive airway pressure,\noral appliances, and surgery) signi\ufb01cantly\nimproves quality of life and blood pres-\nsure management. The evidence for a\ntreatment effect on glycemic control is\nmixed (153).\nPeriodontal Disease\nPeriodontal disease is more severe, and\nmay be more prevalent, in people with\ndiabetes than in those without and has\nbeen associated with higher A1C levels\n(154\u2013156). Longitudinal studies suggest\nthat people with periodontal disease\nhave higher rates of incident diabetes.\nCurrent evidence suggests that periodon-\ntal disease adversely affects diabetes out-\ncomes, although evidence for treatment\nbene\ufb01ts remains controversial (29,157). In\nan RCT, intensive periodontal treatment\nwas associated with better glycemic\noutcomes (A1C 8.3% vs. 7.8% in control\nsubjects and the intensive-treatment\ngroup, respectively) and reduction in in-\n\ufb02ammatory markers after 12 months of\nfollow-up (158).\nDIABETES AND COVID-19\nRecommendations\n4.11 Health care professionals should\nhelp people with diabetes aim\nto achieve individualized targeted\nglycemic control to reduce the\nrisk of macrovascular and micro-\nvascular risk as well as reduce\nthe risk of COVID-19 and its\ncomplications. B\n4.12 As we move into the recovery\nphase, diabetes health care\nservices and practitioners should\naddress the impact of the\npandemic in higher-risk groups,\nincluding ethnic minority, de-\nprived, and older populations. B\n4.13 People who have been infected\nwith SARS-CoV-2 should be fol-\nlowed up in the longer term to\nassess for complications and\nsymptoms of long COVID. E\n4.14 People with new-onset diabetes\nneed to be followed up regu-\nlarly in routine clinical practice\nto determine if diabetes is\ntransient.

C\n4.16 People with diabetes and their\nfamilies/caregivers should be\nmonitored for psychological\nwell-being and offered support\nor referrals as needed, includ-\ning mental/behavioral health\ncare, self-management education\nand support, and resources to\naddress related risk factors. E\n4.17 Health care systems need to en-\nsure that the vulnerable popula-\ntions are not disproportionately\ndisadvantaged by use of tech-\nnological methods of consulta-\ntions. E\n4.18 There is no clear indication to\nchange prescribing of glucose-\nlowering therapies in people\nwith diabetes infected by the\nSARS-CoV-2 virus. B\n4.19 People with diabetes should be\nprioritized and offered SARS-\nCoV-2 vaccines. B\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the\nclinical disease COVID-19, was \ufb01rst re-\nported in December 2019 in China and\nhas disproportionately impacted certain\ngroups, including men, older people, eth-\nnic minority populations, and people\nwith certain chronic conditions, including\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney\ndisease, and certain respiratory diseases.\nCOVID-19 has now been recognized as a\ncomplex multisystem disease including\nwidespread insulin resistance, endothe-\nlial dysfunction, hematological disorders,\nand hyperimmune responses (159). There\nis now evidence of not only direct but\nalso indirect adverse effects of COVID-19\nin people with diabetes. Many people\nwith multiple long-term conditions have\ndiabetes, which has also been associated\nwith worse outcomes in people with\nCOVID-19 (160). The association with BMI\nand COVID-19 mortality is U-shaped in\nboth type 1 and type 2 diabetes (161).\nCOVID-19 has disproportionately af-\nfected certain groups, such as older\npeople and those from some ethnic\npopulations who are known to have\nhigh prevalence of chronic conditions\nsuch as diabetes, cardiovascular disease,\nkidney disease, and certain respiratory\ndiseases (162).

    "text": "conditions have experienced some of\nthe worst COVID-19 outcomes, includ-\ning hospital admission and mortality\n(163). In people with diabetes, higher\nblood glucose levels both prior to and\nduring COVID-19 admission have been\nassociated with poor outcomes, includ-\ning mortality (164). Type 1 diabetes has\nbeen associated with higher risk of\nCOVID-19 mortality than type 2 diabe-\ntes (165). One whole-population-level\nstudy of over 61 million people in England\nin the \ufb01rst wave of the pandemic re-\nported that after adjustment for age, sex,\nethnicity, deprivation, and geographical\nregion, the odds ratios for in-hospital\nCOVID-19\u2013related deaths were 3.51\n(95% CI 3.16\u20133.90) in people with\ntype 1 diabetes and 2.03 (1.97\u20132.09)\nin people with type 2 diabetes com-\npared with the general population\n(166). There were also excess deaths\nin the \ufb01rst wave by 59.1% in people\nwith type 1 diabetes and 64.3% in\npeople with type 2 diabetes compared\nwith death rates in the same time pe-\nriod for the previous 3 years (161).\nThe largest study of people with diabe-\ntes to date, using whole-population data\nfrom England with over 3 million peo-\nple, reported a higher association for\nmortality in people with type 1 diabetes\nthan type 2 diabetes (161). Male sex,\nolder age, renal impairment, non-White\nethnicity,\nsocioeconomic\ndeprivation,\nand previous stroke and heart failure\nwere associated with increased COVID-\n19\u2013related mortality in both type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes (161).\nMuch of the evidence for recommen-\ndations is from a recent systematic re-\nview that was commissioned by the\nWorld Health Organization on the latest\nresearch evidence on the impact of\nCOVID-19\non\npeople\nwith\ndiabetes\n(165). Data were summarized from 112\nsystematic reviews that were narratively\nsynthesized. The review reported that\nthere are no appropriate data to deter-\nmine whether diabetes is a risk factor\nfor acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dia-\nbetes is a risk factor for severe disease\nand death from COVID-19.\nReasons for the higher rates of\nCOVID-19 and severity in minority ethnic\ngroups are complex and could be due to\nhigher prevalence of comorbid conditions\n(e.g., diabetes), differences in exposure\nrisk (e.g., overcrowded living conditions,\nessential worker jobs), and access to\ntreatment (e.g., health insurance status,\nspecialist services, and medications), which\nall relate to long-standing structural in-\nequities that vary by ethnicity (167).\nThere is now overwhelming evidence\nthat approximately 30\u201340% of people\nwho are infected with COVID-19 get per-\nsistent and sometimes relapsing and re-\nmitting symptoms 4 weeks after infection,\nwhich has been termed post-acute\nsequelae of COVID-19, post-COVID-19\ncondition,\npost-acute\nCOVID-19\nsyn-\ndrome, or long COVID (168,169). Cur-\nrently, data on long COVID speci\ufb01cally\nin people with diabetes are lacking,\nand people who have been infected\nwith SARS-CoV-2 should be followed up\nin the longer term.\nThere have also been recent reports\nof development of new-onset diabetes\nin people who have had COVID-19. There\nare con\ufb02icting reports of new-onset dia-\nbetes, with publications from a number\nof countries. The precise mechanisms\nfor new-onset diabetes in people with\nCOVID-19 are not known but may in-\nclude previously undiagnosed diabetes\npresenting early or later in the disease\ntrajectory, stress hyperglycemia, steroid-\ninduced hyperglycemia, and possibly di-\nrect or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on\nthe b-cell (170). Whether new-onset di-\nabetes is likely to remain permanent or\nis more aggressive is not known, and it\nwill be important for health care profes-\nsionals to monitor these people in the\nlonger term. One large U.S. retrospective\nstudy of over 27 million people reported\nthat COVID-19 was associated with sig-\nni\ufb01cantly increased risk of new-onset\ntype 1 diabetes and a disproportionately\nhigher risk in ethnic minority people\n(171). Another recent cross-sectional\npopulation\u2013based Canadian study ob-\nserved a slightly higher but nonsigni\ufb01-\ncant increase in diabetes incidence in\nchildren during the pandemic, suggesting\nthis resulted from delays in diagnosis\nearly during the pandemic with a catch-\nup effect (172). Whether COVID-19 leads\nto new-onset diabetes is not known.\nThere have been several publications\non the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)\nduring the pandemic. A German diabetes\nprospective study using registry data\nof children and adolescents found an\nincrease in type 1 diabetes in the \ufb01rst\n3 months of the \ufb01rst wave, and the fre-\nquency of DKA at presentation was sig-\nni\ufb01cantly higher than those for 2019\n(44.7% vs. 24.5%, adjusted risk ratio\n1.84) and 2018 (vs. 24.1%, adjusted\nrisk ratio 1.85) as well as the propor-\ntion with severe DKA (173). A larger\nstudy using national data in England\nduring the \ufb01rst two waves found that\nrates of DKA were higher than those for\npreceding years across all pandemic pe-\nriods studied (174). The study reported\nlower DKA hospital admissions in people\nwith type 1 diabetes but higher rates of\nDKA in people with type 1 diabetes and\nthose newly diagnosed with diabetes.\nThere is also evidence of adverse ef-\nfects of COVID-19 on mental health (175)\nand health-promoting lifestyles during the\npandemic. Some small studies in people\nwith diabetes have reported longer-term\npsychological impact of SARS-CoV-2 in-\nfection in people with diabetes, including\nfatigue and risk of suicide (176). Longitu-\ndinal follow-up of the Look AHEAD study\nof older adults with type 2 diabetes re-\nported a 1.6-fold higher prevalence for\ndepressive symptoms and 1.8-fold higher\nprevalence for loneliness during the\npandemic compared with prepandemic\nlevels (177). Furthermore, people with\ndiabetes remain fearful of attending face-\nto-face contact due to the possible\nthreat from mutant strains of corona-\nvirus (178). Negative emotions due to\nthe pandemic, including lockdowns, have\nbeen associated with reduced motiva-\ntion, physical inactivity, and sedentary\nbehavior (179). Higher levels of pandemic-\nrelated distress have been linked to higher\nA1C (180). Greater pandemic-related life\ndisruptions have been related to higher\ndistress in parents of youth with diabe-\ntes, which may have impacted families\nfrom racial and ethnic minority groups\nto a greater degree than non-Hispanic\nWhite families (181). On the other hand,\nfor some youth with type 1 diabetes,\nincreased time at home during the early\nphases of the COVID-19 pandemic pro-\nvided opportunities for enhanced family\nsupport for diabetes self-management\nand reduced diabetes-related distress\n(182).\nRecurrent lockdowns and other public\nhealth measures due to the pandemic\nhave restricted access to routine diabetes\ncare and have affected self-management,\ncare-seeking behavior, and access to\nmedications (183). This has resulted in\ncompromised routine care and manage-\nment of risk factors (184,185).

    "text": "type 2 diabetes and reductions in new\nprescriptions of metformin during the\npandemic (186). Due to unemployment\nor lost income during the pandemic,\npeople living with diabetes have expe-\nrienced \ufb01nancial hardships that may\nhave reduced their affordability for medi-\ncations in countries where costs for medi-\ncations are out of pocket (184). Many\nindividuals with diabetes have avoided\nor delayed seeking medical attention\nfor routine non-COVID-19\u2013related prob-\nlems due to fear of infection and/or to\nreduce strain on health care services\n(187). Disruptions in care delivery and\ncompletion of care processes have been\nassociated with an increased risk of non-\nCOVID-19\u2013related deaths in people with\ndiabetes (188).\nDirect contact will still be necessary if\nblood tests or physical examinations are\nrequired. However, it will be important\nto ensure that disparities are not wid-\nened for vulnerable groups such as the\nelderly and socieconomically challenged\nand ethnic minority groups due to ac-\ncess to literacy.\nAs we recover from the pandemic, it\nis essential that we prioritize the highest-\nrisk groups for their routine review and\nassessment as well as management of\ntheir mental/behavioral health and risk\nfactors. Diabetes professional bodies in\nsome countries have published guidance\non risk strati\ufb01cation and who to prioritize\nfor diabetes review (189,190). Factors to\nconsider for prioritization should include\ndemographics, socioeconomical status,\neducation levels, established complica-\ntions, comorbidities, and modi\ufb01able risk\nfactors, which are associated with high\nrisk of progression of diabetes-related\ncomplications.\nIn many countries, health care profes-\nsionals have reduced face-to-face contact\nand adapted technological methods of de-\nlivering routine diabetes care. One small\nRCT in adults with type 2 diabetes with\nfollow-up to 16 weeks showed that remote\nconsultations during the pandemic re-\nduced the prevalence of mental health-\nand diabetes-related emotional distress\n(191). The number of face-to-face ap-\npointments is now increasing, and hybrid\nmodels with both virtual and face-to-\nface consultations are likely to remain\n(192). Technological interventions such\nas telehealth in people with diabetes\nmay be a solution to improve care\nand clinical outcomes (193). However,\nsuch technological interventions may fur-\nther widen disparities in vulnerable popu-\nlations such as the elderly, ethnic minority\ngroups, frail populations, and those\nfrom deprived communities (194).\nSeveral pharmacoepidemiological stud-\nies have examined the association be-\ntween glucose-lowering medications and\nrisk of COVID-19 and have reported con-\n\ufb02icting \ufb01ndings, although most studies\nshowed a lower risk of mortality with\nmetformin and a higher risk in people\non insulin. However, the absolute differ-\nences in the risks have been small, and\nthese \ufb01ndings could be due to con-\nfounding by indication (195). The gold\nstandard for assessing the effects of\ntherapies is by RCT, and only one RCT,\nthe Dapagli\ufb02ozin in Patients with Cardio-\nmetabolic Risk Factors Hospitalized with\nCOVID-19 (DARE-19), a double-blind, pla-\ncebo-controlled RCT in people with and\nwithout type 2 diabetes with at least\none cardiovascular risk factor, has been\nreported (196). In this study, dapagli\ufb02o-\nzin was well tolerated and resulted in\nfewer events of organ dysfunction, but\nresults were not statistically signi\ufb01cant\nfor the dual primary outcome of preven-\ntion (time to new or worsening organ\ndysfunction or death) and the hierar-\nchical composite outcome of recovery\nby 30 days.\nGreat progress has been made glob-\nally to develop vaccines against SARS-\nCoV-2, and RCT data and real-world data\nshow that vaccines have led to reduced\ninfections, transmission, hospitalization,\nand mortality. It is therefore important\nthat people with diabetes have regular\nSARS-CoV-2 vaccines (see IMMUNIZATIONS,\nabove,\nfor\ndetailed\ninformation\non\nCOVID-19 vaccines).\nIt is unclear currently how often people\nwith diabetes will require booster vac-\ncines. Though limited data are available\non COVID-19 vaccination attitudes or up-\ntake in people with diabetes in the U.S.\n(197), diabetes health care professionals\nmay be in a position to address ques-\ntions and concerns among people with\ndiabetes and encourage vaccination.\nReferences\n1.

C\nThe overall objectives of diabetes self-\nmanagement education and support\n(DSMES) are to support informed decision-\nmaking, self-care behaviors, problem-\nsolving, and active collaboration with the\nhealth care team to improve clinical out-\ncomes, health status, and well-being in a\ncost-effective manner (2). DSMES services\nfacilitate the knowledge, decision-making,\nand skills mastery necessary for optimal\ndiabetes self-care and incorporate the\nneeds, goals, and life experiences of the\nperson with diabetes. Health care profes-\nsionals are encouraged to consider the\nburden of treatment (9) and the person\u2019s\nlevel of con\ufb01dence and self-ef\ufb01cacy for\nmanagement behaviors as well as the\nlevel of social and family support when\nproviding DSMES. An individual\u2019s engage-\nment in self-management behaviors and\nthe effects on clinical outcomes, health\nstatus, and quality of life, as well as the\npsychosocial factors impacting the per-\nson\u2019s ability to self-manage, should be\nmonitored as part of routine clinical\ncare. A randomized controlled trial (RCT)\ntesting a decision-making education and\nskill-building program (10) showed that\naddressing these targets improved health\noutcomes in a population in need of\nhealth care resources. Furthermore, fol-\nlowing a DSMES curriculum improves\nquality of care (11).\nAdditionally, in response to the grow-\ning body of evidence that associates po-\ntentially judgmental words with increased\nfeelings of shame and guilt, health care\nprofessionals are encouraged to consider\nthe impact that language has on building\ntherapeutic relationships and to choose\npositive, strength-based words and phrases\nthat put people \ufb01rst (4,12). Please see Sec-\ntion 4, \u201cComprehensive Medical Evaluation\nand Assessment of Comorbidities,\u201d for\nmore on use of language.\nIn accordance with the national\nstandards for DSMES (13), all people\nwith diabetes should participate in\nDSMES as it helps people with diabetes\nto identify and implement effective self-\nmanagement strategies and cope with di-\nabetes (2). Ongoing DSMES helps people\nwith diabetes to maintain effective self-\nmanagement throughout the life course\nas they encounter new challenges and as\nadvances in treatment become available\n(14).\nThere are four critical time points\nwhen the need for DSMES should be\nevaluated by the health care profes-\nsional and/or multidisciplinary team,\nwith referrals made as needed (2):\n1. At diagnosis\n2. Annually and/or when not meeting\ntreatment targets\n3. When complicating factors (health\nconditions, physical limitations, emo-\ntional factors, or basic living needs) de-\nvelop that in\ufb02uence self-management\n4. When transitions in life and care\noccur\nDSMES focuses on empowering indi-\nviduals with diabetes by providing people\nwith diabetes the tools to make informed\nself-management decisions (15). DSMES\nshould be person-centered. This is an\napproach that places the person with dia-\nbetes and their family and/or support\nsystem at the center of the care model,\nworking in collaboration with health care\nprofessionals. Person-centered care is re-\nspectful of and responsive to individual\npreferences, needs, and values. It ensures\nthat the values of the person with diabetes\nguide all decision-making (16).\nEvidence for the Benefits\nDSMES is associated with improved dia-\nbetes knowledge and self-care behav-\niors (17), lower A1C (17\u201321), lower self-\nreported weight (22), improved quality of\nlife (19,23,24), reduced all-cause mortal-\nity risk (25), positive coping behaviors\n(5,26), and reduced health care costs\n(27\u201329). DSMES is associated with an in-\ncreased use of primary care and preven-\ntive services (27,30,31) and less frequent\nuse of acute care and inpatient hospital\nservices (22). People with diabetes who\nparticipate in DSMES are more likely to\nfollow best practice treatment recom-\nmendations, particularly those with\nMedicare, and have lower Medicare and\ninsurance claim costs (28,31). Better out-\ncomes were reported for DSMES inter-\nventions that were more than 10 h over\nthe course of 6\u201312 months (20), included\nongoing support (14,32), were culturally\n(33\u201335) and age appropriate (36,37),\nwere tailored to individual needs and\npreferences, addressed psychosocial is-\nsues, and incorporated behavioral strat-\negies (15,26,38,39). Individual and group\napproaches are effective (40\u201342), with a\nslight bene\ufb01t realized by those who en-\ngage in both (20). Strong evidence now\nexists on the bene\ufb01ts of virtual, telehealth,\nor internet-based DSMES services for dia-\nbetes prevention and management in a\nwide variety of populations (43\u201354).\nTechnologies such as mobile apps, sim-\nulation tools, digital coaching, and digital\nself-management interventions can also\nbe used to deliver DSMES (55\u201360). These\nmethods provide comparable or even im-\nproved outcomes compared with tra-\nditional in-person care (61).

Continuous glucose monitoring,\nwhen combined with individualized diabe-\ntes education or behavioral interventions,\nhas demonstrated greater improvement\non glycemic and psychosocial outcomes\ncompared with continuous glucose moni-\ntoring alone (63,64). Incorporating a\nsystematic approach for technology\nassessment, adoption, and integration\ninto the care plan may help ensure eq-\nuity in access and standardized appli-\ncation of technology-enabled solutions (8,\n30,65\u201367).\nResearch supports diabetes care and\neducation specialists (DCES), including\nnurses, registered dietitian nutritionists\n(RDNs), and pharmacists as providers of\nDSMES who may also tailor curriculum\nto the person\u2019s needs (68\u201370). Many\nother health disciplines can also become\nDCES. Members of the DSMES team\nshould have specialized clinical knowl-\nedge in diabetes and behavior change\nprinciples. In addition, a DCES needs to\nbe knowledgeable about technology-\nenabled services and may serve as a tech-\nnology champion within their practice\n(65). Certi\ufb01cation as a DCES (cbdce.org/)\nand/or board certi\ufb01cation in advanced di-\nabetes management (diabeteseducator.\norg/education/certi\ufb01cation/bc_adm)\ndemonstrates an individual\u2019s specialized\ntraining in and understanding of diabetes\nmanagement and support (43), and en-\ngagement with quali\ufb01ed professionals has\nbeen shown to improve disease-related\noutcomes. Additionally, there is growing\nevidence for the role of community health\nworkers (71,72), as well as peer (71\u201376)\nand lay leaders (77), in providing ongoing\nsupport.\nGiven individual needs and access to\nresources, a variety of culturally adapted\nDSMES programs need to be offered in a\nvariety of settings. The use of technology\nto facilitate access to DSMES services,\nsupport self-management decisions, and\ndecrease therapeutic inertia suggests\nthat these approaches need broader\nadoption (78). Additionally, it is important\nto include social determinants of health\n(SDOH) of the target population in guid-\ning design and delivery of DSMES. The\nDSMES team should take into account\ndemographic characteristics such as race,\nethnic/cultural background, sex/gender,\nage, geographic location, technology ac-\ncess, education, literacy, and numeracy\n(43,79).\nDespite the bene\ufb01ts of DSMES, reports\nindicate that only 5\u20137% of individuals eli-\ngible for DSMES through Medicare or a\nprivate insurance plan actually receive it\n(80,81). Barriers to DSMES exist at the\nhealth system, payer, health care profes-\nsional, and individual levels. This low par-\nticipation may be due to lack of referral\nor other identi\ufb01ed barriers, such as logis-\ntical issues (accessibility, timing, costs)\nand the lack of a perceived bene\ufb01t (81).\nHealth system, programmatic, and payer\nbarriers include lack of administrative\nleadership support, limited numbers of\nDSMES professionals, not having referral\nto DSMES services effectively embedded\nin the health system service structure,\nand limited reimbursement rates (82).\nThus, in addition to educating referring\nhealth care professionals about the ben-\ne\ufb01ts of DSMES and the critical times to\nrefer, efforts need to be made to identify\nand address all of the various potential\nbarriers (2). Support from institutional\nleadership is foundational for the success\nof DSMES services. Expert stakeholders\nshould also support DSMES by providing\ninput and advocacy (43). Alternative and\ninnovative models of DSMES delivery\n(56) need to be explored and evaluated,\nincluding the integration of technology-\nenabled diabetes and cardiometabolic\nhealth services (8,65). Barriers to equita-\nble access to DSMES may be addressed\nthrough telehealth delivery of care and\nother digital health solutions (43).\nReimbursement\nMedicare reimburses DSMES when\nthat service meets the national stand-\nards (2,43) and is recognized by the\nAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA)\nthrough the Education Recognition\nProgram\n(professional.diabetes.org/\ndiabetes-education) or Association of\nDiabetes Care & Education Specialists\n(diabeteseducator.org/practice/diabetes-\neducation-accreditation-program). DSMES\nis also covered by most health insurance\nplans. Ongoing support has been shown\nto be instrumental for improving out-\ncomes when it is implemented after the\ncompletion of education services. DSMES\nis frequently reimbursed when performed\nin person. However, although DSMES can\nalso be provided via phone calls and tele-\nhealth, these remote versions may not\nalways be reimbursed (13). Medicare re-\nimburses remote physiologic monitoring\nfor glucose and other cardiometabolic\ndata if certain conditions are met (83).\nChanges in reimbursement policies that\nincrease DSMES access and utilization will\nresult in a positive impact to bene\ufb01ciaries\u2019\nclinical outcomes, quality of life, health\ncare utilization, and costs (13,84\u201386). Dur-\ning the time of the coronavirus disease\n2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reimburse-\nment policies were revised (professional.\ndiabetes.org/content-page/dsmes-and-\nmnt-during-covid-19-national-pandemic),\nand these changes may provide a new re-\nimbursement paradigm for future provision\nof DSMES through telehealth channels.\nMEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY\nPlease refer to the ADA consensus report\n\u201cNutrition Therapy for Adults With Dia-\nbetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Re-\nport\u201d for more information on nutrition\ntherapy (70).

To support weight\nloss and improve A1C, cardiovascular dis-\nease (CVD) risk factors, and well-being in\nadults with overweight/obesity and pre-\ndiabetes or diabetes, MNT and DSMES\nservices should include an individualized\neating plan in a format that results in\nan energy de\ufb01cit in combination with en-\nhanced physical activity (70). Lifestyle in-\ntervention programs should be intensive\nand have frequent follow-up to achieve\nsigni\ufb01cant reductions in excess body\nweight and improve clinical indicators.\nThere is strong and consistent evidence\nthat modest, sustained weight loss can\ndelay the progression from prediabetes\nto type 2 diabetes (97\u201399) (see Section 3,\n\u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes\nand Associated Comorbidities\u201d) and is\nbene\ufb01cial for the management of type 2\ndiabetes (see Section 8, \u201cObesity and\nWeight Management for the Prevention\nand Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d).\nIn prediabetes, the weight loss goal is\n7\u201310% for preventing progression to\ntype 2 diabetes (100). In conjunction\nwith support for healthy lifestyle behav-\niors, medication-assisted weight loss can\nbe considered for people at risk for type 2\ndiabetes when needed to achieve and\nsustain 7\u201310% weight loss (101,102) (see\nSection 8, \u201cObesity and Weight Manage-\nment for the Prevention and Treatment of\nType 2 Diabetes\u201d). People with prediabe-\ntes at a healthy weight should also be\nconsidered for behavioral interventions to\nhelp establish routine aerobic and resis-\ntance exercise (100,103,104) as well as to\nestablish healthy eating patterns. Services\ndelivered by practitioners familiar with dia-\nbetes and its management, such as an\nRDN, have been found to be effective (95).\nFor many individuals with overweight\nand obesity with type 2 diabetes, 5%\nweight loss is needed to achieve bene\ufb01-\ncial outcomes in glycemic control, lipids,\nand blood pressure (105). It should be\nnoted, however, that the clinical bene-\n\ufb01ts of weight loss are progressive, and\nmore intensive weight loss goals (i.e.,\n15%) may be appropriate to maximize\nbene\ufb01t depending on need, feasibility,\nand safety (106,107). Long-term durabil-\nity of weight loss remains a challenge;\nhowever, newer medications (beyond\nmetabolic surgery) may have potential\nfor sustainability, impact on cardiovas-\ncular outcomes, and weight reduction\nbeyond 10\u201315% (108\u2013111).\nIn select individuals with type 2 diabe-\ntes, an overall healthy eating plan that\nresults in energy de\ufb01cit in conjunction\nwith weight loss medications and/or\nmetabolic surgery should be considered\nto help achieve weight loss and mainte-\nnance goals, lower A1C, and reduce CVD\nrisk (101,112,113). Overweight and obe-\nsity are also increasingly prevalent in\npeople with type 1 diabetes and pre-\nsent clinical challenges regarding diabetes\ntreatment and CVD risk factors (114,115).\nSustaining weight loss can be challenging\n(105,116) but has long-term bene\ufb01ts;\nmaintaining weight loss for 5 years is\nassociated with sustained improvements\nin A1C and lipid levels (117). MNT guid-\nance from an RDN with expertise in\ndiabetes and weight management through-\nout the course of a structured weight\nloss plan is strongly recommended.\nAlong with routine medical manage-\nment visits, people with diabetes and\nprediabetes should be screened during\nDSMES and MNT encounters for a history\nof dieting and past or current disordered\neating behaviors. Nutrition therapy should\nbe individualized to help address mal-\nadaptive eating behavior (e.g., purging)\nor compensatory changes in medical\ntreatment plan (e.g., overtreatment of hy-\npoglycemic episodes, reduction in medi-\ncation dosing to reduce hunger) (70) (see\nDISORDERED\nEATING\nBEHAVIOR, below). Disor-\ndered eating, eating disorders, and/or dis-\nrupted eating can increase challenges for\nweight and diabetes management. For\nexample, caloric restriction may be es-\nsential for glycemic management and\nweight maintenance, but rigid meal plans\nmay be contraindicated for individuals\nwho are at increased risk of clinically sig-\nni\ufb01cant maladaptive eating behaviors\n(118). If eating disorders are identi\ufb01ed\nduring screening with diabetes-speci\ufb01c\nquestionnaires, individuals should be re-\nferred to a quali\ufb01ed mental health pro-\nfessional (1).\nStudies have demonstrated that a vari-\nety of eating plans, varying in macronutri-\nent composition, can be used effectively\nand safely in the short term (1\u20132 years)\nto achieve weight loss in people with di-\nabetes. These plans include structured\nlow-calorie meal plans with meal re-\nplacements (106,117,119), a Mediterra-\nnean eating pattern (120), and low-\ncarbohydrate meal plans with additional\nsupport (121,122). However, no single\napproach has been proven to be consis-\ntently superior (70,123\u2013125), and more\ndata are needed to identify and validate\nthose meal plans that are optimal with\nrespect to long-term outcomes and ac-\nceptability.

A\n5.11 Because diabetes medical nutrition therapy can result in cost savings B and improved\ncardiometabolic outcomes A, medical nutrition therapy should be adequately reimbursed\nby insurance and other payers. E\nEnergy balance\n5.12 For all people with overweight or obesity, behavioral modi\ufb01cation to achieve and\nmaintain a minimum weight loss of 5% is recommended. A\nEating patterns and macronutrient distribution\n5.13 There is no ideal macronutrient pattern for people with diabetes; meal plans should be\nindividualized while keeping nutrient quality, total calorie, and metabolic goals in mind. E\n5.14 A variety of eating patterns can be considered for the management of type 2 diabetes\nand to prevent diabetes in individuals with prediabetes. B\n5.15 Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated\nthe most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied to a variety of eating\npatterns that meet individual needs and preferences. B\nCarbohydrates\n5.16 Carbohydrate intake should emphasize nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources that are\nhigh in \ufb01ber (at least 14 g \ufb01ber per 1,000 kcal) and minimally processed. Eating plans\nshould emphasize nonstarchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, as well as\ndairy products, with minimal added sugars. B\n5.17 People with diabetes and those at risk are advised to replace sugar-sweetened beverages\n(including fruit juices) with water or low calorie, no calorie beverages as much as\npossible to manage glycemia and reduce risk for cardiometabolic disease B and minimize\nconsumption of foods with added sugar that have the capacity to displace healthier,\nmore nutrient-dense food choices. A\n5.18 When using a \ufb02exible insulin therapy program, education on the glycemic impact of\ncarbohydrate A, fat, and protein B should be tailored to an individual\u2019s needs and\npreferences and used to optimize mealtime insulin dosing.\n5.19 When using \ufb01xed insulin doses, individuals should be provided with education about\nconsistent patterns of carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount while\nconsidering the insulin action time, as it can result in improved glycemia and reduce\nthe risk for hypoglycemia. B\nProtein\n5.20 In individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin\nresponse without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate\nsources high in protein should be avoided when trying to treat or prevent\nhypoglycemia. B\nDietary fat\n5.21 An eating plan emphasizing elements of a Mediterranean eating pattern rich in\nmonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats may be considered to improve glucose\nmetabolism and lower cardiovascular disease risk. B\n5.22 Eating foods rich in long-chain n-3 fatty acids, such as fatty \ufb01sh (EPA and DHA) and\nnuts and seeds (ALA), is recommended to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. B\nMicronutrients and herbal supplements\n5.23 There is no clear evidence that dietary supplementation with vitamins, minerals (such\nas chromium and vitamin D), herbs, or spices (such as cinnamon or aloe vera) can\nimprove outcomes in people with diabetes who do not have underlying de\ufb01ciencies,\nand they are not generally recommended for glycemic control. C There may be\nevidence of harm for certain individuals with b carotene supplementation. B\nAlcohol\n5.24 Adults with diabetes who drink alcohol should do so in moderation (no more than one\ndrink per day for adult women and no more than two drinks per day for adult men). C\n5.25 Educating people with diabetes about the signs, symptoms, and self-management of\ndelayed hypoglycemia after drinking alcohol, especially when using insulin or insulin\nsecretagogues, is recommended. The importance of glucose monitoring after drinking\nalcoholic beverages to reduce hypoglycemia risk should be emphasized. B\nSodium\n5.26 Sodium consumption should be limited to <2,300 mg/day. B\nNonnutritive sweeteners\n5.27 The use of nonnutritive sweeteners as a replacement for sugar-sweetened products\nmay reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake as long as there is not a\ncompensatory increase in energy intake from other sources. There is evidence that\nlow- and no-calorie sweetened beverages are a viable alternative to water.

Any ap-\nproach to meal planning should be indi-\nvidualized, considering the health status,\npersonal preferences, and ability of the\nperson with diabetes to sustain the rec-\nommendations in the plan.\nEating Patterns and Meal Planning\nEvidence suggests that there is not an\nideal percentage of calories from carbo-\nhydrate, protein, and fat for people\nwith diabetes. Therefore, macronutrient\ndistribution should be based on an indi-\nvidualized assessment of current eating\npatterns, preferences, and metabolic\ngoals. Dietary guidance should empha-\nsize the importance of a healthy dietary\npattern as a whole rather than focusing\non individual nutrients, foods, or food\ngroups, given that individuals rarely eat\nfoods in isolation. Personal preferences\n(e.g., tradition, culture, religion, health\nbeliefs and goals, economics), as well as\nmetabolic goals, need to be considered\nwhen working with individuals to deter-\nmine the best eating pattern (70,97,130).\nMembers of the health care team should\ncomplement MNT by providing evidence-\nbased guidance that helps people with di-\nabetes make healthy food choices that\nmeet their individualized needs and\nimprove overall health. A variety of eat-\ning patterns are acceptable for the man-\nagement of diabetes (70,97,131,132).\nHealth care professionals should focus\non the core dimensions common among\nthe patterns: 1) emphasize nonstarchy\nvegetables, 2) minimize added sugars\nand re\ufb01ned grains, and 3) choose whole\nfoods over highly processed foods to\nthe extent possible (70). An individual-\nized eating pattern also considers the\nindividual\u2019s health status, food and nu-\nmeracy skills, resources, food preferen-\nces, health goals, and food access. Any\nmember of the health care team can\nscreen for food insecurity using The Hun-\nger Vital Sign. Households are considered\nat risk if they answer either or both of\nthe following statements as \u201coften true\u201d\nor \u201csometimes true\u201d (compared with\n\u201cnever true\u201d) (133):\n\u2022 \u201cWithin the past 12 months, we wor-\nried whether our food would run out\nbefore we got money to buy more.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWithin the past 12 months, the\nfood we bought just didn\u2019t last, and\nwe didn\u2019t have money to get more.\u201d\nReferral to an RDN is essential to as-\nsess the overall nutrition status of, and\nto work collaboratively with, the person\nwith diabetes to create a personalized\nmeal plan that coordinates and aligns\nwith the overall treatment plan, includ-\ning physical activity and medication use.\nThe Mediterranean (130,134\u2013136), low-\ncarbohydrate (137\u2013139), and vegetarian\nor plant-based (135,136,140,141) eating\npatterns are all examples of healthful eat-\ning patterns that have shown positive re-\nsults in research for individuals with type 2\ndiabetes, but individualized meal plan-\nning should focus on personal preferen-\nces, needs, and goals. There is currently\ninadequate research in type 1 diabetes\nto support one eating pattern over an-\nother. Moreover, there is a paucity of evi-\ndence and agreement as it relates to\nnutrition management among children\nand adolescents with type 1 diabetes.\nThere remains a signi\ufb01cant gap in the\nliterature as it relates to the ef\ufb01cacy\nand long-term management implications\nof nutrition interventions for young chil-\ndren with type 1 diabetes (142).\nFor individuals with type 2 diabetes\nnot meeting glycemic targets or for\nwhom reducing glucose-lowering drugs\nis a priority, reducing overall carbohy-\ndrate intake with a low- or very-\nlow-carbohydrate eating pattern is a vi-\nable option (137\u2013139). As research stud-\nies on low-carbohydrate eating plans\ngenerally indicate challenges with long-\nterm sustainability (143), it is important\nto reassess and individualize meal plan\nguidance regularly for those interested in\nthis approach. In response to questions\nregarding implementation of low-carbohy-\ndrate and very-low-carbohydrate eating\npatterns, the ADA has developed a guide\nfor health care professionals that may as-\nsist in the practical implementation of\nthese eating patterns (144). Most individ-\nuals with diabetes report a moderate in-\ntake of carbohydrates (44\u201346% of total\ncalories) (97,144). Efforts to modify habit-\nual eating patterns are often unsuccessful\nin the long term; people generally go\nback to their usual macronutrient distri-\nbution (97). Thus, the recommended ap-\nproach is to individualize meal plans with\na macronutrient distribution that is more\nconsistent with personal preference and\nusual intake to increase the likelihood for\nlong-term maintenance.\nAn RCT found that two meal-planning\napproaches (diabetes plate method and\ncarbohydrate counting) were effective\nin helping achieve improved A1C (145).\nThe diabetes plate method is a com-\nmonly used visual approach for provid-\ning basic meal planning guidance. This\nsimple graphic (featuring a 9-inch plate)\nshows how to portion foods (1/2 of the\nplate for nonstarchy vegetables, 1/4 of\nthe plate for protein, and 1/4 of the\nplate for carbohydrates). Carbohydrate\ncounting is a more advanced skill that\nhelps plan for and track how much carbo-\nhydrate is consumed at meals and snacks.\nMeal planning approaches should be\ncustomized to the individual, including\ntheir numeracy (145) and food literacy\nlevel. Food literacy generally describes\npro\ufb01ciency in food-related knowledge and\nskills that ultimately impact health, al-\nthough speci\ufb01c de\ufb01nitions vary across\ninitiatives (146,147).\nThere has been an increased interest\nin time-restricted eating and intermittent\nfasting as strategies for weight manage-\nment. Intermittent fasting is an umbrella\nterm which includes three main forms of\nrestricted eating: alternate-day fasting\n(energy restriction of 500\u2013600 calories\non alternate days), the 5:2 diet (energy\nrestriction of 500\u2013600 calories on con-\nsecutive or nonconsecutive days) with\nusual intake the other \ufb01ve, and time-\nrestricted eating (daily calorie restriction\nbased on window of time of 8\u201315 h).\nEach produces mild to moderate weight\nloss (3\u20138% loss from baseline) over short\ndurations (8\u201312 weeks) with no signi\ufb01-\ncant differences in weight loss when com-\npared with continuous calorie restriction\n(148\u2013151). A few studies have extended\nup to 52 weeks and show similar \ufb01nd-\nings (152\u2013155). Time-restricted eating\n(shortening the eating window) is gen-\nerally easier to follow compared with al-\nternative-day fasting or the 5:2 plan,\nlargely due to ease, no need to count\ncalories, sustainability, and feasibility.\nThis may have implications as people\nwith diabetes are looking for practical\neating management tools.\nCarbohydrates\nStudies examining the ideal amount\nof carbohydrate intake for people with\ndiabetes are inconclusive, although\nmonitoring carbohydrate intake and con-\nsidering the blood glucose response to\ndietary carbohydrate are key for improv-\ning postprandial glucose management\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nS73\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The literature concerning gly-\ncemic index and glycemic load in indi-\nviduals with diabetes is complex, often\nwith varying de\ufb01nitions of low- and high-\nglycemic-index foods (158,159). The gly-\ncemic index ranks carbohydrate foods on\ntheir postprandial glycemic response, and\nglycemic load takes into account both\nthe glycemic index of foods and the\namount of carbohydrate eaten. Studies\nhave found mixed results regarding the\neffect of glycemic index and glycemic\nload on fasting glucose levels and A1C,\nwith one systematic review \ufb01nding no\nsigni\ufb01cant impact on A1C (160) while\nothers demonstrated A1C reductions of\n0.15% (158) to 0.5% (161,162).\nReducing overall carbohydrate intake\nfor individuals with diabetes has demon-\nstrated evidence for improving glycemia\nand may be applied in a variety of eating\npatterns that meet individual needs and\npreferences (70). For people with type 2\ndiabetes,\nlow-carbohydrate\nand\nvery-\nlow-carbohydrate eating patterns in par-\nticular have been found to reduce A1C\nand the need for antihyperglycemic med-\nications (70,130,143,163\u2013165). System-\natic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs\nfound carbohydrate-restricted eating pat-\nterns, particularly those considered low\ncarbohydrate (<26% total energy), were\neffective in reducing A1C in the short\nterm (<6 months), with less difference in\neating patterns beyond 1 year (125,126,\n137,138,164). Questions still remain about\nthe optimal degree of carbohydrate re-\nstriction and the long-term effects of\nthose meal patterns on cardiovascular\ndisease. A systematic review and meta-\nanalysis of RCTs investigating the dose-\ndependent effect of carbohydrate re-\nstriction on metabolic control found\neach 10% decrease in carbohydrate in-\ntake had reductions in levels of A1C, fast-\ning plasma glucose, body weight, lipids,\nand systolic blood pressure at 6 months,\nbut favorable effects diminished and\nwere not maintained at follow-up or at\ngreater than 12 months. This systematic\nreview highlights the metabolic complex-\nity of response to dietary intervention in\ntype 2 diabetes as well as the need to\nbetter understand longer-term sustain-\nability and results (166). Part of the chal-\nlenge in interpreting low-carbohydrate\nresearch has been due to the wide range\nof de\ufb01nitions for a low-carbohydrate eat-\ning plan (139,161). Weight reduction was\nalso a goal in many low-carbohydrate\nstudies, which further complicates evalu-\nating the distinct contribution of the eat-\ning pattern (47,121,125,167).\nThe quality of carbohydrate and/or\nwhat is absent from the diet may contrib-\nute to confounding results. However,\nwhen core dimensions of the comparative\ndiets are similar, there is little difference\nin outcome measures. When Gardner et\nal. (168) tested a low-carbohydrate keto-\ngenic diet and a low-carbohydrate Medi-\nterranean diet, in a randomized crossover\ndesign, metabolic improvements were\nseen in both diets without signi\ufb01cant dif-\nferences between them. Each of the in-\nterventions avoided added sugars and\nre\ufb01ned grains and included nonstarchy\nvegetables. Legumes, fruits, and whole in-\ntact grains were included in the Mediter-\nranean but not in the ketogenic diet. The\nimprovements (fasting glucose, insulin,\nHDL cholesterol, and A1C) were likely due\nto the nutritional quality of both interven-\ntions. However, the ketogenic plan led\nto a greater decrease in triglycerides\n(168) but also a greater increase in LDL\ncholesterol.\nAs studies on low-carbohydrate eating\nplans generally indicate challenges with\nlong-term sustainability (143), it is impor-\ntant to reassess and individualize meal\nplan guidance regularly for those inter-\nested in this approach. Health care pro-\nfessionals should maintain consistent\nmedical oversight and recognize that in-\nsulin and other diabetes medications\nmay need to be adjusted to prevent\nhypoglycemia, and blood pressure will\nneed to be monitored. In addition, very-\nlow-carbohydrate eating plans are not\ncurrently recommended for individuals\nwho are pregnant or lactating, children,\npeople who have renal disease, or peo-\nple with or at risk for disordered eating,\nand these plans should be used with\ncaution in those taking sodium\u2013glucose\ncotransporter 2 inhibitors because of the\npotential risk of ketoacidosis (169,170).\nRegardless of amount of carbohydrate\nin the meal plan, focus should be placed\non high-quality, nutrient-dense carbohy-\ndrate sources that are high in \ufb01ber and\nminimally processed. The addition of die-\ntary \ufb01ber modulates composition of gut\nmicrobiota and increases gut microbial\ndiversity. Although there is still much to\nbe elucidated with the gut microbiome\nand chronic disease, higher-\ufb01ber diets are\nadvantageous (171). Both children and\nadults with diabetes are encouraged to\nminimize intake of re\ufb01ned carbohydrates\nwith added sugars, fat, and sodium and\ninstead focus on carbohydrates from veg-\netables, legumes, fruits, dairy (milk and\nyogurt), and whole grains. People with di-\nabetes and those at risk for diabetes are\nencouraged to consume a minimum of\n14 g of \ufb01ber/1,000 kcal, with at least half\nof grain consumption being whole, intact\ngrains, according to the Dietary Guidelines\nfor Americans (172). Regular intake of suf-\n\ufb01cient dietary \ufb01ber is associated with\nlower all-cause mortality in people with\ndiabetes (173,174), and prospective co-\nhort studies have found dietary \ufb01ber in-\ntake is inversely associated with risk of\ntype 2 diabetes (175\u2013177). The consump-\ntion of sugar-sweetened beverages and\nprocessed food products with large amoun-\nts of re\ufb01ned grains and added sugars is\nstrongly discouraged (172,178,179), as\nthese have the capacity to displace health-\nier, more nutrient-dense food choices.\nIndividuals with type 1 or type 2 dia-\nbetes taking insulin at mealtime should\nbe offered intensive and ongoing educa-\ntion on the need to couple insulin ad-\nministration with carbohydrate intake.\nFor people whose meal schedule or car-\nbohydrate consumption is variable, regu-\nlar education to increase understanding\nof the relationship between carbohy-\ndrate intake and insulin needs is impor-\ntant. In addition, education on using\ninsulin-to-carbohydrate ratios for meal\nplanning can assist individuals with effec-\ntively modifying insulin dosing from meal\nto meal to improve glycemic manage-\nment (97,156,180\u2013183). Studies have\nshown that dietary fat and protein can\nimpact early and delayed postprandial gly-\ncemia (184\u2013187), and it appears to have\na dose-dependent response (188\u2013191).\nResults from high-fat, high-protein meal\nstudies highlight the need for additional\ninsulin to cover these meals; however,\nmore studies are needed to determine\nthe optimal insulin dose and delivery\nstrategy. The results from these studies\nalso point to individual differences in\npostprandial glycemic response; there-\nfore, a cautious approach to increasing\ninsulin doses for high-fat and/or high-\nprotein mixed meals is recommended\nto address delayed hyperglycemia that\nmay occur 3 h or more after eating (70).\nIf using an insulin pump, a split bolus\nfeature (part of the bolus delivered im-\nmediately, the remainder over a pro-\ngrammed duration of time) may provide\nS74\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "better insulin coverage for high-fat and/or\nhigh-protein mixed meals (185,192).\nThe effectiveness of insulin dosing\ndecisions should be con\ufb01rmed with a\nstructured approach to blood glucose\nmonitoring or continuous glucose moni-\ntoring to evaluate individual responses\nand guide insulin dose adjustments.\nChecking glucose 3 h after eating may\nhelp to determine if additional insulin\nadjustments are required (i.e., increas-\ning or stopping bolus) (185,192,193).\nRe\ufb01ning insulin doses to account for\nhigh-fat and/or -protein meals requires\ndetermination of anticipated nutrient\nintake to calculate the mealtime dose.\nFood literacy, numeracy, interest, and ca-\npability should be evaluated (70). For indi-\nviduals on a \ufb01xed daily insulin schedule,\nmeal planning should emphasize a rela-\ntively \ufb01xed carbohydrate consumption\npattern with respect to both time and\namount while considering insulin action.\nAttention to resultant hunger and satiety\ncues will also help with nutrient modi\ufb01ca-\ntions throughout the day (70,194).\nProtein\nThere is no evidence that adjusting the\ndaily level of protein intake (typically\n1\u20131.5 g/kg body wt/day or 15\u201320% total\ncalories) will improve health, and re-\nsearch is inconclusive regarding the ideal\namount of dietary protein to optimize\neither glycemic management or CVD\nrisk (159,195). Therefore, protein intake\ngoals should be individualized based on\ncurrent eating patterns. Some research\nhas found successful management of\ntype 2 diabetes with meal plans including\nslightly higher levels of protein (20\u201330%),\nwhich may contribute to increased satiety\n(196).\nHistorically, low-protein eating plans\nwere advised for individuals with dia-\nbetic kidney disease (DKD) (with albumin-\nuria and/or reduced estimated glomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate); however, current evidence\ndoes not suggest that people with DKD\nneed to restrict protein to less than the\ngenerally recommended protein intake\n(70). Reducing the amount of dietary pro-\ntein below the recommended daily allow-\nance of 0.8 g/kg is not recommended\nbecause it does not alter glycemic meas-\nures, cardiovascular risk measures, or the\nrate at which glomerular \ufb01ltration rate de-\nclines and may increase risk for malnutri-\ntion (197,198).\nIn individuals with type 2 diabetes,\nprotein intake may enhance or increase\nthe insulin response to dietary carbohy-\ndrates (199). Therefore, use of carbohy-\ndrate sources high in protein (e.g., nuts)\nto treat or prevent hypoglycemia should\nbe avoided due to the potential concur-\nrent rise in endogenous insulin. Health\ncare professionals should counsel pa-\ntients to treat hypoglycemia with pure\nglucose (i.e., glucose tablets) or carbo-\nhydrate-containing foods at the hypogly-\ncemia alert value of <70 mg/dL. See\nSection 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for more\ninformation.\nFats\nEvidence suggests that there is not an\nideal percentage of calories from fat for\npeople with or at risk for diabetes and\nthat macronutrient distribution should be\nindividualized according to the patient\u2019s\neating patterns, preferences, and meta-\nbolic goals (70). The type of fats con-\nsumed is more important than total\namount of fat when looking at metabolic\ngoals and CVD risk, and it is recom-\nmended that the percentage of total cal-\nories from saturated fats should be\nlimited (120,172,200\u2013202). Multiple RCTs\nincluding people with type 2 diabetes\nhave reported that a Mediterranean eat-\ning pattern (120,203\u2013208) can improve\nboth glycemic management and blood\nlipids. The Mediterranean eating pattern\nis based on the traditional eating habits\nin the countries bordering the Mediterra-\nnean Sea. Although eating styles vary,\nthey share a number of common features,\nincluding consumption of fresh fruits and\nvegetables, whole grains, beans, and nuts/\nseeds; olive oil as the primary fat source;\nlow to moderate amounts of \ufb01sh, eggs,\nand poultry; and limited added sugars,\nsugary beverages, sodium, highly proc-\nessed foods, re\ufb01ned carbohydrates, satu-\nrated fats, and fatty or processed meats.\nEvidence does not conclusively support\nrecommending n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid\n[EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA])\nsupplements for all people with diabetes\nfor the prevention or treatment of cardio-\nvascular events (70,209,210). In individuals\nwith type 2 diabetes, two systematic\nreviews with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids\nconcluded that the dietary supplements\ndid not improve glycemic management\n(159,211). In the ASCEND trial (A Study of\nCardiovascular Events iN Diabetes), when\ncompared with placebo, supplementation\nwith n-3 fatty acids at the dose of\n1 g/day did not lead to cardiovascular\nbene\ufb01t in people with diabetes without\nevidence of CVD (212). However, results\nfrom the Reduction of Cardiovascular\nEvents With Icosapent Ethyl\u2013Interven-\ntion Trial (REDUCE-IT) found that supple-\nmentation with 4 g/day of pure EPA\nsigni\ufb01cantly lowered the risk of adverse\ncardiovascular events. This trial of 8,179\nparticipants, in which over 50% had dia-\nbetes, found a 5% absolute reduction in\ncardiovascular events for individuals with\nestablished atherosclerotic CVD taking a\npreexisting statin with residual hypertrigly-\nceridemia (135\u2013499 mg/dL) (213). See\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d for more information.\nPeople with diabetes should be advised\nto follow the guidelines for the general\npopulation for the recommended in-\ntakes of saturated fat, dietary choles-\nterol, and trans fat (172). Trans fats\nshould be avoided. In addition, as satu-\nrated fats are progressively decreased\nin the diet, they should be replaced\nwith unsaturated fats and not with re-\n\ufb01ned carbohydrates (207).\nSodium\nAs for the general population, people\nwith diabetes are advised to limit their\nsodium consumption to <2,300 mg/day\n(70). Restriction to <1,500 mg, even for\nthose with hypertension, is generally not\nrecommended (214\u2013216). Sodium recom-\nmendations should take into account pal-\natability, availability, affordability, and the\ndif\ufb01culty of achieving low-sodium recom-\nmendations in a nutritionally adequate\ndiet (217).\nMicronutrients and Supplements\nThere continues to be no clear evidence\nof bene\ufb01t from herbal or nonherbal (i.e.,\nvitamin or mineral) supplementation for\npeople with diabetes without underlying\nde\ufb01ciencies (70). Metformin is associated\nwith vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency per a report\nfrom the Diabetes Prevention Program\nOutcomes Study (DPPOS), suggesting that\nperiodic testing of vitamin B12 levels\nshould be considered in people taking\nmetformin, particularly in those with ane-\nmia or peripheral neuropathy (218). Rou-\ntine supplementation with antioxidants,\nsuch as vitamins E and C, is not advised\ndue to lack of evidence of ef\ufb01cacy and\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nS75\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "concern related to long-term safety. Based\non the recent U.S. Preventative Services\nTask Force statement, the harms of\nb-carotene outweigh the bene\ufb01ts for the\nprevention of CVD or cancer. b-Carotene\nwas signi\ufb01cantly associated with increased\nlung cancer and cardiovascular mortality\nrisk (219).\nIn addition, there is insuf\ufb01cient evidence\nto support the routine use of herbal sup-\nplements and micronutrients, such as cin-\nnamon (220), curcumin, vitamin D (221),\naloe vera, or chromium, to improve glyce-\nmia in people with diabetes (70,222).\nAlthough the Vitamin D and Type 2\nDiabetes Study (D2d) prospective RCT\nshowed no signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t of vitamin\nD versus placebo on the progression to\ntype 2 diabetes in individuals at high\nrisk (223), post hoc analyses and meta-\nanalyses suggest a potential bene\ufb01t in\nspeci\ufb01c populations (223\u2013226). Further\nresearch is needed to de\ufb01ne individual\ncharacteristics and clinical indicators\nwhere vitamin D supplementation may\nbe of bene\ufb01t.\nFor special populations, including preg-\nnant or lactating individuals, older adults,\nvegetarians, and people following very-\nlow-calorie or low-carbohydrate diets, a\nmultivitamin may be necessary.\nAlcohol\nModerate alcohol intake does not have\nmajor detrimental effects on long-term\nblood glucose management in people\nwith diabetes. Risks associated with alco-\nhol consumption include hypoglycemia\nand/or delayed hypoglycemia (particu-\nlarly for those using insulin or insulin se-\ncretagogue therapies), weight gain, and\nhyperglycemia (for those consuming ex-\ncessive amounts) (70,222). People with\ndiabetes should be educated about these\nrisks and encouraged to monitor glucose\nfrequently after drinking alcohol to mini-\nmize such risks. People with diabetes\ncan follow the same guidelines as those\nwithout diabetes. For women, no more\nthan one drink per day, and for men, no\nmore than two drinks per day is recom-\nmended (one drink is equal to a 12-oz\nbeer, a 5-oz glass of wine, or 1.5 oz of\ndistilled spirits).\nNonnutritive Sweeteners\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nhas approved many nonnutritive sweet-\neners for consumption by the general\npublic, including people with diabetes\n(70,227). For some people with diabetes\nwho are accustomed to regularly consum-\ning sugar-sweetened products, nonnutri-\ntive sweeteners (containing few or no\ncalories) may be an acceptable substitute\nfor nutritive sweeteners (those containing\ncalories, such as sugar, honey, and agave\nsyrup) when consumed in moderation\n(228,229). Nonnutritive sweeteners do\nnot appear to have a signi\ufb01cant effect on\nglycemic management (97,230,231), and\nthey can reduce overall calorie and carbo-\nhydrate intake (97,228) as long as individ-\nuals are not compensating with additional\ncalories from other food sources (70,232).\nThere is mixed evidence from systematic\nreviews and meta-analyses for nonnu-\ntritive sweetener use with regard to\nweight management, with some \ufb01nd-\ning bene\ufb01t in weight loss (233\u2013235)\nwhile other research suggests an associa-\ntion with weight gain (236,237). This may\nbe explained by reverse causality and re-\nsidual confounding variables (237). The\naddition of nonnutritive sweeteners to\ndiets poses no bene\ufb01t for weight loss or\nreduced weight gain without energy re-\nstriction (238). In a recent systematic re-\nview and meta-analysis using low-calorie\nand no-calorie sweetened beverages as an\nintended substitute for sugar-sweetened\nbeverages, a small improvement in body\nweight and cardiometabolic risk factors\nwas seen without evidence of harm and\nhad a direction of bene\ufb01t similar to that\nseen with water. Health care professionals\nshould continue to recommend water, but\npeople with overweight or obesity and dia-\nbetes may also have a variety of no-calorie\nor low-calorie sweetened products so that\nthey do not feel deprived (239).\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY\nRecommendations\n5.28 Children and adolescents with\ntype 1 diabetes C or type 2 dia-\nbetes or prediabetes B should\nengage in 60 min/day or more\nof moderate- or vigorous-inten-\nsity aerobic activity, with vigor-\nous\nmuscle-strengthening\nand\nbone-strengthening activities at\nleast 3 days/week.\n5.29 Most adults with type 1 diabetes\nC and type 2 diabetes B should\nengage in 150 min or more of\nmoderate- to vigorous-intensity\naerobic activity per week, spread\nover at least 3 days/week, with\nno more than 2 consecutive\ndays without activity. Shorter du-\nrations (minimum 75 min/week)\nof vigorous-intensity or interval\ntraining may be suf\ufb01cient for\nyounger and more physically \ufb01t\nindividuals.\n5.30 Adults with type 1 diabetes C\nand type 2 diabetes B should\nengage in 2\u20133 sessions/week of\nresistance exercise on noncon-\nsecutive days.\n5.31 All adults, and particularly those\nwith type 2 diabetes, should de-\ncrease the amount of time spent\nin daily sedentary behavior. B\nProlonged sitting should be inter-\nrupted every 30 min for blood\nglucose bene\ufb01ts. C\n5.32 Flexibility training and balance\ntraining are recommended 2\u20133\ntimes/week for older adults with\ndiabetes. Yoga and tai chi may\nbe included based on individual\npreferences to increase \ufb02exibility,\nmuscular strength, and balance. C\n5.33 Evaluate baseline physical activ-\nity and sedentary time. Promote\nincrease in nonsedentary activi-\nties above baseline for seden-\ntary individuals with type 1\ndiabetes E and type 2 diabetes.\nB Examples include walking, yoga,\nhousework, gardening, swimming,\nand dancing.\nPhysical activity is a general term that in-\ncludes all movement that increases en-\nergy use and is an important part of the\ndiabetes management plan. Exercise is a\nmore speci\ufb01c form of physical activity\nthat is structured and designed to im-\nprove physical \ufb01tness. Both physical activ-\nity and exercise are important. Exercise\nhas been shown to improve blood glu-\ncose levels, reduce cardiovascular risk\nfactors, contribute to weight loss, and\nimprove well-being (240). Physical activ-\nity is as important for those with type 1\ndiabetes as it is for the general popula-\ntion, but its speci\ufb01c role in the preven-\ntion of diabetes complications and the\nmanagement of blood glucose is not as\nclear as it is for those with type 2 diabe-\ntes. Many individuals with type 2 diabe-\ntes do not meet the recommended\nexercise level per week (150 min).\nS76\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Objective measurement by accelerome-\nter in 871 individuals with type 2 diabe-\ntes showed that 44.2%, 42.6%, and\n65.1% of White, African American, and\nHispanic individuals, respectively, met\nthe recommended threshold of exercise\n(241). An RCT in 1,366 individuals with\nprediabetes combined a physical activity\nintervention with text messaging and tele-\nphone support, which showed improve-\nment in daily step count at 12 months\ncompared with the control group. Un-\nfortunately, this was not sustained at\n48 months (242). Another RCT, including\n324 individuals with prediabetes, showed\nincreased physical activity at 8 weeks\nwith supportive text messages, but by 12\nweeks there was no difference between\ngroups (243). It is important for diabetes\ncare management teams to understand\nthe dif\ufb01culty that many people have\nreaching recommended treatment tar-\ngets and to identify individualized ap-\nproaches to improve goal achievement,\nwhich may need to change over time.\nModerate to high volumes of aerobic\nactivity are associated with substantially\nlower cardiovascular and overall mortal-\nity risks in both type 1 and type 2 dia-\nbetes (244). A prospective observational\nstudy of adults with type 1 diabetes\nsuggested that higher amounts of physi-\ncal activity led to reduced cardiovascu-\nlar mortality after a mean follow-up\ntime of 11.4 years for people with and\nwithout chronic kidney disease (245).\nAdditionally, structured exercise inter-\nventions of at least 8 weeks\u2019 duration\nhave been shown to lower A1C by an\naverage of 0.66% in people with type 2\ndiabetes, even without a signi\ufb01cant\nchange in BMI (246). There are also con-\nsiderable data for the health bene\ufb01ts\n(e.g., increased cardiovascular \ufb01tness,\ngreater muscle strength, improved insulin\nsensitivity) of regular exercise for those\nwith type 1 diabetes (247). Exercise train-\ning in type 1 diabetes may also improve\nseveral important markers such as triglyc-\neride level, LDL cholesterol, waist circum-\nference, and body mass (248). In adults\nwith type 2 diabetes, higher levels of\nexercise intensity are associated with\ngreater improvements in A1C and in car-\ndiorespiratory \ufb01tness (249); sustained im-\nprovements in cardiorespiratory \ufb01tness\nand weight loss have also been associated\nwith a lower risk of heart failure (250).\nOther bene\ufb01ts include slowing the decline\nin mobility among overweight people\nwith diabetes (251). The ADA position\nstatement \u201cPhysical Activity/Exercise and\nDiabetes\u201d reviews the evidence for the\nbene\ufb01ts of exercise in people with type 1\nand type 2 diabetes and offers speci\ufb01c rec-\nommendations (252). Increased physical\nactivity (soccer training) has also been\nshown to be bene\ufb01cial for improving\noverall \ufb01tness in Latino men with obe-\nsity, demonstrating feasible methods to\nincrease physical activity in an often\nhard-to-engage population (253). Physical\nactivity and exercise should be recom-\nmended and prescribed to all individuals\nwho are at risk for or with diabetes as\npart of management of glycemia and\noverall health. Speci\ufb01c recommendations\nand precautions will vary by the type of\ndiabetes, age, activity, and presence of\ndiabetes-related health complications. Rec-\nommendations should be tailored to meet\nthe speci\ufb01c needs of each individual (252).\nExercise and Children\nAll children, including children with diabe-\ntes or prediabetes, should be encouraged\nto engage in regular physical activity. Chil-\ndren should engage in at least 60 min of\nmoderate to vigorous aerobic activity ev-\nery day, with muscle- and bone-strength-\nening activities at least 3 days per week\n(254). In general, youth with type 1 dia-\nbetes bene\ufb01t from being physically active,\nand an active lifestyle should be recom-\nmended to all (255). Youth with type 1\ndiabetes who engage in more physical ac-\ntivity may have better health outcomes\nand health-related quality of life (256,257).\nSee Section 14, \u201cChildren and Adole-\nscents,\u201d for details.\nFrequency and Type of Physical\nActivity\nPeople with diabetes should perform\naerobic and resistance exercise regularly\n(209). Aerobic activity bouts should ide-\nally last at least 10 min, with the goal of\n\u000130 min/day or more most days of the\nweek for adults with type 2 diabetes.\nDaily exercise, or at least not allowing\nmore than 2 days to elapse between\nexercise sessions, is recommended to\ndecrease insulin resistance, regardless\nof diabetes type (258,259). A study in\nadults with type 1 diabetes found a dose-\nresponse inverse relationship between\nself-reported bouts of physical activity\nper week and A1C, BMI, hypertension,\ndyslipidemia, and diabetes-related complica-\ntions such as hypoglycemia, diabetic\nketoacidosis, retinopathy, and microalbu-\nminuria (260). Over time, activities should\nprogress in intensity, frequency, and/\nor duration to at least 150 min/week\nof moderate-intensity exercise. Adults\nable to run at 6 miles/h (9.7 km/h) for at\nleast 25 min can bene\ufb01t suf\ufb01ciently from\nshorter-intensity activity (75 min/week)\n(252). Many adults, including most with\ntype 2 diabetes, may be unable or un-\nwilling to participate in such intense ex-\nercise and should engage in moderate\nexercise for the recommended duration.\nAdults with diabetes should engage in\n2\u20133 sessions/week of resistance exer-\ncise on nonconsecutive days (261). Al-\nthough heavier resistance training with\nfree weights and weight machines may\nimprove glycemic control and strength\n(262), resistance training of any intensity\nis recommended to improve strength,\nbalance, and the ability to engage in ac-\ntivities of daily living throughout the life\nspan. Health care professionals should\nhelp people with diabetes set stepwise\ngoals toward meeting the recommended\nexercise targets. As individuals intensify\ntheir exercise program, medical monitor-\ning may be indicated to ensure safety\nand evaluate the effects on glucose man-\nagement. (See PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GLYCEMIC\nCONTROL, below.)\nEvidence supports that all individuals,\nincluding those with diabetes, should be\nencouraged to reduce the amount of\ntime spent being sedentary\u2014waking be-\nhaviors with low energy expenditure\n(e.g., working at a computer, watching\ntelevision)\u2014by breaking up bouts of\nsedentary activity (>30 min) by brie\ufb02y\nstanding, walking, or performing other\nlight physical activities (263,264). Partici-\npating in leisure-time activity and avoid-\ning extended sedentary periods may help\nprevent type 2 diabetes for those at risk\n(265,266) and may also aid in glycemic\nmanagement for those with diabetes.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis\nfound higher frequency of regular leisure-\ntime physical activity was more effective\nin reducing A1C levels (267). A wide\nrange of activities, including yoga, tai chi,\nand other types, can have signi\ufb01cant im-\npacts on A1C, \ufb02exibility, muscle strength,\nand\nbalance\n(240,268\u2013270).\nFlexibility\nand balance exercises may be particularly\nimportant in older adults with diabetes to\nmaintain range of motion, strength, and\nbalance (252) (Fig. 5.1).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nS77\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Physical Activity and Glycemic\nManagement\nClinical trials have provided strong evi-\ndence for the A1C-lowering value of resis-\ntance training in older adults with type 2\ndiabetes (252) and for an additive bene\ufb01t\nof combined aerobic and resistance exer-\ncise in adults with type 2 diabetes (271).\nIf not contraindicated, people with type 2\ndiabetes should be encouraged to do at\nleast two weekly sessions of resistance\nexercise (exercise with free weights or\nweight machines), with each session con-\nsisting of at least one set (group of con-\nsecutive repetitive exercise motions) of\n\ufb01ve or more different resistance exercises\ninvolving the large muscle groups (272).\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, al-\nthough exercise, in general, is associated\nwith improvement in disease status, care\nneeds to be taken in titrating exercise\nwith respect to glycemic management.\nEach individual with type 1 diabetes has a\nvariable glycemic response to exercise.\nThis variability should be taken into con-\nsideration when recommending the type\nand duration of exercise for a given indi-\nvidual (247).\nIndividuals of childbearing potential\nwith preexisting diabetes, particularly\ntype 2 diabetes, and those at risk for or\npresenting with gestational diabetes mel-\nlitus should be advised to engage in reg-\nular moderate physical activity prior to\nand during their pregnancies as tolerated\n(252).\nPre-exercise Evaluation\nAs discussed more fully in Section 10,\n\u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk Manage-\nment,\u201d the best protocol for assessing\nasymptomatic people with diabetes for\ncoronary artery disease remains unclear.\nThe ADA consensus report \u201cScreening for\nCoronary Artery Disease in Patients With\nDiabetes\u201d (273) concluded that routine\ntesting is not recommended. However,\nhealth care professionals should perform\na careful history, assess cardiovascular risk\nfactors, and be aware of the atypical pre-\nsentation of coronary artery disease, such\nas recent reported or tested decrease in\nexercise tolerance in people with diabetes.\nCertainly, those with high risk should be\nencouraged to start with short periods of\nlow-intensity exercise and slowly increase\nthe intensity and duration as tolerated.\nHealth care professionals should assess\nfor conditions that might contraindicate\ncertain types of exercise or predispose to\ninjury, such as uncontrolled hyperten-\nsion, untreated proliferative retinopathy,\nautonomic neuropathy, peripheral neu-\nropathy, and a history of foot ulcers or\nCharcot foot. Age and previous physical\nactivity level should be considered when\ncustomizing the exercise plan to the indi-\nvidual\u2019s needs. Those with complications\nmay need a more thorough evaluation\nprior to starting an exercise program\n(247).\nHypoglycemia\nIn individuals taking insulin and/or insu-\nlin secretagogues, physical activity may\ncause hypoglycemia if the medication\ndose or carbohydrate consumption is\nnot adjusted for the exercise bout and\npostbout impact on glucose. Individuals on\nthese therapies may need to ingest some\nadded carbohydrate if pre-exercise glucose\nlevels are <90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L), de-\npending on whether they are able to\nlower insulin doses during the workout\n(such as with an insulin pump or reduced\npre-exercise insulin dosage), the time of\nday exercise is done, and the intensity\nand duration of the activity (247). In\nsome people with diabetes, hypoglyce-\nmia after exercise may occur and last for\nseveral hours due to increased insulin\nsensitivity. Hypoglycemia is less common\nin those who are not treated with insulin\nor insulin secretagogues, and no routine\npreventive measures for hypoglycemia\nare usually advised in these cases. In-\ntense activities may actually raise blood\nglucose levels instead of lowering them,\nespecially if pre-exercise glucose levels\nare elevated (247). Because of the varia-\ntion in glycemic response to exercise\nbouts, people with diabetes need to be\neducated to check blood glucose levels\nbefore and after periods of exercise and\nabout the potential prolonged effects\n(depending on intensity and duration).\nExercise in the Presence of\nMicrovascular Complications\nSee Section 11, \u201cChronic Kidney Disease\nand Risk Management,\u201d and Section 12,\n\u201cRetinopathy,\nNeuropathy,\nand\nFoot\nCare,\u201d for more information on these\nlong-term complications.\nRetinopathy\nIf proliferative diabetic retinopathy or\nsevere nonproliferative diabetic retinop-\nathy is present, then vigorous-intensity\naerobic or resistance exercise may be\ncontraindicated because of the risk of\ntriggering vitreous hemorrhage or reti-\nnal detachment (274). Consultation\nwith an ophthalmologist prior to engag-\ning in an intense exercise plan may be\nappropriate.\nPeripheral Neuropathy\nDecreased pain sensation and a higher\npain threshold in the extremities can\nresult in an increased risk of skin break-\ndown, infection, and Charcot joint de-\nstruction with some forms of exercise.\nTherefore, a thorough assessment should\nbe done to ensure that neuropathy does\nnot alter kinesthetic or proprioceptive\nsensation during physical activity, partic-\nularly in those with more severe neurop-\nathy. Studies have shown that moderate-\nintensity walking may not lead to an in-\ncreased risk of foot ulcers or reulceration\nin those with peripheral neuropathy who\nuse proper footwear (275). In addition,\n150 min/week of moderate exercise was\nreported to improve outcomes in people\nwith prediabetic neuropathy (276). All indi-\nviduals with peripheral neuropathy should\nwear proper footwear and examine their\nfeet daily to detect lesions early. Anyone\nwith a foot injury or open sore should be\nrestricted to non\u2013weight-bearing activities.\nAutonomic Neuropathy\nAutonomic neuropathy can increase the\nrisk of exercise-induced injury or adverse\nevents through decreased cardiac respon-\nsiveness to exercise, postural hypotension,\nimpaired thermoregulation, impaired\nnight vision due to impaired papillary re-\naction, and greater susceptibility to hypo-\nglycemia (277). Cardiovascular autonomic\nneuropathy is also an independent risk\nfactor for cardiovascular death and silent\nmyocardial ischemia (278). Therefore, in-\ndividuals with diabetic autonomic neurop-\nathy should undergo cardiac investigation\nbefore beginning physical activity more\nintense than that to which they are\naccustomed.\nDiabetic Kidney Disease\nPhysical activity can acutely increase\nurinary albumin excretion. However,\nthere is no evidence that vigorous-in-\ntensity exercise accelerates the rate of\nprogression of DKD, and there appears\nto be no need for speci\ufb01c exercise re-\nstrictions for people with DKD in gen-\neral (274).\nS78\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "SMOKING CESSATION: TOBACCO\nAND E-CIGARETTES\nRecommendations\n5.34 Advise all individuals not to use\ncigarettes and other tobacco\nproducts or e-cigarettes. A\n5.35 After identi\ufb01cation of tobacco or\ne-cigarette use, include smoking\ncessation counseling and other\nforms of treatment as a routine\ncomponent of diabetes care. A\n5.36 Address smoking cessation as\npart\nof\ndiabetes\neducation\nprograms for those in need. B\nResults from epidemiologic, case-control,\nand cohort studies provide convincing\nevidence to support the causal link be-\ntween cigarette smoking and health risks\n(279). Data show tobacco use is higher\namong adults with chronic conditions\n(280) as well as in adolescents and young\nadults with diabetes (281). People with di-\nabetes who smoke (and people with dia-\nbetes exposed to second-hand smoke)\nhave a heightened risk of CVD, premature\ndeath, microvascular complications, and\nworse glycemic outcomes when com-\npared with those who do not smoke\n(282\u2013284). Smoking may have a role in\nthe development of type 2 diabetes\n(285\u2013287).\nThe routine and thorough assessment\nof tobacco use is essential to prevent\nsmoking or encourage cessation. Numer-\nous large RCTs have demonstrated the\nef\ufb01cacy and cost-effectiveness of brief\ncounseling in smoking cessation, includ-\ning the use of telephone quit lines, in\nreducing tobacco use. Pharmacologic ther-\napy to assist with smoking cessation in\npeople with diabetes has been shown to\nbe effective (288), and for people who are\nmotivated to quit, the addition of pharma-\ncologic therapy to counseling is more ef-\nfective than either treatment alone (289).\nSpecial considerations should include as-\nsessment of level of nicotine dependence,\nwhich is associated with dif\ufb01culty in quit-\nting and relapse (290). Although some\npeople may gain weight in the period\nshortly after smoking cessation (291), re-\ncent research has demonstrated that this\nweight gain does not diminish the sub-\nstantial CVD bene\ufb01t realized from smoking\ncessation (292). One study in people who\nsmoke who had newly diagnosed type 2\ndiabetes found that smoking cessation\nwas associated with amelioration of meta-\nbolic parameters and reduced blood pres-\nsure and albuminuria at 1 year (293).\nIn\nrecent\nyears,\ne-cigarettes\nhave\ngained public awareness and popularity\nbecause of perceptions that e-cigarette\nuse is less harmful than regular cigarette\nsmoking (294,295). However, in light of\nrecent Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention evidence (296) of deaths re-\nlated to e-cigarette use, no individuals\nshould be advised to use e-cigarettes, ei-\nther as a way to stop smoking tobacco or\nas a recreational drug.\nDiabetes education programs offer po-\ntential to systematically reach and engage\nindividuals with diabetes in smoking ces-\nsation efforts. A cluster randomized trial\nfound statistically signi\ufb01cant increases in\nquit rates and long-term abstinence rates\n(>6 months) when smoking cessation\ninterventions were offered through dia-\nbetes education clinics, regardless of\nmotivation to quit at baseline (297).\nSUPPORTING POSITIVE HEALTH\nBEHAVIORS\nRecommendation\n5.37 Behavioral strategies should be\nused to support diabetes self-\nmanagement and engagement\nin health behaviors (e.g., taking\nmedications, using diabetes tech-\nnologies, physical activity, healthy\neating) to promote optimal dia-\nbetes health outcomes. A\nGiven associations with glycemic out-\ncomes and risk for future complications\n(298,299), it is important for diabetes\ncare professionals to support people\nwith diabetes to engage in health-\npromoting behaviors (preventive, treat-\nment, and maintenance), including blood\nglucose monitoring, taking insulin and\nmedications, using diabetes technolo-\ngies, engaging in physical activity, and\nmaking nutritional changes. Evidence\nsupports using a variety of behavioral\nstrategies and multicomponent inter-\nventions to help people with diabetes\nand their caregivers or family members\ndevelop health behavior routines and\novercome barriers to self-management\nbehaviors (300\u2013302). Behavioral strate-\ngies with empirical support include moti-\nvational interviewing (303\u2013305), patient\nactivation (306), goal setting and action\nplanning (305,307\u2013309), problem-solving\n(308,310), tracking or self-monitoring\nhealth behaviors with or without feedback\nfrom a health care professional (305,307\u2013\n309), and facilitating opportunities for so-\ncial support (305,308,309). Multicompo-\nnent intervention packages have the\nhighest ef\ufb01cacy for behavioral and glyce-\nmic outcomes (300,309,311). For youth\nwith diabetes, family-based behavioral\nintervention packages and multisystem\ninterventions that facilitate health be-\nhavior change demonstrate bene\ufb01t for\nincreasing management behaviors and\nimproving glycemic outcomes (301).\nHealth behavior change strategies may be\ndelivered by mental health professionals,\nDCES, or other trained health care profes-\nsionals (307,312\u2013314) or quali\ufb01ed com-\nmunity health workers (307,308). These\napproaches may be delivered via digital\nhealth tools (309,313,315).\nPSYCHOSOCIAL CARE\nRecommendations\n5.38 Psychosocial care should be pro-\nvided to all people with diabe-\ntes, with the goal of optimizing\nhealth-related quality of life and\nhealth outcomes. Such care\nshould be integrated with rou-\ntine medical care and delivered\nby trained health care profes-\nsionals using a collaborative,\nperson-centered, culturally in-\nformed approach. A When in-\ndicated and available, quali\ufb01ed\nmental\nhealth\nprofessionals\nshould provide additional tar-\ngeted mental health care. B\n5.39 Diabetes care teams should im-\nplement psychosocial screening\nprotocols that may include but\nare\nnot\nlimited\nto\nattitudes\nabout diabetes, expectations for\ntreatment and outcomes, gen-\neral and diabetes-related mood,\nstress and/or quality of life, avail-\nable resources (\ufb01nancial, social,\nfamily, and emotional), and/or\npsychiatric\nhistory.\nScreening\nshould occur at periodic inter-\nvals and when there is a change\nin disease, treatment, or life cir-\ncumstances.

B\n5.41 Consider screening older adults\n(aged $65 years) with diabetes\nfor cognitive impairment, frailty,\nand depressive symptoms. Mon-\nitoring of cognitive capacity, i.e.,\nthe ability to actively engage in\ndecision-making regarding treat-\nment plan behaviors, is advised. B\nPlease refer to the ADA position state-\nment \u201cPsychosocial Care for People With\nDiabetes\u201d for a list of assessment tools\nand additional details (1) and the ADA\nMental Health Toolkit for assessment\nquestionnaires and surveys (professional.\ndiabetes.org/mental-health-toolkit).\nComplex environmental, social, fam-\nily, behavioral, and emotional factors,\nknown as psychosocial factors, in\ufb02uence\nliving with diabetes, both type 1 and\ntype 2, and achieving optimal health\noutcomes and psychological well-being.\nThus, individuals with diabetes and their\nfamilies are challenged with complex,\nmultifaceted issues when integrating di-\nabetes care into daily life (183). Clini-\ncally signi\ufb01cant mental health diagnoses\nare considerably more prevalent in peo-\nple with diabetes than in those without\n(316,317). Emotional well-being is an im-\nportant part of diabetes care and self-\nmanagement. Psychological and social\nproblems can impair the individual\u2019s\n(43,318\u2013322) or family\u2019s (321) ability to\ncarry out diabetes care tasks and, there-\nfore, potentially compromise health sta-\ntus. Therefore, psychological symptoms,\nboth clinical and subclinical, must be ad-\ndressed. In addition to impacting a per-\nson\u2019s ability to carry out self-management\nand the association of mental health diag-\nnosis with poorer short-term glycemic sta-\nbility, symptoms of emotional distress are\nassociated with mortality risk (316,323).\nThere are opportunities for diabetes\nhealth care professionals to routinely\nmonitor and screen psychosocial status\nin a timely and ef\ufb01cient manner for\nreferral to appropriate services (324,325).\nVarious health care professionals working\nwith people with diabetes may contrib-\nute to psychosocial care in different ways\nbased on training, experience, need, and\navailability (313,326,327). Ideally, quali-\n\ufb01ed mental health professionals with\nspecialized training and experience in\ndiabetes should be integrated with or\nprovide collaborative care as part of dia-\nbetes care teams (328\u2013331), or referrals\nfor in-depth assessment and treatment\nfor psychosocial concerns should be\nmade to such mental health professionals\nwhen indicated (314,332,333). A system-\natic review and meta-analysis showed\nthat psychosocial interventions modestly\nbut signi\ufb01cantly improved A1C (standard-\nized mean difference \u20130.29%) and mental\nhealth outcomes (334). There was a lim-\nited association between the effects on\nA1C and mental health, and no interven-\ntion characteristics predicted bene\ufb01t on\nboth outcomes. However, cost analyses\nhave shown that behavioral health inter-\nventions are both effective and cost-ef\ufb01-\ncient approaches to the prevention of\ndiabetes (335).\nScreening\nHealth care teams should develop and\nimplement psychosocial screening pro-\ntocols to ensure routine monitoring of\npsychosocial well-being and concerns\namong people with diabetes, following\npublished guidance and recommenda-\ntions (336\u2013340). Topics to screen for\nmay include, but are not limited to, at-\ntitudes about diabetes, expectations\nfor treatment and outcomes (especially\nrelated to starting a new treatment or\ntechnology), general and diabetes-related\nmood, stress, and/or quality of life (e.g.,\ndiabetes distress, depressive symptoms,\nanxiety symptoms, and/or fear of hypo-\nglycemia), available resources (\ufb01nancial,\nsocial, family, and emotional), and/or psy-\nchiatric history. A list of age-appropriate\nscreening and evaluation measures is\nprovided in the ADA position statement\n\u201cPsychosocial Care for People with Dia-\nbetes\u201d (1). Key opportunities for psychoso-\ncial screening occur at diabetes diagnosis,\nduring regularly scheduled management\nvisits, during hospitalizations, with new\nonset of complications, during signi\ufb01cant\ntransitions in care such as from pediatric\nto adult care teams (341), at the time of\nmedical treatment changes, or when\nproblems with achieving A1C goals, quality\nof life, or self-management are identi\ufb01ed.\nPeople with diabetes are likely to exhibit\npsychological vulnerability at diagnosis,\nwhen their medical status changes (e.g.,\nend of the honeymoon period), when the\nneed for intensi\ufb01ed treatment is evident,\nand when complications are discovered.\nSigni\ufb01cant changes in life circumstances\nand SDOH are known to considerably af-\nfect a person\u2019s ability to self-manage their\ncondition. Thus, screening for SDOH (e.g.,\nloss of employment, birth of a child, or\nother family-based stresses) should also\nbe incorporated into routine care (342).\nIn circumstances where individuals other\nthan the person with diabetes are signif-\nicantly involved in diabetes management\n(e.g., caregivers or family members),\nthese issues should be monitored and\ntreated by appropriate professionals\n(341,343,344).\nStandardized, validated, age-appropriate\ntools for psychosocial monitoring and\nscreening can also be used (1). Health\ncare professionals may also use informal\nverbal inquires, for example, by asking\nwhether there have been persistent\nchanges in mood during the past 2 weeks\nor since the individual\u2019s last appointment\nand whether the person can identify a\ntriggering event or change in circumstan-\nces. Diabetes care professionals should\nalso ask whether there are new or dif-\nferent barriers to treatment and self-\nmanagement, such as feeling overwhelmed\nor stressed by having diabetes (see DIABETES\nDISTRESS, below), changes in \ufb01nances, or\ncompeting medical demands (e.g., the\ndiagnosis of a comorbid condition).\nPsychological Assessment and\nTreatment\nWhen psychosocial concerns are identi-\n\ufb01ed, referral to a quali\ufb01ed behavioral\nand/or mental health professional, ideally\none specializing in diabetes, should be\nmade for comprehensive evaluation, diag-\nnosis, and treatment (313,314,332,333).\nIndications for referral may include posi-\ntive screening for overall stress related to\nwork-life balance, diabetes distress, diabe-\ntes management dif\ufb01culties, depression,\nanxiety, disordered eating, and cognitive\ndysfunction (see Table 5.2 for a complete\nlist). It is preferable to incorporate psycho-\nsocial assessment and treatment into rou-\ntine care rather than waiting for a speci\ufb01c\nproblem or deterioration in metabolic or\npsychological status to occur (38,321).\nS80\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

In\nrecognition of limited behavioral health\nresources and to optimize availability,\nother health care professionals who\nhave been trained in behavioral and\nmental health interventions may also\nprovide this specialized psychosocial\ncare (326,329,345,346). Although some\nhealth care professionals may not feel\nquali\ufb01ed to treat psychological problems\n(347), optimizing the relationship be-\ntween a person with diabetes and health\ncare professional may increase the likeli-\nhood of the individual accepting referral\nfor other services. Collaborative care\ninterventions and a team approach\nhave demonstrated ef\ufb01cacy in diabe-\ntes self-management, outcomes of de-\npression, and psychosocial functioning\n(5,6).\nEvidence supports interventions for\npeople with diabetes and psychosocial\nconcerns, including issues that affect\nmental and behavioral health. Successful\ntherapeutic approaches include cogni-\ntive behavioral (330,332,348,349) and\nmindfulness-based therapies (346,350,351).\nSee the sections below for details about\ninterventions for speci\ufb01c psychological\nconcerns. Behavioral interventions may\nalso be indicated in a preventive\nmanner even in the absence of positive\npsychosocial screeners, such as resil-\nience-promoting interventions to pre-\nvent diabetes distress in adolescence\n(352,353) and behavioral family interven-\ntions to promote collaborative family dia-\nbetes management in early adolescence\n(354,355) or to support adjustment to a\nnew treatment plan or technology (64).\nPsychosocial interventions can be delivered\nvia digital health platforms (356). Group-\nbased or shared diabetes appointments\nthat address both medical and psycho-\nsocial issues relevant to living with diabe-\ntes are a promising model to consider\n(327,357).\nAlthough ef\ufb01cacy has been demon-\nstrated with psychosocial interven-\ntions, there has been varying success\nregarding sustained increases in en-\ngagement in health behaviors and im-\nproved glycemic outcomes associated\nwith behavioral and mental health is-\nsues.

Refer to a quali\ufb01ed men-\ntal health professional or other\ntrained health care professional\nfor further assessment and\ntreatment if indicated. B\nDiabetes distress is very common (321,\n358\u2013360). While it shares some features\nwith depression, diabetes distress is dis-\ntinct and has unique relationships with\nglycemic and other outcomes (359,361).\nDiabetes distress refers to signi\ufb01cant\nnegative psychological reactions related\nto emotional burdens and worries spe-\nci\ufb01c to an individual\u2019s experience in hav-\ning to manage a severe, complicated,\nand demanding chronic condition such\nas diabetes (358,359,362). The constant\nbehavioral demands of diabetes self-\nmanagement (medication dosing, frequency,\nand titration; monitoring of glucose,\nfood intake, eating patterns, and physical\nactivity) and the potential or actuality of\ndisease progression are directly associ-\nated with reports of diabetes distress\n(358). The prevalence of diabetes distress\nis reported to be 18\u201345%, with an inci-\ndence of 38\u201348% over 18 months in\npeople with type 2 diabetes (362). In the\nsecond Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and\nNeeds (DAWN2) study, signi\ufb01cant diabe-\ntes distress was reported by 45% of the\nparticipants, but only 24% reported that\ntheir health care teams asked them how\ndiabetes affected their lives (321). Simi-\nlar rates have been identi\ufb01ed among\nadolescents with type 1 diabetes (360)\nand in parents of youth with type 1\ndiabetes. High levels of diabetes distress\nsigni\ufb01cantly\nimpact\nmedication-taking\nbehaviors and are linked to higher A1C,\nlower self-ef\ufb01cacy, and less optimal eat-\ning and exercise behaviors (5,358,362).\nDiabetes distress is also associated with\nsymptoms of anxiety, depression, and\nreduced health-related quality of life\n(363).\nDiabetes distress should be routinely\nmonitored (364) using diabetes-speci\ufb01c\nvalidated measures (1).

This may include speci\ufb01c\ndiabetes education to address areas of\ndiabetes self-care causing distress and\nimpacting clinical management and/or\nbehavioral intervention from a quali\ufb01ed\nmental health professional, ideally with\nexpertise in diabetes, or from another\ntrained health care professional. Several\neducational and behavioral intervention\nstrategies have demonstrated bene\ufb01ts for\ndiabetes distress and, to a lesser degree,\nglycemic outcomes, including education,\npsychological therapies such as cognitive\nbehavioral therapy and mindfulness-based\ntherapies, and health behavior change\napproaches such as motivational inter-\nviewing (348,349,365,366). Data support\ndiabetes distress interventions delivered\nusing technology (356). DSMES has been\nshown to reduce diabetes distress (5)\nand may also bene\ufb01t A1C when com-\nbined with peer support (367). It may\nbe helpful to provide counseling regard-\ning expected\ndiabetes-related\nversus\ngeneralized psychological distress, both\nat diagnosis and when disease state or\ntreatment changes occur (368). A multi-\nsite RCT with adults with type 1 diabe-\ntes and elevated diabetes distress and\nA1C demonstrated large improvements\nin diabetes distress and small reductions\nin A1C through two 3-month interven-\ntion approaches: a diabetes education\nintervention with goal setting and a\npsychological intervention that included\nemotion regulation skills, motivational in-\nterviewing, and goal setting (369). Among\nadults with type 2 diabetes in the Veter-\nans Affairs system, an RCT demonstrated\nbene\ufb01ts of integrating a single session of\nmindfulness intervention into DSMES, fol-\nlowed by a booster session and mobile\napp-based home practice over 24 weeks,\nwith the strongest effects on diabetes dis-\ntress (370). An RCT of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy demonstrated positive bene\ufb01ts\nfor diabetes distress, A1C, and depressive\nsymptoms for up to 1 year among adults\nwith type 2 diabetes and elevated symp-\ntoms of distress or depression (371). An\nRCT among people with type 1 and type 2\ndiabetes found mindful self-compassion\ntraining increased self-compassion, re-\nduced depression and diabetes distress,\nand improved A1C (372). An RCT of a\nresilience-focused\ncognitive\nbehavioral\nand social problem-solving intervention\ncompared with diabetes education (353)\nin teens with type 1 diabetes showed\nthat diabetes distress and depressive\nsymptoms were signi\ufb01cantly reduced for\nup to 3 years post-intervention, though\nneither A1C nor self-management behav-\niors improved over time. These recent\nstudies support that a combination of ed-\nucational, behavioral, and psychological\nintervention approaches is needed to ad-\ndress distress, depression, and A1C.\nAs with treatment of other diabetes-\nassociated behavioral and psychosocial\nfactors affecting disease outcomes, there\nis little outcome data on long-term sys-\ntematic treatment of diabetes distress in-\ntegrated into routine care. As the diabetes\ndisease course and its management are\n\ufb02uid, it can be expected that related dis-\ntress may \ufb02uctuate and may need differ-\nent methods of remediation at different\npoints in the life course and as disease\nprogression occurs.\nAnxiety\nRecommendations\n5.43 Consider screening people with\ndiabetes for anxiety symptoms or\ndiabetes-related worries. Health\ncare professionals can discuss\ndiabetes-related worries and may\nrefer to a quali\ufb01ed mental health\nprofessional for further assess-\nment and treatment if anxiety\nsymptoms indicate interference\nwith diabetes self-management\nbehaviors or quality of life. B\n5.44 Refer people with hypoglyce-\nmia unawareness, which can\nco-occur with fear of hypogly-\ncemia, to a trained professional\nto receive evidence-based in-\ntervention to help re-establish\nawareness of symptoms of hy-\npoglycemia and reduce fear of\nhypoglycemia. A\nAnxiety symptoms and diagnosable disor-\nders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder,\nbody dysmorphic disorder, obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, speci\ufb01c phobias,\nand posttraumatic stress disorder) are\ncommon in people with diabetes (373).\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance\nSystem estimated the lifetime preva-\nlence of generalized anxiety disorder to\nbe 19.5% in people with either type 1\nor type 2 diabetes (374). A common\ndiabetes-speci\ufb01c concern is fears related\nto hypoglycemia (375,376), which may\nexplain avoidance of behaviors associ-\nated with lowering glucose, such as in-\ncreasing insulin doses or frequency of\nmonitoring. Other common sources of\ndiabetes-related anxiety include not meet-\ning blood glucose targets (373), insulin in-\njections or infusion (377), and onset of\ncomplications (1). People with diabetes\nwho exhibit excessive diabetes self-man-\nagement behaviors well beyond what is\nprescribed or needed to achieve glyce-\nmic targets may be experiencing symp-\ntoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(378). General anxiety is a predictor of\ninjection-related anxiety and is associ-\nated with fear of hypoglycemia (376,379).\nPsychological and\nbehavioral\ncare\ncan be helpful to address symptoms of\nanxiety in people with diabetes. Among\nadults with type 2 diabetes and elevated\ndepressive symptoms, an RCT of collabo-\nrative care demonstrated bene\ufb01ts on anx-\niety symptoms for up to 1 year (380).\nFear of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia\nunawareness often co-occur, so interven-\ntions aimed at treating one often bene\ufb01t\nboth (381). If fear of hypoglycemia is\nidenti\ufb01ed and a person does not have\nsymptoms of hypoglycemia, a struc-\ntured program of blood glucose aware-\nness training delivered in routine clinical\npractice can improve A1C, reduce the\nrate of severe hypoglycemia, and re-\nstore hypoglycemia awareness (382,383).\nIf not available within the practice set-\nting, a structured program targeting\nboth fear of hypoglycemia and un-\nawareness should be sought out and\nimplemented by a quali\ufb01ed behavioral\npractitioner\n(381,383\u2013385). An RCT\ncomparing\nblood\nglucose\nawareness\ntraining with a cognitively focused psy-\nchoeducation program in adults with\ntype 1 diabetes and impaired awareness\nof hypoglycemia that has been treat-\nment resistant suggested that both ap-\nproaches were bene\ufb01cial for reducing\nhypoglycemia (386). Thus, specialized\nbehavioral intervention from a trained\nhealth care professional is needed to\ntreat hypoglycemia-related anxiety and\nunawareness.\nDepression\nRecommendations\n5.45 Consider at least annual screen-\ning of depressive symptoms in\nS82\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "all people with diabetes, espe-\ncially those with a self-reported\nhistory of depression. Use age-\nappropriate, validated depression\nscreening measures, recognizing\nthat further evaluation will be\nnecessary for individuals who\nhave a positive screen. B\n5.46 Beginning at diagnosis of compli-\ncations or when there are signif-\nicant changes in medical status,\nconsider assessment for depres-\nsion. B\n5.47 Refer to quali\ufb01ed mental health\nprofessionals or other trained\nhealth care professionals with\nexperience using evidence-based\ntreatment approaches for de-\npression in conjunction with col-\nlaborative care with the diabetes\ntreatment team. A\nHistory of depression, current depres-\nsion, and antidepressant medication use\nare risk factors for the development of\ntype 2 diabetes, especially if the individ-\nual has other risk factors such as obesity\nand family history of type 2 diabetes\n(387\u2013389). Elevated depressive symp-\ntoms and depressive disorders affect one\nin four people with type 1 or type 2 dia-\nbetes (320). Thus, routine screening for\ndepressive symptoms is indicated in this\nhigh-risk population, including people\nwith type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus, and postpar-\ntum diabetes. Regardless of diabetes\ntype, women have signi\ufb01cantly higher\nrates of depression than men (390).\nRoutine monitoring with age-appropriate\nvalidated measures (1) can help to iden-\ntify if referral is warranted (333,339).\nMultisite studies have demonstrated feasi-\nbility of implementing depressive symp-\ntom screening protocols in diabetes clinics\nand published practical guides for imple-\nmentation (336\u2013339,391). Adults with a\nhistory of depressive symptoms need on-\ngoing monitoring of depression recurrence\nwithin the context of routine care (387).\nIntegrating mental and physical health\ncare can improve outcomes. When a per-\nson with diabetes is receiving psychologi-\ncal therapy, the mental/behavioral health\nprofessional should be incorporated into\nor collaborate with the diabetes treat-\nment team (392). As with DSMES, person-\ncentered collaborative care approaches\nhave been shown to improve both de-\npression and medical outcomes (392).\nDepressive symptoms may also be a man-\nifestation of reduced quality of life sec-\nondary to disease burden (also see DIABETES\nDISTRESS, above) and resultant changes in\nresource allocation impacting the person\nand their family. When depressive symp-\ntoms are identi\ufb01ed, it is important to\nquery origins, both diabetes-speci\ufb01c and\ndue to other life circumstances (363,393).\nTrials have shown consistent evidence\nof improvements in depressive symptoms\nand variable bene\ufb01ts for A1C when depres-\nsion is simultaneously treated (331,392,394),\nwhether through pharmacological treat-\nment, group therapy, psychotherapy, or\ncollaborative care (328,348,349,395,396).\nPsychological interventions targeting de-\npressive symptoms have shown ef\ufb01cacy\nwhen delivered via digital technologies\n(397). Physical activity interventions also\ndemonstrate bene\ufb01ts for depressive symp-\ntoms and A1C (398). It is important to\nnote that medical treatment plan should\nalso be monitored in response to reduc-\ntion in depressive symptoms. People may\nagree to or adopt previously refused\ntreatment strategies (improving ability to\nfollow recommended treatment behav-\niors), which may include increased physical\nactivity and intensi\ufb01cation of treatment\nplan behaviors and monitoring, resulting in\nchanged glucose pro\ufb01les.\nDisordered Eating Behavior\nRecommendations\n5.48 Consider screening for disordered\nor disrupted eating using vali-\ndated screening measures when\nhyperglycemia and weight loss\nare unexplained based on self-\nreported behaviors related to\nmedication dosing, meal plan,\nand physical activity. In addition,\na review of the medical treat-\nment plan is recommended to\nidentify potential treatment-\nrelated effects on hunger/caloric\nintake. B\n5.49 Consider reevaluating the treat-\nment plan of people with diabe-\ntes who present with symptoms\nof disordered eating behavior,\nan eating disorder, or disrupted\npatterns of eating, in consulta-\ntion with a quali\ufb01ed professional\nas available. Key quali\ufb01cations in-\nclude familiarity with the diabetes\ndisease physiology, treatments for\ndiabetes and disordered eating\nbehaviors, and weight-related\nand psychological risk factors for\ndisordered eating behaviors. B\nEstimated prevalence of disordered eat-\ning behavior and diagnosable eating dis-\norders in people with diabetes varies\n(399\u2013401). For people with type 1 dia-\nbetes, insulin omission causing glycos-\nuria in order to lose weight is the most\ncommonly reported disordered eating\nbehavior (402,403); in people with type 2\ndiabetes, bingeing (excessive food in-\ntake with an accompanying sense of\nloss of control) is most commonly re-\nported. For people with type 2 diabetes\ntreated with insulin, intentional omis-\nsion is also frequently reported (404).\nPeople with diabetes and diagnosable\neating disorders have high rates of co-\nmorbid psychiatric disorders (405). Peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes and eating\ndisorders have high rates of diabetes\ndistress and fear of hypoglycemia (406).\nDiabetes care professionals should\nmonitor for disordered eating behaviors\nusing validated measures (407). When\nevaluating symptoms of disordered or\ndisrupted eating (when the individual\nexhibits eating behaviors that appear\nmaladaptive but are not volitional, such\nas bingeing caused by loss of satiety\ncues), etiology and motivation for the\nbehavior should be evaluated (401,408).\nMixed intervention results point to the\nneed for treatment of eating disorders\nand disordered eating behavior in the\ncontext of the disease and its treat-\nment. Given the complexities of treating\ndisordered eating behaviors and disrupted\neating patterns in people with diabetes, it\nis recommended that multidisciplinary\ncare teams include or collaborate with a\nhealth professional trained to identify\nand treat eating behaviors with expertise\nin disordered eating and diabetes (409).\nKey quali\ufb01cations for such professionals\ninclude familiarity with the diabetes dis-\nease physiology, weight-related and\npsychological risk factors for disordered\neating behaviors, and treatments for dia-\nbetes and disordered eating behaviors.\nMore rigorous methods to identify under-\nlying mechanisms of action that drive\nchange in eating and treatment behaviors,\nas well as associated mental distress, are\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nS83\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Health care teams may\nconsider the appropriateness of technol-\nogy use among people with diabetes and\ndisordered eating behaviors, although\nmore research on the risks and bene\ufb01ts is\nneeded (411). Caution should be taken in\nlabeling individuals with diabetes as hav-\ning a diagnosable psychiatric disorder,\ni.e., an eating disorder, when disordered\nor disrupted eating patterns are found to\nbe associated with the disease and its\ntreatment. In other words, patterns of\nmaladaptive food intake that appear to\nhave a psychological origin may be driven\nby physiologic disruption in hunger and sa-\ntiety cues, metabolic perturbations, and/\nor secondary distress because of the indi-\nvidual\u2019s inability to control their hunger\nand satiety (401,408).\nThe use of incretin therapies may\nhave potential implications and rele-\nvance for the treatment of disrupted\nor disordered eating (see Section 8,\n\u201cObesity and Weight Management for\nthe Prevention and Treatment of Type 2\nDiabetes\u201d). These medications promote\nsubstantial weight loss and mainte-\nnance of lost weight beyond conven-\ntional nutrition therapies (412), which\nmay improve quality of life. Incretin\ntherapies work in the appetite and re-\nward circuitries to modulate food intake\nand energy balance, reducing uncontrolla-\nble hunger, overeating, and bulimic symp-\ntoms (413), although mechanisms are\nnot completely understood. Health care\nprofessionals may see expanded use of\nthese medications as data become\navailable (401). This therapy has the\npotential to improve psychosocial out-\ncomes and control overeating behav-\niors in people with diabetes, which may\nultimately bene\ufb01t engagement with med-\nical nutrition therapy recommendations\n(414). More research is needed about ad-\njunctive use of incretins and other medi-\ncations\naffecting\nphysiologically\nbased\neating behavior in people with diabetes.\nSerious Mental Illness\nRecommendations\n5.50 Provide an increased level of\nsupport for people with diabe-\ntes and serious mental illness\nthrough enhanced monitoring\nof and assistance with diabetes\nself-management behaviors. B\n5.51 In people who are prescribed\natypical antipsychotic medica-\ntions, screen for prediabetes\nand diabetes 4 months after\nmedication initiation and sooner\nif clinically indicated, at least\nannually. B\n5.52 If a second-generation antipsy-\nchotic medication is prescribed\nfor adolescents or adults with\ndiabetes,\nchanges\nin\nweight,\nglycemia, and cholesterol levels\nshould be carefully monitored,\nand the treatment plan should\nbe reassessed accordingly. C\nStudies of individuals with serious men-\ntal illness, particularly schizophrenia and\nother thought disorders, show signi\ufb01-\ncantly increased rates of type 2 diabetes\n(415). People with schizophrenia should\nbe monitored for type 2 diabetes be-\ncause of the known comorbidity. Disor-\ndered thinking and judgment can be\nexpected to make it dif\ufb01cult to engage\nin behavior that reduces risk factors for\ntype 2 diabetes, such as restrained eating\nfor weight management. Further, people\nwith serious mental health disorders and\ndiabetes frequently experience moderate\npsychological distress, suggesting perva-\nsive intrusion of mental health issues into\ndaily functioning (416).\nCoordinated management of diabe-\ntes or prediabetes and serious mental\nillness is recommended to achieve di-\nabetes treatment targets. The diabe-\ntes care team, in collaboration with\nother care professionals, should work\nto provide an enhanced level of care and\nself-management support for people with\ndiabetes and serious mental illness based\non individual capacity and needs. Such\ncare may include remote monitoring, fa-\ncilitating health care aides, and providing\ndiabetes training for family members,\ncommunity support personnel, and other\ncaregivers. Qualitative research suggests\nthat educational and behavioral interven-\ntion may provide bene\ufb01t via group sup-\nport, accountability, and assistance with\napplying diabetes knowledge (417). In ad-\ndition, those taking second-generation\n(atypical) antipsychotics, such as olanza-\npine, require greater monitoring because\nof an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes as-\nsociated with this medication (418\u2013420).\nBecause of this increased risk, people\nshould be screened for prediabetes or di-\nabetes 4 months after medication initia-\ntion and at least annually thereafter.\nSerious mental illness is often associated\nwith the inability to evaluate and utilize\ninformation to make judgments about\ntreatment options. When a person has\nan established diagnosis of a mental ill-\nness that impacts judgment, activities of\ndaily living, and ability to establish a col-\nlaborative relationship with care profes-\nsionals, it is wise to include a nonmedical\ncaretaker in decision-making regarding\nthe medical treatment plan. This person\ncan help improve the patient\u2019s ability to\nfollow the agreed-upon treatment plan\nthrough both monitoring and caretaking\nfunctions (421).\nCognitive Capacity/Impairment\nRecommendations\n5.53 Cognitive capacity should be\nmonitored throughout the life\nspan for all individuals with\ndiabetes, particularly in those\nwho have documented cogni-\ntive disabilities, those who ex-\nperience severe hypoglycemia,\nvery young children, and older\nadults. B\n5.54 If cognitive capacity changes or\nappears to be suboptimal for\npatient decision-making and/or\nbehavioral self-management, re-\nferral for a formal assessment\nshould be considered. E\nCognitive capacity is generally de\ufb01ned as\nattention, memory, logic and reasoning,\nand auditory and visual processing, all\nof which are involved in diabetes self-\nmanagement behavior (422). Having di-\nabetes over decades\u2014type 1 and type 2\u2014\nhas been shown to be associated with cog-\nnitive decline (423\u2013425). Declines have\nbeen shown to impact executive function\nand information processing speed; they are\nnot consistent between people, and evi-\ndence is lacking regarding a known course\nof decline (426). Diagnosis of dementia is\nalso more prevalent among people with\ndiabetes, both type 1 and type 2 (427).\nThus, monitoring of cognitive capacity of\nindividuals is recommended, particularly\nregarding their ability to self-monitor\nand make judgments about their symp-\ntoms, physical status, and needed altera-\ntions to their self-management behaviors,\nall of which are mediated by executive\nfunction (427). As with other disorders\naffecting mental capacity (e.g., major\npsychiatric disorders), the key issue is\nS84\nFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Youth will need second-party\nmonitoring (e.g., parents and adult care-\ngivers) until they are developmentally\nable to evaluate necessary information\nfor self-management decisions and to in-\nform resultant behavior changes.\nEpisodes of severe hypoglycemia are\nindependently associated with decline,\nas well as the more immediate symp-\ntoms of mental confusion (428). Early-\nonset type 1 diabetes has been shown\nto be associated with potential de\ufb01cits\nin intellectual abilities, especially in the\ncontext of repeated episodes of severe\nhypoglycemia (429). (See Section 14,\n\u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d for infor-\nmation on early-onset diabetes and cog-\nnitive abilities and the effects of severe\nhypoglycemia on children\u2019s cognitive and\nacademic performance.) Thus, for myriad\nreasons, cognitive capacity should be as-\nsessed during routine care to ascertain\nthe person\u2019s ability to maintain and ad-\njust self-management behaviors, such as\ndosing of medications, remediation ap-\nproaches to glycemic excursions, etc., and\nto determine whether to enlist a caregiver\nin monitoring and decision-making regard-\ning management behaviors. If cognitive\ncapacity to carry out self-maintenance be-\nhaviors is questioned, an age-appropriate\ntest of cognitive capacity is recommended\n(1). Cognitive capacity should be evalu-\nated in the context of the person\u2019s age,\nfor example, in very young children who\nare not expected to manage their disease\nindependently and in older adults who\nmay need active monitoring of treatment\nplan behaviors.\nSleep Health\nRecommendation\n5.55 Consider screening for sleep\nhealth in people with diabetes,\nincluding symptoms of sleep\ndisorders, disruptions to sleep\ndue to diabetes symptoms or\nmanagement needs, and wor-\nries about sleep. Refer to sleep\nmedicine and/or a quali\ufb01ed be-\nhavioral health professional as\nindicated. B\nThe associations between sleep prob-\nlems and diabetes are complex: sleep\ndisorders are a risk factor for developing\ntype 2 diabetes (430,431) and possibly\ngestational diabetes mellitus (432,433).\nMoreover, sleep disturbances are asso-\nciated with less engagement in diabetes\nself-management\nand\nmay\ninterfere\nwith the achievement of glycemic tar-\ngets among people with type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes (434\u2013439). Disrupted\nsleep and sleep disorders, including ob-\nstructive sleep apnea (440), insomnia,\nand sleep disturbances (435), are com-\nmon among people with diabetes. In\ntype 1 diabetes, estimates of poor sleep\nrange from 30% to 50% (441), and esti-\nmates of moderate to severe obstructive\nsleep apnea are >50% (436). In type 2\ndiabetes, 24\u201386% of people are esti-\nmated to have obstructive sleep apnea\n(442), 39% to have insomnia, and 8\u201345%\nto have restless leg syndrome (439). Risk\nof hypoglycemia poses speci\ufb01c challenges\nfor sleep in people with type 1 diabetes\nand may require targeted assessment\nand treatment approaches (443). People\nwith diabetes and their family members\nalso describe diabetes management needs\ninterfering with sleep and experiencing\nworries about poor sleep; technology has\nbeen described as both a help and chal-\nlenge in relation to sleep (444). Cognitive\nbehavioral therapy shows bene\ufb01ts for\nsleep in people with diabetes (348), in-\ncluding cognitive behavioral therapy for\ninsomnia, which demonstrates improve-\nments in sleep outcomes and possible\nsmall improvements in A1C and fasting\nglucose (445). There is also evidence that\nsleep\nextension\nand\npharmacological\ntreatments for sleep can improve sleep\noutcomes and possibly insulin resistance\n(443,445). Thus, referral to sleep special-\nists to address the medical and behav-\nioral aspects of sleep is recommended,\nideally in collaboration with the diabetes\ncare professional (Fig. 5.1).\nReferences\n1.

A1C is the metric used to date in clini-\ncal trials demonstrating the bene\ufb01ts of improved glycemic control. Individual glu-\ncose monitoring (discussed in detail in Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d) is a useful\ntool for diabetes self-management, which includes meals, physical activity, and\nmedication adjustment, particularly in individuals taking insulin. CGM serves an in-\ncreasingly important role in the management of the effectiveness and safety of\ntreatment in many people with type 1 diabetes and in selected people with type 2\ndiabetes. Individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can bene\ufb01t from CGM\nwith improved glucose control, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self-ef\ufb01cacy\n(Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d) (1).\nGlycemic Assessment\nRecommendations\n6.1 Assess glycemic status (A1C or other glycemic measurement such as time\nin range or glucose management indicator) at least two times a year in\npatients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic\ncontrol). E\n6.2 Assess glycemic status at least quarterly and as needed in patients whose\ntherapy has recently changed and/or who are not meeting glycemic\ngoals.

    "text": "(NGSP)-certi\ufb01ed assays (ngsp.org). The\ntest is the primary tool for assessing gly-\ncemic control and has a strong predictive\nvalue for diabetes complications (2\u20134).\nThus, A1C testing should be performed\nroutinely in all people with diabetes at\ninitial assessment and as part of continu-\ning care. Measurement approximately\nevery 3 months determines whether pa-\ntients\u2019 glycemic targets have been reached\nand maintained. A 14-day CGM assess-\nment of TIR and GMI can serve as a\nsurrogate for A1C for use in clinical\nmanagement (5\u20139). The frequency of\nA1C testing should depend on the clin-\nical situation, the treatment plan, and\nthe clinician\u2019s judgment. The use of\npoint-of-care A1C testing or\nCGM-\nderived TIR and GMI may provide an\nopportunity for more timely treatment\nchanges during encounters between pa-\ntients and health care professionals.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes with stable\nglycemia well within target may do well\nwith A1C testing or other glucose as-\nsessment only twice per year. Unstable\nor intensively managed patients or people\nnot at goal with treatment adjustments\nmay require testing more frequently (every\n3 months with interim assessments as\nneeded for safety) (10). CGM parameters\ncan be tracked in the clinic or via tele-\nhealth to optimize diabetes management.\nA1C Limitations\nThe A1C test is an indirect measure of av-\nerage glycemia and, as such, is subject to\nlimitations. As with any laboratory test,\nthere is variability in the measurement of\nA1C. Although A1C variability is lower on\nan intraindividual basis than that of blood\nglucose measurements, clinicians should\nexercise judgment when using A1C as\nthe sole basis for assessing glycemic con-\ntrol, particularly if the result is close to\nthe threshold that might prompt a\nchange in medication therapy. For exam-\nple, conditions that affect red blood cell\nturnover (hemolytic and other anemias,\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase de\ufb01-\nciency, recent blood transfusion, use of\ndrugs that stimulate erythropoiesis, end-\nstage kidney disease, and pregnancy)\nmay result in discrepancies between the\nA1C result and the patient\u2019s true mean\nglycemia (11). Hemoglobin variants must\nbe considered, particularly when the\nA1C result does not correlate with the\npatient\u2019s CGM or BGM levels. However,\nmost assays in use in the U.S. are accu-\nrate in individuals who are heterozygous\nfor the most common variants (ngsp.\norg/interf.asp). Other measures of aver-\nage glycemia such as fructosamine and\n1,5-anhydroglucitol are available, but\ntheir translation into average glucose\nlevels and their prognostic signi\ufb01cance\nare not as clear as for A1C and CGM.\nThough some variability in the relation-\nship between average glucose levels\nand A1C exists among different individ-\nuals, in general the association between\nmean glucose and A1C within an indi-\nvidual correlates over time (12).\nA1C does not provide a measure of\nglycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For\npatients prone to glycemic variability, es-\npecially people with type 1 diabetes or\ntype 2 diabetes with severe insulin de\ufb01-\nciency, glycemic control is best evaluated\nby the combination of results from BGM/\nCGM and A1C. Discordant results be-\ntween BGM/CGM and A1C can be the\nresult of the conditions outlined above\nor glycemic variability, with BGM miss-\ning the extremes.\nCorrelation Between BGM and A1C\nTable 6.1 shows the correlation between\nA1C levels and mean glucose levels based\non the international A1C-Derived Average\nGlucose (ADAG) study, which assessed\nthe correlation between A1C and fre-\nquent BGM and CGM in 507 adults (83%\nnon-Hispanic White) with type 1, type 2,\nand no diabetes (13), and an empirical\nstudy of the average blood glucose levels\nat premeal, postmeal, and bedtime asso-\nciated with speci\ufb01ed A1C levels using\ndata from the ADAG trial (14). The Amer-\nican Diabetes Association (ADA) and the\nAmerican Association for Clinical Chemis-\ntry have determined that the correlation\n(r = 0.92) in the ADAG trial is strong\nenough to justify reporting both the A1C\nresult and the estimated average glucose\n(eAG) result when a clinician orders the\nA1C test. Clinicians should note that the\nmean plasma glucose numbers in Table\n6.1 are based on \u00012,700 readings per\nA1C measurement in the ADAG trial. In a\nreport, mean glucose measured with\nCGM versus central laboratory\u2013measured\nA1C in 387 participants in three random-\nized trials demonstrated that A1C may\nunderestimate or overestimate mean glu-\ncose in individuals (12). Thus, as sug-\ngested, a patient\u2019s BGM or CGM pro\ufb01le\nhas considerable potential for optimizing\ntheir glycemic management (13).\nA1C Differences in Ethnic\nPopulations and Children\nIn the ADAG study, there were no signi\ufb01-\ncant differences among racial and ethnic\ngroups in the regression lines between\nA1C and mean glucose, although the\nstudy was underpowered to detect a dif-\nference and there was a trend toward a\ndifference between the African and Afri-\ncan American and the non-Hispanic White\ncohorts, with higher A1C values observed\nin the African and African American co-\nhorts compared with non-Hispanic White\ncohorts for a given mean glucose. Other\nstudies have also demonstrated higher A1C\nlevels in African American participants than\nin White participants at a given mean glu-\ncose concentration (15,16). In contrast, a\nrecent report in Afro-Caribbean individu-\nals found lower A1C relative to glucose\nvalues (17). Taken together, A1C and glu-\ncose parameters are essential for the op-\ntimal assessment of glycemic status.\nA1C assays are available that do not\ndemonstrate a statistically signi\ufb01cant dif-\nference in individuals with hemoglobin\nvariants. Other assays have statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant interference, but the differ-\nence is not clinically signi\ufb01cant. Use of\nan assay with such statistically signi\ufb01cant\ninterference may explain a report that\nTable 6.1\u2014Estimated average glucose\n(eAG)\nA1C (%)\nmg/dL*\nmmol/L\n5\n97 (76\u2013120)\n5.4 (4.2\u20136.7)\n6\n126 (100\u2013152)\n7.0 (5.5\u20138.5)\n7\n154 (123\u2013185)\n8.6 (6.8\u201310.3)\n8\n183 (147\u2013217)\n10.2 (8.1\u201312.1)\n9\n212 (170\u2013249)\n11.8 (9.4\u201313.9)\n10\n240 (193\u2013282)\n13.4 (10.7\u201315.7)\n11\n269 (217\u2013314)\n14.9 (12.0\u201317.5)\n12\n298 (240\u2013347)\n16.5 (13.3\u201319.3)\nData in parentheses are 95% CI.

    "text": "for any level of mean glycemia, African\nAmerican individuals heterozygous for\nthe common hemoglobin variant HbS\nhad lower A1C by about 0.3 percentage\npoints when compared with those with-\nout the trait (18,19). Another genetic\nvariant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate de-\nhydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of\nAfrican American individuals, was associ-\nated with a decrease in A1C of about\n0.8% in hemizygous men and 0.7% in\nhomozygous women compared with\nthose without the trait (20).\nA small study comparing A1C to CGM\ndata in children with type 1 diabetes\nfound a highly statistically signi\ufb01cant cor-\nrelation between A1C and mean blood\nglucose, although the correlation (r =\n0.7) was signi\ufb01cantly lower than that in\nthe ADAG trial (21). Whether there are\nclinically meaningful differences in how\nA1C relates to average glucose in chil-\ndren or in different ethnicities is an area\nfor further study (15,22,23). Until further\nevidence is available, it seems prudent\nto establish A1C goals in these popula-\ntions with consideration of individualized\nCGM, BGM, and A1C results. Limitations\nin perfect alignment between glycemic\nmeasurements do not interfere with the\nusefulness of BGM/CGM for insulin dose\nadjustments.\nGlucose Assessment by Continuous\nGlucose Monitoring\nRecommendations\n6.3 Standardized, single-page glucose\nreports from continuous glucose\nmonitoring (CGM) devices with\nvisual cues, such as the ambula-\ntory glucose pro\ufb01le, should be\nconsidered as a standard summary\nfor all CGM devices. E\n6.4 Time in range is associated with\nthe risk of microvascular com-\nplications and can be used for\nassessment of glycemic control.\nAdditionally, time below range\nand time above range are use-\nful parameters for the evaluation\nof the treatment plan (Table\n6.2). C\nCGM is rapidly improving diabetes man-\nagement. As stated in the recommenda-\ntions, time in range (TIR) is a useful\nmetric of glycemic control and glucose\npatterns, and it correlates well with A1C\nin most studies (24\u201329). New data sup-\nport the premise that increased TIR cor-\nrelates with the risk of complications.\nThe studies supporting this assertion\nare reviewed in more detail in Section 7,\n\u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d; they include cross-\nsectional data and cohort studies (30\u201332)\ndemonstrating TIR as an acceptable end\npoint for clinical trials moving forward\nand that it can be used for assessment\nof glycemic control. Additionally, time be-\nlow range (<70 and <54 mg/dL [3.9 and\n3.0 mmol/L]) and time above range\n(>180 mg/dL [10.0 mmol/L]) are useful\nparameters for insulin dose adjustments\nand reevaluation of the treatment plan.\nFor many people with diabetes, glu-\ncose monitoring is key for achieving\nglycemic targets. Major clinical trials of in-\nsulin-treated patients have included BGM\nas part of multifactorial interventions to\ndemonstrate the bene\ufb01t of intensive gly-\ncemic control on diabetes complications\n(33). BGM is thus an integral component\nof effective therapy of patients taking in-\nsulin. In recent years, CGM has become a\nstandard method for glucose monitoring\nfor most adults with type 1 diabetes (34).\nBoth approaches to glucose monitor-\ning allow patients to evaluate individ-\nual responses to therapy and assess\nwhether glycemic targets are being safely\nachieved. The international consensus on\nTIR provides guidance on standardized\nCGM metrics (Table 6.2) and considera-\ntions for clinical interpretation and care\n(35). To make these metrics more action-\nable, standardized reports with visual\ncues, such as the ambulatory glucose pro-\n\ufb01le (Fig 6.1), are recommended (35) and\nmay help the patient and the health care\nprofessional better interpret the data to\nguide treatment decisions (24,27). BGM\nand CGM can be useful to guide medical\nnutrition therapy and physical activity,\nprevent hypoglycemia, and aid medication\nmanagement. While A1C is currently the\nprimary measure to guide glucose man-\nagement and a valuable risk marker for\ndeveloping diabetes complications, the\nCGM metrics TIR (with time below range\nand time above range) and GMI provide\nthe insights for a more personalized dia-\nbetes management plan. The incorpora-\ntion of these metrics into clinical practice\nis in evolution, and remote access to\nthese data can be critical for telehealth. A\nrapid optimization and harmonization of\nCGM terminology and remote access is\noccurring to meet patient and health care\nprofessional needs (36\u201338). The patient\u2019s\nspeci\ufb01c needs and goals should dictate\nBGM frequency and timing and con-\nsideration of CGM use. Please refer to\nSection 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d for\na more complete discussion of the use\nof BGM and CGM.\nWith the advent of new technology,\nCGM has evolved rapidly in both accu-\nracy and affordability. As such, many pa-\ntients have these data available to assist\nwith self-management and their health\ncare professionals\u2019 assessment of glycemic\nstatus. Reports can be generated from\nCGM that will allow the health care\nprofessional and person with diabetes\nto determine TIR, calculate GMI, and\nTable 6.2\u2014Standardized CGM metrics for clinical care\n1.

Published data from two\nretrospective studies suggest a strong cor-\nrelation between TIR and A1C, with a\ngoal of 70% TIR aligning with an A1C of\n\u00017% (8,26). Note the goals of therapy\nnext to each metric in Fig. 6.1 (e.g., low,\n<4%; very low, <1%) as values to guide\nchanges in therapy.\nGLYCEMIC GOALS\nFor glycemic goals in older adults, please\nrefer to Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults.\u201d For\nglycemic goals in children, please refer to\nSection 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents.\u201d\nFor glycemic goals during pregnancy,\nplease refer to Section 15, \u201cManagement\nof Diabetes in Pregnancy.\u201d Overall, re-\ngardless of the population being served,\nit is critical for the glycemic targets to be\nwoven into the overall person-centered\nstrategy. For example, in a very young\nchild, safety and simplicity may outweigh\nthe need for glycemic stability in the\nshort run. Simpli\ufb01cation may decrease\nparental anxiety and build trust and\ncon\ufb01dence, which could support fur-\nther strengthening of glycemic targets\nand self-ef\ufb01cacy. In healthy older adults,\nthere is no empiric need to loosen con-\ntrol; however, less stringent A1C goals\nmay be appropriate for patients with\nlimited life expectancy or where the\nharms of treatment are greater than\nthe bene\ufb01ts (39,40).\nHowever, the health care professional\nneeds to work with an individual and\nshould consider adjusting targets for\nsimplifying the treatment plan if this\nchange is needed to improve safety and\nmedication-taking\nbehavior.\nSetting\ngoals by face-to-face or remote consul-\ntations has been shown to be more ef-\nfective than usual care for glycemic\ncontrol in type 2 diabetes for fasting\nplasma glucose and glycated hemoglo-\nbin (41).\nRecommendations\n6.5a An A1C goal for many non-\npregnant adults of <7% (53\nmmol/mol) without signi\ufb01cant\nhypoglycemia is appropriate. A\n6.5b If using ambulatory glucose\npro\ufb01le/glucose management in-\ndicator to assess glycemia, a\nparallel goal for many nonpreg-\nnant adults is time in range of\n>70% with time below range\n<4%\nand\ntime\n<54 mg/dL\n<1%. For those with frailty or\nat high risk of hypoglycemia, a\ntarget of >50% time in range\nwith <1% time below range\nis recommended. (See Fig. 6.1\nand Table 6.2.) B\n6.6\nOn the basis of health care\nprofessional judgment and pa-\ntient preference, achievement\nof lower A1C levels than the\ngoal of 7% may be acceptable\nand even bene\ufb01cial if it can be\nachieved safely without signi\ufb01-\ncant hypoglycemia or other ad-\nverse effects of treatment. B\n6.7\nLess stringent A1C goals (such\nas <8% [64 mmol/mol]) may\nbe appropriate for patients with\nlimited life expectancy or where\nthe harms of treatment are\ngreater than the bene\ufb01ts. Health\ncare professionals should con-\nsider deintensi\ufb01cation of ther-\napy if appropriate to reduce\nthe risk of hypoglycemia in pa-\ntients with inappropriate strin-\ngent A1C targets. B\n6.8\nReassess glycemic targets based\non the individualized criteria in\nFig. 6.2. E\n6.9\nSetting a glycemic goal during\nconsultations is likely to improve\npatient outcomes. E\nA1C and Microvascular Complications\nHyperglycemia de\ufb01nes diabetes, and gly-\ncemic control is fundamental to diabetes\nmanagement. The Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial (DCCT) (33), a prospec-\ntive randomized controlled trial of inten-\nsive (mean A1C about 7% [53 mmol/mol])\nversus standard (mean A1C about 9%\n[75 mmol/mol]) glycemic control in peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes, showed de\ufb01ni-\ntively that better glycemic control is\nassociated with 50\u201376% reductions in\nrates of development and progression\nof microvascular (retinopathy, neurop-\nathy, and diabetic kidney disease) com-\nplications. Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts\nin the Epidemiology of Diabetes Inter-\nventions and Complications (EDIC) study\n(42,43) demonstrated persistence of\nthese microvascular bene\ufb01ts over two\ndecades\ndespite\nthe\nfact\nthat\nthe\nglycemic separation between the treat-\nment groups diminished and disap-\npeared during follow-up.\nThe Kumamoto Study (44) and UK\nProspective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)\n(45,46) con\ufb01rmed that intensive gly-\ncemic control signi\ufb01cantly decreased\nrates of microvascular complications\nin people with short-duration type 2\ndiabetes. Long-term follow-up of the\nUKPDS cohorts showed enduring ef-\nfects of early glycemic control on most\nmicrovascular complications (47).\nTherefore, achieving A1C targets of\n<7% (53 mmol/mol) has been shown\nto reduce microvascular complications\nof type 1 and type 2 diabetes when in-\nstituted early in the course of disease\n(2,48). Findings from the DCCT (33) and\nUKPDS (49) studies demonstrate a curvi-\nlinear relationship between A1C and mi-\ncrovascular complications. Such analyses\nsuggest that, on a population level, the\ngreatest number of complications will\nbe averted by taking patients from very\npoor control to fair/good control. These\nanalyses also suggest that further lower-\ning of A1C from 7 to 6% (53 mmol/mol\nto 42 mmol/mol) is associated with\nfurther reduction in the risk of micro-\nvascular complications, although the\nabsolute risk reductions become much\nsmaller. The implication of these \ufb01ndings\nis that there is no need to deintensify\ntherapy for an individual with an A1C\nbetween 6 and 7% in the setting of\nlow hypoglycemia risk with a long life\nexpectancy. There are now newer agents\nthat do not cause hypoglycemia, making\nit possible to maintain glucose control\nwithout the risk of hypoglycemia (see\nSection 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches\nto Glycemic Treatment\u201d).\nGiven the substantially increased risk of\nhypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes and with\npolypharmacy in type 2 diabetes, the risks\nof lower glycemic targets may outweigh\nthe potential bene\ufb01ts on microvascular\ncomplications. Three landmark trials (Ac-\ntion to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Dia-\nbetes [ACCORD], Action in Diabetes and\nVascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron\nMR Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE],\nand Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial [VADT])\nwere conducted to test the effects of\nnear normalization of blood glucose\non cardiovascular outcomes in individ-\nuals with long-standing type 2 diabe-\ntes and either known cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) or high cardiovascular\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nGlycemic Targets\nS101\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "risk. These trials showed that lower\nA1C levels were associated with reduced\nonset or progression of some micro-\nvascular complications (50\u201352).\nThe concerning mortality \ufb01ndings\nin the ACCORD trial discussed below\nand the relatively intense efforts re-\nquired to achieve near euglycemia should\nalso be considered when setting gly-\ncemic targets for individuals with long-\nstanding diabetes, such as those popula-\ntions studied in ACCORD, ADVANCE, and\nVADT. Findings from these studies sug-\ngest caution is needed in treating diabe-\ntes to near-normal A1C goals in people\nwith long-standing type 2 diabetes with\nor at signi\ufb01cant risk of CVD.\nThese landmark studies need to be\nconsidered with an important caveat;\nglucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor\nagonists and sodium\u2013glucose cotrans-\nporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were not ap-\nproved at the time of these trials. As\nsuch, these agents with established car-\ndiovascular and renal bene\ufb01ts appear to\nbe safe and bene\ufb01cial in this group of\nindividuals at high risk for cardiorenal\ncomplications. Randomized clinical trials\nexamining these agents for cardiovas-\ncular safety were not designed to test\nhigher versus lower A1C; therefore,\nbeyond post hoc analysis of these tri-\nals, we do not have evidence that it is\nthe glucose lowering by these agents that\nconfers the CVD and renal bene\ufb01t (53).\nAs such, based on clinician judgment and\npatient preferences, select patients, espe-\ncially those with little comorbidity and a\nlong life expectancy, may bene\ufb01t from\nadopting more intensive glycemic targets\nif they can achieve them safely and with-\nout hypoglycemia or signi\ufb01cant thera-\npeutic burden.\nA1C and Cardiovascular Disease\nOutcomes\nCardiovascular Disease and Type 1 Diabetes\nCVD is a more common cause of death\nthan microvascular complications in pop-\nulations with diabetes. There is evidence\nfor a cardiovascular bene\ufb01t of intensive\nglycemic control after long-term follow-\nup of cohorts treated early in the course\nof type 1 diabetes. In the DCCT, there\nwas a trend toward lower risk of CVD\nevents with intensive control. In the\n9-year post-DCCT follow-up of the\nEDIC cohort, participants previously\nrandomized to the intensive arm had\na signi\ufb01cant 57% reduction in the risk\nof nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI),\nstroke, or cardiovascular death com-\npared with those previously randomized\nto the standard arm (54). The bene\ufb01t of\nintensive glycemic control in this cohort\nwith type 1 diabetes has been shown\nto persist for several decades (55) and\nto be associated with a modest reduction\nin all-cause mortality (56).\nCardiovascular Disease and Type 2 Diabetes\nIn type 2 diabetes, there is evidence\nthat more intensive treatment of glyce-\nmia in newly diagnosed patients may\nreduce long-term CVD rates. In addition,\ndata from the Swedish National Diabe-\ntes Registry (56) and the Joint Asia Dia-\nbetes Evaluation (JADE) demonstrate\ngreater proportions of people with dia-\nbetes being diagnosed at <40 years of\nage and a demonstrably increased bur-\nden of heart disease and years of life\nlost in people diagnosed at a younger\nage (57\u201360). Thus, to prevent both mi-\ncrovascular and macrovascular compli-\ncations of diabetes, there is a major call\nto overcome therapeutic inertia and\ntreat to target for an individual patient\n(60,61). During the UKPDS, there was a\n16% reduction in CVD events (combined\nfatal or nonfatal MI and sudden death)\nin the intensive glycemic control arm\nthat did not reach statistical signi\ufb01cance\n(P = 0.052), and there was no sugges-\ntion of bene\ufb01t on other CVD outcomes\n(e.g., stroke). Similar to the DCCT/EDIC,\nafter 10 years of observational follow-\nup, those originally randomized to in-\ntensive glycemic control had signi\ufb01cant\nlong-term reductions in MI (15% with\nsulfonylurea or insulin as initial pharma-\ncotherapy, 33% with metformin as ini-\ntial pharmacotherapy) and in all-cause\nmortality (13% and 27%, respectively)\n(47).\nACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT sug-\ngested no signi\ufb01cant reduction in CVD\noutcomes with intensive glycemic control\nin participants followed for shorter dura-\ntions (3.5\u20135.6 years) and who had more\nadvanced type 2 diabetes and CVD risk\nthan the UKPDS participants. All three tri-\nals were conducted in relatively older par-\nticipants with a longer known duration\nof diabetes (mean duration 8\u201311 years)\nand either CVD or multiple cardio-\nvascular risk factors. The target A1C\namong intensive-control participants\nwas <6% (42 mmol/mol) in ACCORD,\n<6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in ADVANCE,\nlow\nPatient / Disease Features\nRisks potentially associated\nwith hypoglycemia and\nother drug adverse effects\nDisease duration\nLife expectancy\nImportant comorbidities\nEstablished vascular\ncomplications\nPatient preference\nResources and support\nsystem\nMore stringent\nApproach to Individualization of Glycemic Targets\nLess stringent\nA1C 7%\nhigh\nlong-standing\nshort\nsevere\nsevere\npreference for less\nburdensome therapy\nlimited\nPotentially modifiable\nUsually not modifiable\nnewly diagnosed\nlong\nabsent\nabsent\nhighly motivated, excellent\nself-care capabilities\nreadily available\nfew / mild\nfew / mild\nFigure 6.2\u2014Patient and disease factors used to determine optimal glycemic targets.

Details of these studies are\nreviewed extensively in the joint ADA\nposition statement \u201cIntensive Glycemic\nControl and the Prevention of Cardio-\nvascular Events: Implications of the\nACCORD, ADVANCE, and VA Diabetes\nTrials\u201d (61).\nThe glycemic control comparison in\nACCORD was halted early due to an in-\ncreased mortality rate in the intensive\ncompared with the standard treatment\narm (1.41% vs. 1.14% per year; hazard\nratio 1.22 [95% CI 1.01\u20131.46]), with a\nsimilar increase in cardiovascular deaths.\nAnalysis of the ACCORD data did not\nidentify a clear explanation for the excess\nmortality in the intensive treatment arm\n(62).\nLonger-term follow-up has shown no\nevidence of cardiovascular bene\ufb01t, or\nharm, in the ADVANCE trial (63). The end-\nstage renal disease rate was lower in the\nintensive treatment group over follow-up.\nHowever, 10-year follow-up of the VADT\ncohort (64) did demonstrate a reduction\nin the risk of cardiovascular events (52.7\n[control group] vs. 44.1 [intervention\ngroup] events per 1,000 person-years)\nwith no bene\ufb01t in cardiovascular or\noverall mortality. Heterogeneity of mor-\ntality effects across studies was noted,\nwhich may re\ufb02ect differences in glyce-\nmic targets, therapeutic approaches,\nand, importantly, population characteris-\ntics (65).\nMortality \ufb01ndings in ACCORD (62) and\nsubgroup analyses of VADT (66) suggest\nthat the potential risks of intensive glyce-\nmic control may outweigh its bene\ufb01ts\nin higher-risk individuals. In all three\ntrials, severe hypoglycemia was signi\ufb01-\ncantly more likely in participants who\nwere randomly assigned to the inten-\nsive glycemic control arm. Individuals\nwith a long duration of diabetes, a known\nhistory of hypoglycemia, advanced ath-\nerosclerosis, or advanced age/frailty may\nbene\ufb01t from less aggressive targets\n(67,68).\nAs discussed further below, severe\nhypoglycemia is a potent marker of high\nabsolute risk of cardiovascular events\nand mortality (69). Therefore, health\ncare professionals should be vigilant\nin preventing hypoglycemia and should\nnot aggressively attempt to achieve\nnear-normal A1C levels in people in\nwhom such targets cannot be safely\nand reasonably achieved. As discussed\nin Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches\nto Glycemic Treatment,\u201d addition of spe-\nci\ufb01c SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor\nagonists that have demonstrated CVD\nbene\ufb01t is recommended in patients\nwith established CVD, chronic kidney\ndisease, and heart failure. As outlined in\nmore detail in Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic\nApproaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d and\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d the cardiovascular\nbene\ufb01ts of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 re-\nceptor agonists are not contingent upon\nA1C lowering; therefore, initiation can\nbe considered in people with type 2\ndiabetes and CVD independent of the\ncurrent A1C or A1C goal or metformin\ntherapy. Based on these considera-\ntions, the following two strategies are\noffered (70):\n1. If already on dual therapy or multi-\nple glucose-lowering therapies and\nnot on an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1\nreceptor agonist, consider switching\nto one of these agents with proven\ncardiovascular bene\ufb01t.\n2. Introduce SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1\nreceptor agonists in people with CVD\nat A1C goal (independent of met-\nformin) for cardiovascular bene\ufb01t,\nindependent of baseline A1C or in-\ndividualized A1C target.\nSetting and Modifying A1C Goals\nNumerous factors must be considered\nwhen setting glycemic targets. The ADA\nproposes general targets appropriate\nfor many people but emphasizes the\nimportance of individualization based\non key patient characteristics. Glycemic\ntargets must be individualized in the\ncontext of shared decision-making to\naddress individual needs and prefer-\nences and consider characteristics that\nin\ufb02uence risks and bene\ufb01ts of therapy;\nthis approach may optimize engagement\nand self-ef\ufb01cacy.\nThe factors to consider in individualiz-\ning goals are depicted in Fig. 6.2. This \ufb01g-\nure is not designed to be applied rigidly\nbut to be used as a broad construct to\nguide clinical decision-making (71) and\nengage people with type 1 and type 2 di-\nabetes in shared decision-making. More\naggressive targets may be recommended\nif they can be achieved safely and\nwith an acceptable burden of therapy\nand if life expectancy is suf\ufb01cient to\nreap the bene\ufb01ts of stringent targets.\nLess stringent targets (A1C up to 8%\n[64 mmol/mol]) may be recommended\nif the patient\u2019s life expectancy is such\nthat the bene\ufb01ts of an intensive goal\nmay not be realized, or if the risks and\nburdens outweigh the potential bene-\n\ufb01ts. Severe or frequent hypoglycemia\nis an absolute indication for the modi-\n\ufb01cation of treatment plans, including\nsetting higher glycemic goals.\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that pro-\ngresses over decades. Thus, a goal that\nmight be appropriate for an individual\nearly in the course of their diabetes may\nchange over time. Newly diagnosed pa-\ntients and/or those without comorbidities\nthat limit life expectancy may bene\ufb01t\nfrom intensive control proven to prevent\nmicrovascular complications. Both DCCT/\nEDIC and UKPDS demonstrated metabolic\nmemory, or a legacy effect, in which a \ufb01-\nnite period of intensive control yielded\nbene\ufb01ts that extended for decades after\nthat control ended. Thus, a \ufb01nite period\nof intensive control to near-normal A1C\nmay yield enduring bene\ufb01ts even if con-\ntrol is subsequently deintensi\ufb01ed as pa-\ntient characteristics change. Over time,\ncomorbidities may emerge, decreasing life\nexpectancy and thereby decreasing the\npotential to reap bene\ufb01ts from intensive\ncontrol. Also, with longer disease dura-\ntion, diabetes may become more dif\ufb01-\ncult to control, with increasing risks and\nburdens of therapy. Thus, A1C targets\nshould be reevaluated over time to bal-\nance the risks and bene\ufb01ts as patient\nfactors change.\nRecommended glycemic targets for\nmany nonpregnant adults are shown\nin Table 6.3. The recommendations in-\nclude blood glucose levels that appear\nto correlate with achievement of an\nA1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol). Pregnancy\nrecommendations are discussed in more\ndetail in Section 15, \u201cManagement of\nDiabetes in Pregnancy.\u201d\nThe issue of preprandial versus post-\nprandial BGM targets is complex (72,73).\nElevated postchallenge (2-h oral glucose\ntolerance test) glucose values have been\nassociated with increased cardiovascular\nrisk independent of fasting plasma glu-\ncose in some epidemiologic studies,\nwhereas intervention trials have not\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nGlycemic Targets\nS103\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "shown postprandial glucose to be a\ncardiovascular risk factor independent\nof A1C. In people with diabetes, surro-\ngate measures of vascular pathology,\nsuch as endothelial dysfunction, are\nnegatively affected by postprandial hy-\nperglycemia. It is clear that postprandial\nhyperglycemia, like preprandial hyper-\nglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C\nlevels, with its relative contribution\nbeing greater at A1C levels that are\ncloser to 7% (53 mmol/mol). However,\noutcome studies have shown A1C to\nbe the primary predictor of complica-\ntions, and landmark trials of glycemic\ncontrol such as the DCCT and UKPDS\nrelied overwhelmingly on preprandial\nBGM. Additionally, a randomized con-\ntrolled trial in patients with known CVD\nfound no CVD bene\ufb01t of insulin treat-\nment plans targeting postprandial glu-\ncose compared with those targeting\npreprandial glucose (73). Therefore, it\nis reasonable to check postprandial glu-\ncose in individuals who have premeal\nglucose values within target but A1C\nvalues above target. In addition, when\nintensifying insulin therapy, measuring\npostprandial plasma glucose 1\u20132 h af-\nter the start of a meal (using BGM or\nCGM) and using treatments aimed at\nreducing postprandial plasma glucose\nvalues to <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)\nmay help to lower A1C.\nAn analysis of data from 470 partici-\npants in the ADAG study (237 with\ntype 1 diabetes and 147 with type 2\ndiabetes) found that the glucose ranges\nhighlighted in Table 6.1 are adequate\nto meet targets and decrease hypogly-\ncemia (14). These \ufb01ndings support that\npremeal glucose targets may be relaxed\nwithout undermining overall glycemic\ncontrol as measured by A1C. These data\nprompted the revision in the ADA-\nrecommended premeal glucose target\nto 80\u2013130 mg/dL (4.4\u20137.2 mmol/L)\nbut did not affect the de\ufb01nition of\nhypoglycemia.\nHYPOGLYCEMIA\nRecommendations\n6.10 Occurrence and risk for hypogly-\ncemia should be reviewed at ev-\nery encounter and investigated\nas indicated. Awareness of hypo-\nglycemia should be considered\nusing validated tools. C\n6.11 Glucose (approximately 15\u201320 g)\nis the preferred treatment for\nthe conscious individual with\nblood glucose <70 mg/dL (3.9\nmmol/L), although any form of\ncarbohydrate that contains glu-\ncose may be used. Fifteen mi-\nnutes after treatment, if blood\nglucose monitoring (BGM) shows\ncontinued hypoglycemia, the\ntreatment should be repeated.\nOnce the BGM or glucose pat-\ntern is trending up, the individ-\nual should consume a meal or\nsnack to prevent recurrence of\nhypoglycemia. B\n6.12 Glucagon should be prescribed\nfor all individuals at increased\nrisk of level 2 or 3 hypoglyce-\nmia, so that it is available should\nit be needed. Caregivers, school\npersonnel, or family members\nproviding support to these indi-\nviduals should know where it is\nand when and how to admin-\nister it. Glucagon administra-\ntion is not limited to health\ncare professionals. E\n6.13 Hypoglycemia unawareness or\none or more episodes of level 3\nhypoglycemia\nshould\ntrigger\nhypoglycemia avoidance educa-\ntion and reevaluation and ad-\njustment of the treatment plan\nto decrease hypoglycemia. E\n6.14 Insulin-treated patients with hy-\npoglycemia\nunawareness,\none\nlevel 3 hypoglycemic event, or a\npattern of unexplained level 2\nhypoglycemia should be advised\nto raise their glycemic targets\nto strictly avoid hypoglycemia\nfor at least several weeks in or-\nder to partially reverse hypogly-\ncemia unawareness and reduce\nrisk of future episodes. A\n6.15 Ongoing assessment of cogni-\ntive function is suggested with\nincreased vigilance for hypogly-\ncemia by the clinician, patient,\nand caregivers if impaired or\ndeclining cognition is found. B\nHypoglycemia is the major limiting fac-\ntor in the glycemic management of\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recommen-\ndations regarding the classi\ufb01cation of\nhypoglycemia are outlined in Table 6.4\n(74\u201383). Level 1 hypoglycemia is de\ufb01ned\nas a measurable glucose concentration\n<70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) but $54 mg/dL\n(3.0 mmol/L). A blood glucose concentra-\ntion of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) has been\nrecognized as a threshold for neuroendo-\ncrine responses to falling glucose in peo-\nple without diabetes. Because many\npeople with diabetes demonstrate im-\npaired counterregulatory responses to\nhypoglycemia and/or experience hypo-\nglycemia unawareness, a measured glu-\ncose level <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is\nconsidered clinically important (indepen-\ndent of the severity of acute hypoglyce-\nmic symptoms). Level 2 hypoglycemia\n(de\ufb01ned as a blood glucose concentration\n<54 mg/dL [3.0 mmol/L]) is the threshold\nat which neuroglycopenic symptoms be-\ngin to occur and requires immediate ac-\ntion to resolve the hypoglycemic event. If\na patient has level 2 hypoglycemia with-\nout adrenergic or neuroglycopenic symp-\ntoms, they likely have hypoglycemia\nunawareness (discussed further below).\nThis clinical scenario warrants investiga-\ntion and review of the treatment plan\n(75,79). Use Clarke score, Gold score,\nor Pedersen-Bjergaard score to assess\nimpaired awareness (76).

Hypoglycemia may be inconvenient\nor frightening to people with diabetes.\nLevel 3 hypoglycemia may be recognized\nor unrecognized and can progress to loss\nof consciousness, seizure, coma, or death.\nHypoglycemia is reversed by administra-\ntion of rapid-acting glucose or glucagon.\nHypoglycemia can cause acute harm to\nthe person with diabetes or others, espe-\ncially if it causes falls, motor vehicle acci-\ndents, or other injury. Recurrent level 2\nhypoglycemia and/or level 3 hypoglycemia\nis an urgent medical issue and requires in-\ntervention with medical treatment plan\nadjustment, behavioral intervention, and,\nin some cases, use of technology to assist\nwith hypoglycemia prevention and identi-\n\ufb01cation (76,79\u201382). A large cohort study\nsuggested that among older adults with\ntype 2 diabetes, a history of level 3 hy-\npoglycemia was associated with greater\nrisk of dementia (84). Conversely, in a\nsubstudy of the ACCORD trial, cognitive\nimpairment at baseline or decline in\ncognitive function during the trial was\nsigni\ufb01cantly associated with subsequent\nepisodes of level 3 hypoglycemia (85).\nEvidence from DCCT/EDIC, which in-\nvolved adolescents and younger adults\nwith type 1 diabetes, found no asso-\nciation between frequency of level 3\nhypoglycemia and cognitive decline\n(86).\nStudies of rates of level 3 hypoglyce-\nmia that rely on claims data for hospi-\ntalization, emergency department visits,\nand ambulance use substantially under-\nestimate rates of level 3 hypoglycemia\n(87) yet reveal a high burden of hypo-\nglycemia in adults over 60 years of\nage in the community (88). African\nAmerican individuals are at substantially\nincreased risk of level 3 hypoglycemia\n(88,89). In addition to age and race,\nother important risk factors found in\na community-based epidemiologic co-\nhort of older adults with type 2 diabetes\ninclude insulin use, poor or moderate\nversus good glycemic control, albumin-\nuria, and poor cognitive function (88).\nLevel 3 hypoglycemia was associated\nwith mortality in participants in both\nthe standard and the intensive glyce-\nmia arms of the ACCORD trial, but the\nrelationships between hypoglycemia,\nachieved A1C, and treatment intensity\nwere not straightforward. An associa-\ntion of level 3 hypoglycemia with mor-\ntality was also found in the ADVANCE\ntrial (90). An association between self-\nreported level 3 hypoglycemia and 5-year\nmortality has also been reported in clinical\npractice (91). Glucose variability is also\nassociated with an increased risk for\nhypoglycemia (92).\nYoung children with type 1 diabetes\nand the elderly, including those with\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes (84,93), are\nnoted as particularly vulnerable to hy-\npoglycemia because of their reduced\nability to recognize hypoglycemic symp-\ntoms and effectively communicate their\nneeds. Individualized glucose targets,\npatient education, nutrition interven-\ntion (e.g., bedtime snack to prevent\novernight hypoglycemia when speci\ufb01-\ncally needed to treat low blood glu-\ncose), physical activity management,\nmedication adjustment, glucose moni-\ntoring, and routine clinical surveillance\nmay improve patient outcomes (94).\nCGM with automated low glucose sus-\npend and hybrid closed-loop systems\nhave been shown to be effective in re-\nducing hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes\n(95). For people with type 1 diabetes\nwith level 3 hypoglycemia and hypogly-\ncemia unawareness that persists despite\nmedical treatment, human islet trans-\nplantation may be an option, but the ap-\nproach remains experimental (96,97).\nIn 2015, the ADA changed its prepran-\ndial glycemic target from 70\u2013130 mg/dL\n(3.9\u20137.2 mmol/L) to 80\u2013130 mg/dL\n(4.4\u20137.2 mmol/L). This change re\ufb02ects\nthe results of the ADAG study, which\ndemonstrated that higher glycemic tar-\ngets corresponded to A1C goals (14).\nAn additional goal of raising the lower\nrange of the glycemic target was to\nlimit overtreatment and provide a safety\nmargin in patients titrating glucose-\nlowering drugs such as insulin to gly-\ncemic targets.\nHypoglycemia Treatment\nHealth care professionals should con-\ntinue to counsel patients to treat hypo-\nglycemia with fast-acting carbohydrates\nat the hypoglycemia alert value of\n70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or less. This\nshould be reviewed at each patient\nvisit. Hypoglycemia treatment requires\ningestion of glucose- or carbohydrate-\ncontaining foods (98\u2013100). The acute\nglycemic response correlates better with\nthe glucose content of food than with\nthe carbohydrate content of food. Pure\nglucose is the preferred treatment, but\nany form of carbohydrate that contains\nglucose will raise blood glucose. Added\nfat may retard and then prolong the\nacute glycemic response. In type 2 dia-\nbetes, ingested protein may increase insu-\nlin response without increasing plasma\nglucose concentrations (101). Therefore,\ncarbohydrate sources high in protein should\nnot be used to treat or prevent hypogly-\ncemia. Ongoing insulin activity or insulin\nsecretagogues may lead to recurrent hy-\npoglycemia unless more food is ingested\nafter recovery. Once the glucose returns\nto normal, the individual should be coun-\nseled to eat a meal or snack to prevent\nrecurrent hypoglycemia.\nGlucagon\nThe use of glucagon is indicated for the\ntreatment of hypoglycemia in people un-\nable or unwilling to consume carbohy-\ndrates by mouth. Those in close contact\nwith, or having custodial care of, people\nwith hypoglycemia-prone diabetes (fam-\nily members, roommates, school person-\nnel, childcare professionals, correctional\ninstitution staff, or coworkers) should be\ninstructed on the use of glucagon, in-\ncluding where the glucagon product is\nkept and when and how to administer\nit.

In addition to tra-\nditional glucagon injection powder that\nrequires reconstitution prior to injec-\ntion, intranasal glucagon and ready-to-\ninject glucagon preparations for sub-\ncutaneous injection are available and\nmay be bene\ufb01cial in view of safety, ef-\n\ufb01cacy, and ease of use. Care should be\ntaken to ensure that glucagon products\nare not expired (102).\nHypoglycemia Prevention\nHypoglycemia prevention is a critical\ncomponent of diabetes management.\nBGM and, for some individuals, CGM\nare essential tools to assess therapy\nand detect incipient hypoglycemia. Peo-\nple with diabetes should understand sit-\nuations\nthat\nincrease\ntheir\nrisk\nof\nhypoglycemia, such as when fasting for\nlaboratory tests or procedures, when\nmeals are delayed, during and after the\nconsumption of alcohol, during and af-\nter intense physical activity, and during\nsleep. Hypoglycemia may increase the\nrisk of harm to self or others, such as\nwhen driving. Teaching people with dia-\nbetes to balance insulin use and carbo-\nhydrate intake and physical activity are\nnecessary, but these strategies are not\nalways suf\ufb01cient for prevention (77,\n103\u2013105). Formal training programs to\nincrease\nawareness\nof\nhypoglycemia\nand to develop strategies to decrease\nhypoglycemia have been developed, in-\ncluding the Blood Glucose Awareness\nTraining Program, Dose Adjusted for\nNormal Eating (DAFNE), and DAFNE-\nplus. Conversely, some individuals with\ntype 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes and\nhypoglycemia who have a fear of hyper-\nglycemia are resistant to relaxation of\nglycemic targets (74\u201383). Regardless of\nthe factors contributing to hypoglycemia\nand hypoglycemia unawareness, this rep-\nresents an urgent medical issue requiring\nintervention.\nIn type 1 diabetes and severely insulin-\nde\ufb01cient type 2 diabetes, hypoglycemia\nunawareness (or hypoglycemia-associated\nautonomic failure) can severely compro-\nmise stringent diabetes control and qual-\nity of life. This syndrome is characterized\nby de\ufb01cient counterregulatory hormone\nrelease, especially in older adults, and a\ndiminished autonomic response, which\nare both risk factors for and caused by\nhypoglycemia. A corollary to this \u201cvicious\ncycle\u201d is that several weeks of avoidance\nof hypoglycemia has been demonstrated\nto improve counterregulation and hypo-\nglycemia awareness in many people with\ndiabetes (106). Hence, individuals with\none or more episodes of clinically signi\ufb01-\ncant hypoglycemia may bene\ufb01t from at\nleast short-term relaxation of glycemic\ntargets and availability of glucagon (107).\nAny person with recurrent hypoglycemia\nor hypoglycemia unawareness should\nhave their glucose management treat-\nment plan adjusted.\nUse of CGM Technology in Hypoglycemia\nPrevention\nWith the advent of sensor-augmented\nCGM and CGM-assisted pump therapy,\nthere has been a promise of alarm-based\nprevention of hypoglycemia (108,109). To\ndate, there have been a number of ran-\ndomized controlled trials in adults with\ntype 1 diabetes and studies in adults and\nchildren with type 1 diabetes using real-\ntime CGM (see Section 7, \u201cDiabetes\nTechnology\u201d). These studies had differ-\ning A1C at entry and differing primary\nend points and thus must be inter-\npreted carefully. Real-time CGM studies\ncan be divided into studies with ele-\nvated A1C with the primary end point\nof A1C reduction and studies with A1C\nnear target with the primary end\npoint of reduction in hypoglycemia (98,\n109\u2013124). In people with type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes with A1C above target,\nCGM improved A1C between 0.3 and\n0.6%. For studies targeting hypoglyce-\nmia, most studies demonstrated a signi\ufb01-\ncant reduction in time spent between 54\nand 70 mg/dL. A report in people with\ntype 1 diabetes over the age of 60 years\nrevealed a small but statistically signi\ufb01-\ncant decrease in hypoglycemia (125). No\nstudy to date has reported a decrease in\nlevel 3 hypoglycemia. In a single study\nusing intermittently scanned CGM, adults\nwith type 1 diabetes with A1C near goal\nand impaired awareness of hypoglycemia\ndemonstrated no change in A1C and\ndecreased level 2 hypoglycemia (115). For\npeople with type 2 diabetes, studies\nexamining the impact of CGM on hy-\npoglycemic events are limited; a re-\ncent meta-analysis does not re\ufb02ect a\nsigni\ufb01cant impact on hypoglycemic events\nin type 2 diabetes (126), whereas im-\nprovements in A1C were observed in\nmost studies (126\u2013132). Overall, real-\ntime CGM appears to be a useful tool\nfor decreasing time spent in a hypo-\nglycemic range in people with impaired\nawareness. For people with type 2 diabe-\ntes, other strategies to assist them with\ninsulin dosing can improve A1C with\nminimal hypoglycemia (133,134).\nINTERCURRENT ILLNESS\nFor further information on management\nof individuals with hyperglycemia in the\nhospital, see Section 16, \u201cDiabetes Care\nin the Hospital.\u201d\nStressful events (e.g., illness, trauma,\nsurgery) may worsen glycemic control and\nprecipitate diabetic ketoacidosis or nonke-\ntotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state,\nlife-threatening conditions that require im-\nmediate medical care to prevent complica-\ntions and death. Any condition leading to\ndeterioration in glycemic control necessi-\ntates more frequent monitoring of blood\nglucose; ketosis-prone patients also re-\nquire urine or blood ketone monitoring. If\naccompanied by ketosis, vomiting, or al-\nteration in the level of consciousness,\nmarked hyperglycemia requires tempo-\nrary adjustment of the treatment plan\nand immediate interaction with the dia-\nbetes care team. The patient treated with\nnoninsulin therapies or medical nutrition\ntherapy alone may require insulin. Ade-\nquate \ufb02uid and caloric intake must be\nensured. Infection or dehydration are\nmore likely to necessitate hospitaliza-\ntion of individuals with diabetes versus\nthose without diabetes.\nA clinician with expertise in diabetes\nmanagement should treat the hospital-\nized patient. For further information on\nthe management of diabetic ketoacidosis\nand the nonketotic hyperglycemic hyper-\nosmolar state, please refer to the ADA\nconsensus report \u201cHyperglycemic Crises\nin Adult Patients With Diabetes\u201d (134).\nReferences\n1.

Diabetes technology has expanded to include automated\ninsulin delivery (AID) systems, where CGM-informed algorithms modulate insulin de-\nlivery, as well as diabetes self-management support software serving as medical devi-\nces. Diabetes technology, when coupled with education, follow-up, and support, can\nimprove the lives and health of people with diabetes; however, the complexity and\nrapid evolution of the diabetes technology landscape can also be a barrier to imple-\nmentation for both people with diabetes and the health care team.\nGENERAL DEVICE PRINCIPLES\nRecommendations\n7.1\nThe type(s) and selection of devices should be individualized based on a\nperson\u2019s speci\ufb01c needs, preferences, and skill level. In the setting of an\nindividual whose diabetes is partially or wholly managed by someone else\n(e.g., a young child or a person with cognitive impairment or dexterity, psy-\nchosocial, and/or physical limitations), the caregiver\u2019s skills and preferences\nare integral to the decision-making process. E\n7.2\nWhen prescribing a device, ensure that people with diabetes/caregivers\nreceive initial and ongoing education and training, either in-person or\nremotely, and ongoing evaluation of technique, results, and their ability\nto utilize data, including uploading/sharing data (if applicable), to moni-\ntor and adjust therapy.

    "text": "7.3\nPeople with diabetes who have\nbeen using continuous glucose\nmonitoring, continuous sub-\ncutaneous insulin infusion, and/\nor automated insulin delivery\nfor diabetes management should\nhave continued access across\nthird-party payers, regardless\nof age or A1C levels. E\n7.4\nStudents should be supported\nat school in the use of diabetes\ntechnology, such as continuous\nglucose monitoring systems,\ncontinuous subcutaneous in-\nsulin infusion, connected insu-\nlin pens, and automated insulin\ndelivery systems, as prescribed\nby their health care team. E\n7.5\nInitiation of continuous glucose\nmonitoring, continuous subcu-\ntaneous insulin infusion, and/or\nautomated insulin delivery early\nin the treatment of diabetes can\nbe bene\ufb01cial depending on a\nperson\u2019s/caregiver\u2019s needs and\npreferences. C\nTechnology is rapidly changing, but there\nis no \u201cone-size-\ufb01ts-all\u201d approach to tech-\nnology use in people with diabetes. In-\nsurance coverage can lag behind device\navailability, patient interest in devices\nand willingness for adoption can vary,\nand health care teams may have chal-\nlenges keeping up with newly released\ntechnology. An American Diabetes Asso-\nciation resource, which can be accessed\nat consumerguide.diabetes.org, can help\nhealth care professionals and people\nwith diabetes make decisions as to the\ninitial choice of devices. Other sources,\nincluding health care professionals and\ndevice manufacturers, can help people\ntroubleshoot when dif\ufb01culties arise.\nEducation and Training\nIn general, no device used in diabetes\nmanagement works optimally without\neducation, training, and ongoing support.\nThere are multiple resources for online\ntutorials and training videos as well as\nwritten material on the use of devices.\nPeople with diabetes vary in comfort level\nwith technology, and some prefer in-person\ntraining and support. Those with more edu-\ncation regarding device use have better\noutcomes (1,2); therefore, the need for\nadditional education should be periodically\nassessed, particularly if outcomes are not\nbeing met.\nUse in Schools\nInstructions for device use should be\noutlined in the student\u2019s diabetes medi-\ncal management plan (DMMP). A backup\nplan should be included in the DMMP\nfor potential device failure (e.g., BGM,\nCGM, and/or insulin delivery devices).\nSchool nurses and designees should\ncomplete training to stay up to date on\ndiabetes technologies prescribed for use\nin the school setting. Updated resources\nto support diabetes care at school, in-\ncluding training materials and a DMMP\ntemplate, can be found online at diabetes.\norg/safeatschool.\nInitiation of Device Use\nThe use of CGM devices should be con-\nsidered from the outset of the diagnosis\nof diabetes that requires insulin manage-\nment (3,4). This allows for close tracking\nof glucose levels with adjustments of\ninsulin dosing and lifestyle modi\ufb01cations\nand removes the burden of frequent BGM.\nIn addition, early CGM initiation after diag-\nnosis of type 1 diabetes in youth has been\nshown to decrease A1C and is associated\nwith high parental satisfaction and reliance\non this technology for diabetes manage-\nment (5,6). In appropriate individuals, early\nuse of AID systems or insulin pumps may\nbe considered. Interruption of access to\nCGM is associated with a worsening of\noutcomes (7,8); therefore, it is important\nfor individuals on CGM to have consis-\ntent access to devices.\nBLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING\nRecommendations\n7.6\nPeople with diabetes should be\nprovided with blood glucose\nmonitoring devices as indicated\nby their circumstances, prefer-\nences, and treatment. People\nusing continuous glucose moni-\ntoring devices must also have\naccess to blood glucose moni-\ntoring at all times. A\n7.7\nPeople who are on insulin\nusing blood glucose monitor-\ning should be encouraged to\ncheck their blood glucose lev-\nels when appropriate based\non their insulin therapy. This\nmay include checking when\nfasting, prior to meals and\nsnacks, after meals, at bedtime,\nprior to exercise, when hypo-\nglycemia is suspected, after\ntreating low blood glucose\nlevels until they are normo-\nglycemic, when hyperglycemia\nis suspected, and prior to and\nwhile performing critical tasks\nsuch as driving. B\n7.8\nHealth care professionals should\nbe aware of the differences in\naccuracy among blood glucose\nmeters\u2014only meters approved\nby the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (or comparable\nregulatory agencies for other\ngeographical locations) with\nproven accuracy should be used,\nwith unexpired strips purchased\nfrom a pharmacy or licensed\ndistributor. E\n7.9\nAlthough blood glucose monitor-\ning in individuals on noninsulin\ntherapies has not consistently\nshown clinically signi\ufb01cant re-\nductions in A1C, it may be help-\nful when altering nutrition plan,\nphysical activity, and/or medi-\ncations (particularly medications\nthat can cause hypoglycemia)\nin conjunction with a treat-\nment adjustment program. E\n7.10\nHealth care professionals should\nbe aware of medications and\nother factors, such as high-dose\nvitamin C and hypoxemia, that\ncan interfere with glucose meter\naccuracy and provide clinical\nmanagement as indicated. E\nMajor clinical trials of insulin-treated peo-\nple with diabetes have included BGM as\npart of multifactorial interventions to dem-\nonstrate the bene\ufb01t of intensive glycemic\nmanagement on diabetes complications\n(9). BGM is thus an integral component of\neffective therapy of individuals taking insulin.\nIn recent years, CGM has emerged as a\nmethod for the assessment of glucose lev-\nels (discussed below). Glucose monitoring\nallows people with diabetes to evaluate\ntheir individual response to therapy and\nassess whether glycemic targets are being\nsafely achieved. Integrating results into\ndiabetes management can be a useful\ntool for guiding medical nutrition therapy\nand physical activity, preventing hypoglyce-\nmia, or adjusting medications (particularly\nS112\nDiabetes Technology\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "prandial insulin doses). The speci\ufb01c needs\nand goals of the person with diabetes\nshould dictate BGM frequency and timing\nor the consideration of CGM use. As rec-\nommended by the device manufacturers\nand the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA), people with diabetes using\nCGM must have access to BGM for mul-\ntiple reasons, including whenever there\nis suspicion that the CGM is inaccurate,\nwhile waiting for warm-up, for calibration\n(some sensors) or if a warning mes-\nsage appears, and in any clinical set-\nting where glucose levels are changing\nrapidly (>2 mg/dL/min), which could cause\na discrepancy between CGM and blood\nglucose.\nMeter Standards\nGlucose meters meeting FDA guidance\nfor meter accuracy provide the most re-\nliable data for diabetes management.\nThere are several current standards for\nthe accuracy of blood glucose meters,\nbut the two most used are those of the\nInternational Organization for Standardi-\nzation (ISO) (ISO 15197:2013) and the\nFDA. The current ISO and FDA standards\nare compared in Table 7.1. In Europe,\ncurrently marketed meters must meet\ncurrent ISO standards. In the U.S., cur-\nrently marketed meters must meet the\nstandard under which they were ap-\nproved, which may not be the current\nstandard. Moreover, the monitoring of\ncurrent accuracy post-marketing is left\nto the manufacturer and not routinely\nchecked by an independent source.\nPeople with diabetes assume their\nglucose meter is accurate because it is\nFDA cleared, but that may not be the\ncase. There is substantial variation in the\naccuracy of widely used BGM systems\n(10,11). The Diabetes Technology Soci-\nety Blood Glucose Monitoring System\nSurveillance Program provides information\non the performance of devices used for\nBGM (diabetestechnology.org/surveillance/).\nIn one analysis, 6 of the top 18 glucose\nmeters met the accuracy standard (12).\nIn a subsequent analysis with updated\nglucose meters, 14 of 18 glucose meters\nmet the minimum accuracy requirements\n(13). There are single-meter studies in\nwhich bene\ufb01ts have been found with\nindividual meter systems, but few studies\nhave compared meters head-to-head.\nCertain meter system characteristics, such\nas the use of lancing devices that are less\npainful (14) and the ability to reapply\nblood to a strip with an insuf\ufb01cient initial\nsample, may also be bene\ufb01cial to people\nwith diabetes (15) and may make BGM\nless burdensome to perform.\nCounterfeit Strips\nPeople with diabetes should be advised\nagainst purchasing or reselling preowned\nor secondhand test strips, as these may\ngive incorrect results. Only unopened\nand unexpired vials of glucose test strips\nshould be used to ensure BGM accuracy.\nOptimizing Blood Glucose\nMonitoring Device Use\nOptimal use of BGM devices requires\nproper review and interpretation of data\nby both the person with diabetes and\nthe health care professional to ensure\nthat data are used in an effective and\ntimely manner. In people with type 1\ndiabetes, there is a correlation between\ngreater BGM frequency and lower A1C\n(16). Among those who check their blood\nglucose at least once daily, many report\ntaking no action when results are high or\nlow (17). Some meters now provide ad-\nvice to the user in real time when moni-\ntoring glucose levels (18), whereas others\ncan be used as a part of integrated health\nplatforms (19). People with diabetes\nshould be taught how to use BGM data\nto adjust food intake, physical activity,\nor pharmacologic therapy to achieve\nspeci\ufb01c goals. The ongoing need for and\nfrequency of BGM should be reevaluated\nat each routine visit to ensure its effec-\ntive use (17,20,21).\nPeople With Diabetes on Intensive Insulin\nTherapies\nBGM is especially important for people\nwith diabetes treated with insulin to\nmonitor for and prevent hypoglycemia\nand hyperglycemia. Most individuals on\nintensive insulin therapies (multiple daily\ninjections [MDI] or insulin pump therapy)\nshould be encouraged to assess glucose\nlevels using BGM (and/or CGM) prior to\nmeals and snacks, at bedtime, occasion-\nally postprandially, prior to physical activ-\nity, when they suspect hypoglycemia or\nhyperglycemia, after treating hypoglyce-\nmia until they are normoglycemic, and\nprior to and while performing critical\ntasks such as driving. For many individu-\nals using BGM, this requires checking up\nto 6\u201310 times daily, although individual\nneeds may vary. A database study of\nalmost 27,000 children and adolescents\nwith type 1 diabetes showed that, after\nadjusting for multiple confounders, in-\ncreased daily frequency of BGM was\nsigni\ufb01cantly associated with lower A1C\n(\u00010.2% per additional check per day) and\nwith fewer acute complications (22).\nPeople With Diabetes Using Basal Insulin\nand/or Oral Agents and Noninsulin\nInjectables\nThe evidence is insuf\ufb01cient regarding\nwhen to prescribe BGM and how often\nmonitoring is needed for insulin-treated\npeople with diabetes who do not use in-\ntensive insulin therapy, such as those\nTable 7.1\u2014Comparison of ISO 15197:2013 and FDA blood glucose meter accuracy standards\nSetting\nFDA (248,254)\nISO 15197:2013 (255)\nHome use\n95% within 15% for all BG in the usable BG range\u2020\n99% within 20% for all BG in the usable BG range\u2020\n95% within 15% for BG $100 mg/dL\n95% within 15 mg/dL for BG <100 mg/dL\n99% in A or B region of consensus error grid\u2021\nHospital use\n95% within 12% for BG $75 mg/dL\n95% within 12 mg/dL for BG <75 mg/dL\n98% within 15% for BG $75 mg/dL\n98% within 15 mg/dL for BG <75 mg/dL\nBG, blood glucose; FDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration; ISO, International Organization for Standardization.

    "text": "with type 2 diabetes taking basal insulin\nwith or without oral agents and/or non-\ninsulin injectables. However, for those\ntaking basal insulin, assessing fasting glu-\ncose with BGM to inform dose adjust-\nments to achieve blood glucose targets\nresults in lower A1C (23,24).\nIn people with type 2 diabetes not\ntaking insulin, routine glucose monitor-\ning may be of limited additional clinical\nbene\ufb01t. By itself, even when combined\nwith education, it has shown limited im-\nprovement in outcomes (25\u201328). However,\nfor some individuals, glucose monitoring\ncan provide insight into the impact of\nnutrition, physical activity, and medication\nmanagement on glucose levels. Glucose\nmonitoring may also be useful in assess-\ning hypoglycemia, glucose levels during\nintercurrent illness, or discrepancies be-\ntween measured A1C and glucose levels\nwhen there is concern an A1C result may\nnot be reliable in speci\ufb01c individuals. It\nmay be useful when coupled with a treat-\nment adjustment program. In a year-long\nstudy of insulin-naive people with diabetes\nwith suboptimal initial glycemic outcomes,\na group trained in structured BGM (a\npaper tool was used at least quarterly\nto collect and interpret seven-point BGM\npro\ufb01les taken on 3 consecutive days) re-\nduced their A1C by 0.3% more than the\ncontrol group (29). A trial of once-daily\nBGM that included enhanced feedback\nfrom people with diabetes through mes-\nsaging found no clinically or statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant change in A1C at 1 year (28).\nMeta-analyses have suggested that BGM\ncan reduce A1C by 0.25\u20130.3% at 6 months\n(30\u201332), but the effect was attenuated at\n12 months in one analysis (30). Reduc-\ntions in A1C were greater (\u00010.3%) in tri-\nals where structured BGM data were\nused to adjust medications, but A1C was\nnot changed signi\ufb01cantly without such\nstructured diabetes therapy adjustment\n(32). A key consideration is that perform-\ning BGM alone does not lower blood glu-\ncose levels. To be useful, the information\nmust be integrated into clinical and self-\nmanagement plans.\nGlucose Meter Inaccuracy\nAlthough many meters function well under\nvarious circumstances, health care profes-\nsionals and people with diabetes must be\naware of factors impairing meter accuracy.\nA meter reading that seems discordant\nwith the clinical picture needs to be re-\ntested or tested in a laboratory. Health\ncare professionals in intensive care unit\nsettings need to be particularly aware of\nthe potential for abnormal meter readings\nduring critical illness, and laboratory-based\nvalues should be used if there is any\ndoubt.\nSome meters give error messages if\nmeter readings are likely to be false (33).\nOxygen. Currently available glucose mon-\nitors utilize an enzymatic reaction linked\nto an electrochemical reaction, either\nglucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase\n(34). Glucose oxidase monitors are sensi-\ntive to the oxygen available and should\nonly be used with capillary blood in people\nwith normal oxygen saturation. Higher oxy-\ngen tensions (i.e., arterial blood or oxygen\ntherapy) may result in false low glucose\nreadings, and low oxygen tensions (i.e.,\nhigh altitude, hypoxia, or venous blood\nreadings) may lead to false high glucose\nreadings. Glucose dehydrogenase\u2013based\nmonitors are not sensitive to oxygen.\nTemperature. Because the reaction is sen-\nsitive to temperature, all monitors have an\nacceptable temperature range (34). Most\nwill show an error if the temperature is\nunacceptable, but a few will provide a\nreading and a message indicating that\nthe value may be incorrect. Humidity and\naltitude may also alter glucose readings.\nInterfering Substances. There are a few\nphysiologic and pharmacologic factors that\ninterfere with glucose readings. Most inter-\nfere only with glucose oxidase systems\n(34). They are listed in Table 7.2.\nCONTINUOUS GLUCOSE\nMONITORING DEVICES\nRecommendations\n7.11\nReal-time continuous glucose\nmonitoring A or intermittently\nscanned continuous glucose\nmonitoring B should be offered\nfor diabetes management in\nadults with diabetes on mul-\ntiple daily injections or con-\ntinuous subcutaneous insulin\ninfusion who are capable of us-\ning the devices safely (either by\nthemselves or with a care-\ngiver).

The choice of device\nshould be made based on the\nindividual\u2019s circumstances, pre-\nferences, and needs.\n7.13\nReal-time continuous glucose\nmonitoring B or intermittently\nscanned continuous glucose\nmonitoring E should be of-\nfered for diabetes manage-\nment in youth with type 1\ndiabetes on multiple daily in-\njections or continuous subcu-\ntaneous insulin infusion who\nare capable of using the devi-\nces safely (either by them-\nselves or with a caregiver).\nThe choice of device should\nbe made based on the indi-\nvidual\u2019s circumstances, pref-\nerences, and needs.\n7.14\nReal-time continuous glucose\nmonitoring or intermittently\nscanned continuous glucose\nmonitoring should be offered\nfor diabetes management in\nyouth with type 2 diabetes\non multiple daily injections or\ncontinuous subcutaneous in-\nsulin infusion who are capable\nof using the devices safely\n(either by themselves or with\na caregiver).

A Intermittently scanned\ncontinuous glucose monitor-\ning devices should be scanned\nfrequently, at a minimum once\nevery 8 h. A People with dia-\nbetes should have uninter-\nrupted access to their supplies\nto minimize gaps in continuous\nglucose monitoring. A\n7.16\nWhen used as an adjunct to\npre- and postprandial blood\nglucose monitoring, continu-\nous glucose monitoring can\nhelp to achieve A1C targets\nin diabetes and pregnancy. B\n7.17\nPeriodic use of real-time or\nintermittently scanned contin-\nuous glucose monitoring or\nuse of professional continuous\nglucose monitoring can be\nhelpful for diabetes manage-\nment in circumstances where\ncontinuous use of continuous\nglucose monitoring is not appro-\npriate, desired, or available. C\n7.18\nSkin reactions, either due to ir-\nritation or allergy, should be\nassessed and addressed to aid\nin successful use of devices. E\n7.19\nContinuous glucose monitoring\ndevice users should be edu-\ncated on potential interfering\nsubstances and other factors\nthat may affect accuracy. C\nCGM measures interstitial glucose (which\ncorrelates well with plasma glucose,\nalthough at times, it can lag if glucose\nlevels are rising or falling rapidly). There\nare two basic types of CGM devices:\nthose that are owned by the user, un-\nblinded, and intended for frequent/con-\ntinuous use, including real-time CGM\n(rtCGM) and intermittently scanned CGM\n(isCGM), and professional CGM devices\nthat are owned and applied in the clinic,\nwhich provide data that are blinded or\nunblinded for a discrete period of time.\nThe types of sensors currently available\nare either disposable (rtCGM and isCGM)\nor implantable (rtCGM). Table 7.3 pro-\nvides the de\ufb01nitions for the types of\nCGM devices. For people with type 1 di-\nabetes using CGM, frequency of sensor\nuse was an important predictor of A1C\nlowering for all age-groups (35,36). The\nfrequency of scanning with isCGM devi-\nces was also correlated with improved\noutcomes (37\u201340).\nSome real-time systems require cali-\nbration by the user, which varies in\nfrequency depending on the device. Ad-\nditionally, some CGM systems are called\n\u201cadjunctive,\u201d meaning the user should\nperform BGM for making treatment deci-\nsions such as dosing insulin or treating\nhypoglycemia. Devices that do not have\nthis requirement outside of certain clinical\nsituations (see BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING\nabove) are called \u201cnonadjunctive\u201d (41\u201343).\nOne speci\ufb01c isCGM device (FreeStyle\nLibre 2 [no generic form available]) and\ntwo speci\ufb01c rtCGM devices (Dexcom G6\n[no generic form available] and FreeStyle\nLibre 3 [no generic form available]) have\nbeen designated as integrated CGM\n(iCGM) devices (44). This is a higher\nstandard set by the FDA so that these\ndevices can be integrated with other\ndigitally connected devices. Presently,\nalthough the Medtronic Guardian 3 rtCGM\n(no generic available) is FDA approved\nfor use with the 670/770G AID systems,\nDexcom G6 rtCGM is the only system\nwith iCGM designation and FDA approval\nfor use with AID systems.\nBenefits of Continuous Glucose\nMonitoring\nData From Randomized Controlled Trials\nMultiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\nhave been performed using rtCGM devices,\nand the results have largely been positive\nin terms of reducing A1C levels and/or\nepisodes of hypoglycemia as long as\nparticipants regularly wore the devices\n(35,36,45\u201367). The initial studies were\nprimarily done in adults and youth with\ntype 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy\nand/or MDI (35,36,45\u201348,51\u201361). The pri-\nmary outcome was met and showed ben-\ne\ufb01t in adults of all ages (35,45,46,51,52,54,\n56,57,68\u201371) including seniors (53,72,73).\nData in children are less consistent; how-\never, rtCGM in young children with type 1\ndiabetes reduced hypoglycemia; in addi-\ntion, behavioral support in parents of\nyoung children with diabetes using\nrtCGM showed the bene\ufb01ts of reducing\nhypoglycemia concerns and diabetes dis-\ntress (35,60,74). Similarly, A1C reduction\nwas seen in adolescents and young\nadults with type 1 diabetes using rtCGM\n(59). RCT data on rtCGM use in individu-\nals with type 2 diabetes on MDI (63),\nmixed therapies (64,65), and basal in-\nsulin (66,75) have consistently shown\nreductions in A1C but not a reduction\nin rates of hypoglycemia. The improve-\nments in type 2 diabetes have largely\noccurred without changes in insulin doses\nor other diabetes medications. CGM dis-\ncontinuation in individuals with type 2\ndiabetes on basal insulin caused partial\nreversal of A1C reduction and time in\nrange (TIR) improvements, suggesting that\ncontinued CGM use achieves the greatest\nbene\ufb01ts (8).\nRCT data for isCGM is more limited.\nOne study was performed in adults with\nTable 7.3\u2014Continuous glucose monitoring devices\nType of CGM\nDescription\nrtCGM\nCGM systems that measure and display glucose levels continuously\nisCGM with and without alarms\nCGM systems that measure glucose levels continuously but require scanning for visualization and storage of\nglucose values\nProfessional CGM\nCGM devices that are placed on the person with diabetes in the health care professional\u2019s of\ufb01ce (or with remote\ninstruction) and worn for a discrete period of time (generally 7\u201314 days).

A re-\ncent randomized trial of adults with type 1\ndiabetes showed that the use of iCGM\nwith optional alerts and alarms resulted in\nreduction of A1C compared with BGM use\n(80).\nObservational and Real-World Studies\nisCGM has been widely available in many\ncountries for people with diabetes, and\nthis allows for the collection of large\namounts of data across groups of people\nwith diabetes. In adults with diabetes,\nthese data include results from obser-\nvational studies, retrospective studies,\nand analyses of registry and population\ndata (81,82). In individuals with type 1\ndiabetes wearing isCGM devices, most\n(40,81,83), but not all (84), studies have\nshown improvement in A1C levels. Re-\nductions in acute diabetes complications,\nsuch as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), epi-\nsodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetes-\nrelated coma, and hospitalizations for\nhypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, have\nbeen observed (40,84,85). Some retro-\nspective/observational data have shown\nan improvement in A1C levels for adults\nwith type 2 diabetes on MDI (86), basal\ninsulin (87), and basal insulin or noninsulin\ntherapies (88). In a retrospective study of\nadults with type 2 diabetes taking insulin,\na reduction in acute diabetes-related events\nand all-cause hospitalizations was seen\n(89). Results of self-reported outcomes\nvaried, but where measured, people with\ndiabetes had an increase in treatment\nsatisfaction when comparing isCGM with\nBGM.\nIn an observational study in youth with\ntype 1 diabetes, a slight increase in A1C\nand weight was seen, but the device was\nassociated with a high user satisfaction\nrate (82).\nRetrospective data from rtCGM use in\na Veterans Affairs population (90) with\ntype 1 and type 2 diabetes treated with\ninsulin showed that the use of rtCGM\nsigni\ufb01cantly lowered A1C and reduced\nrates of emergency department visits or\nhospitalizations for hypoglycemia but did\nnot signi\ufb01cantly lower overall rates of\nemergency department visits, hospitaliza-\ntions, or hyperglycemia.\nReal-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring\nCompared With Intermittently Scanned\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring\nIn adults with type 1 diabetes, three RCTs\nhave been done comparing isCGM and\nrtCGM (91\u201393). In two of the studies, the\nprimary outcome was a reduction in\ntime spent in hypoglycemia, and rtCGM\nshowed bene\ufb01t compared with isCGM\n(91,92). In the other study, the primary\noutcome was improved TIR, and rtCGM\nalso showed bene\ufb01t compared with\nisCGM (93). A retrospective analysis also\nshowed improvement in TIR, comparing\nrtCGM with isCGM (94).\nData Analysis\nThe abundance of data provided by CGM\noffers opportunities to analyze data for\npeople with diabetes more granularly\nthan previously possible, providing addi-\ntional information to aid in achieving\nglycemic targets. A variety of metrics have\nbeen proposed (95) and are discussed in\nSection 6, \u201cGlycemic Targets.\u201d CGM is es-\nsential for creating an ambulatory glucose\npro\ufb01le and providing data on TIR, percent-\nage of time spent above and below range,\nand glycemic variability (96).\nReal-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring\nDevice Use in Pregnancy\nOne well-designed RCT showed a reduc-\ntion in A1C levels in adult women with\ntype 1 diabetes on MDI or insulin pump\ntherapy who were pregnant and using\nrtCGM in addition to standard care, in-\ncluding optimization of pre- and post-\nprandial glucose targets (97). This study\ndemonstrated the value of rtCGM in\npregnancy complicated by type 1 diabe-\ntes by showing a mild improvement in\nA1C without an increase in hypoglycemia\nand reductions in large-for-gestational-age\nbirths, length of stay, and neonatal hypo-\nglycemia (97). An observational cohort\nstudy that evaluated the glycemic vari-\nables reported using rtCGM and isCGM\nfound that lower mean glucose, lower\nstandard deviation, and a higher percentage\nof time in target range were associated\nwith lower risk of large-for-gestational-age\nbirths and other adverse neonatal out-\ncomes (98). Use of the rtCGM-reported\nmean glucose is superior to use of glu-\ncose management indicator (GMI) and\nother calculations to estimate A1C given\nthe changes to A1C that occur in preg-\nnancy (99). Two studies employing in-\ntermittent use of rtCGM showed no\ndifference in neonatal outcomes in women\nwith type 1 diabetes (100) or gestational\ndiabetes mellitus (101).\nUse of Professional and Intermittent\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring\nProfessional CGM devices, which provide\nretrospective data, either blinded or\nunblinded, for analysis, can be used to\nidentify patterns of hypoglycemia and\nhyperglycemia (102,103). Professional CGM\ncan be helpful to evaluate individuals when\neither rtCGM or isCGM is not available\nto the individual or they prefer a blinded\nanalysis or a shorter experience with un-\nblinded data. It can be particularly use-\nful to evaluate periods of hypoglycemia\nin individuals on agents that can cause\nhypoglycemia in order to make medica-\ntion dose adjustments. It can also be\nuseful to evaluate individuals for peri-\nods of hyperglycemia.\nSome data have shown the bene\ufb01t of\nintermittent use of CGM (rtCGM or\nisCGM) in individuals with type 2 diabetes\non noninsulin and/or basal insulin thera-\npies (64,104). In these RCTs, people with\ntype 2 diabetes not on intensive insulin\ntherapy used CGM intermittently com-\npared with those randomized to BGM.\nBoth early (64) and late improvements\nin A1C were found (64,104).\nUse of professional or intermittent\nCGM should always be coupled with anal-\nysis and interpretation for people with di-\nabetes, along with education as needed\nto adjust medication and change lifestyle\nbehaviors (105\u2013107).\nSide Effects of Continuous Glucose\nMonitoring Devices\nContact dermatitis (both irritant and al-\nlergic) has been reported with all devi-\nces that attach to the skin (108\u2013110).

    "text": "some cases, this has been linked to the\npresence of isobornyl acrylate, a skin\nsensitizer that can cause an additional\nspreading allergic reaction (111\u2013113).\nPatch testing can sometimes identify\nthe cause of contact dermatitis (114).\nIdentifying and eliminating tape allergens\nis important to ensure the comfortable\nuse of devices and promote self-care\n(115\u2013118). In some instances, using an\nimplanted sensor can help avoid skin reac-\ntions in those sensitive to tape (119,120).\nSubstances and Factors Affecting\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring Accuracy\nSensor interference due to several medi-\ncations/substances is a known potential\nsource of CGM measurement errors\n(Table 7.4). While several of these sub-\nstances have been reported in the various\nCGM brands\u2019 user manuals, additional\ninterferences have been discovered after\nthe market release of these products. Hy-\ndroxyurea, used for myeloproliferative dis-\norders and hematologic conditions, is one\nof the most recently identi\ufb01ed interfer-\ning substances that cause a temporary\nincrease in sensor glucose values discrepant\nfrom actual glucose values (121\u2013126).\nTherefore, it is crucial to routinely review\nthe medication list of the person with di-\nabetes to identify possible interfering\nsubstances and advise them accordingly\non the need to use additional BGM if sen-\nsor values are unreliable due to these\nsubstances.\nINSULIN DELIVERY\nInsulin Syringes and Pens\nRecommendations\n7.20\nFor people with insulin-requiring\ndiabetes on multiple daily injec-\ntions, insulin pens are preferred\nin most cases. Still, insulin\nsyringes may be used for insu-\nlin delivery considering individ-\nual and caregiver preference,\ninsulin type, dosing therapy,\ncost, and self-management\ncapabilities. C\n7.21\nInsulin pens or insulin injection\naids should be considered for\npeople with dexterity issues or\nvision impairment to facilitate\nthe accurate dosing and ad-\nministration of insulin. C\n7.22\nConnected insulin pens can be\nhelpful for diabetes manage-\nment and may be used in\npeople with diabetes using\ninjectable therapy. E\n7.23\nU.S. Food and Drug Adminis-\ntration\u2013approved insulin dose\ncalculators/decision support sys-\ntems may be helpful for titrat-\ning insulin doses. C\nInjecting insulin with a syringe or pen\n(127\u2013143) is the insulin delivery method\nused by most people with diabetes\n(134,144), although inhaled insulin is\nalso available. Others use insulin pumps or\nAID devices (see INSULIN PUMPS AND AUTOMATED\nINSULIN DELIVERY SYSTEMS). For people with dia-\nbetes who use insulin, insulin syringes\nand pens are both able to deliver insulin\nsafely and effectively for the achievement\nof glycemic targets. Individual preferences,\ncost, insulin type, dosing therapy, and\nself-management capabilities should be\nconsidered when choosing among delivery\nsystems. Trials with insulin pens generally\nshow equivalence or small improvements\nin glycemic outcomes compared with us-\ning a vial and syringe. Many individuals\nwith diabetes prefer using a pen due to its\nsimplicity and convenience. It is important\nto note that while many insulin types are\navailable for purchase as either pens or\nvials, others may be available in only one\nform or the other, and there may be signif-\nicant cost differences between pens and\nvials (see Table 9.4 for a list of insulin\nproduct costs with dosage forms). Insulin\npens may allow people with vision im-\npairment or dexterity issues to dose\ninsulin accurately (145\u2013147), and insulin\ninjection aids are also available to\nhelp with these issues. (For a helpful\nlist of injection aids, see consumerguide.\ndiabetes.org/collections/injection-aids). In-\nhaled insulin can be useful in people who\nhave an aversion to injection.\nThe most common syringe sizes are\n1 mL, 0.5 mL, and 0.3 mL, allowing doses\nof up to 100 units, 50 units, and 30 units\nof U-100 insulin, respectively. In a few\nparts of the world, insulin syringes still\nhave U-80 and U-40 markings for older\ninsulin concentrations and veterinary in-\nsulin, and U-500 syringes are available\nfor the use of U-500 insulin. Syringes are\ngenerally used once but may be reused\nby the same individual in resource-limited\nsettings with appropriate storage and\ncleansing (147).\nInsulin pens offer added convenience\nby combining the vial and syringe into a\nsingle device. Insulin pens, allowing push-\nbutton injections, come as disposable\npens with pre\ufb01lled cartridges or reusable\ninsulin pens with replaceable insulin car-\ntridges. Pens vary with respect to dosing\nincrement and minimal dose, ranging\nfrom half-unit doses to 2-unit dose in-\ncrements. U-500 pens come in 5-unit\ndose increments. Some reusable pens\ninclude a memory function, which can\nrecall dose amounts and timing. Con-\nnected insulin pens are insulin pens with\nthe capacity to record and/or transmit in-\nsulin dose data. Insulin pen caps are also\navailable and are placed on existing insulin\nTable 7.4\u2014Continuous glucose monitoring devices interfering substances\nMedication\nSystems affected\nEffect\nAcetaminophen\n>4 g/day\nDexcom G6\nHigher sensor readings than actual glucose\nAny dose\nMedtronic Guardian\nHigher sensor readings than actual glucose\nAlcohol\nMedtronic Guardian\nSensor readings may be higher than actual glucose\nAscorbic acid (vitamin C), >500 mg/day\nFreeStyle Libre\nHigher sensor readings than actual glucose\nHydroxyurea\nDexcom G6, Medtronic Guardian\nHigher sensor readings than actual glucose\nMannitol\nSenseonics Eversense\nSensor bias within therapeutic concentration ranges\nTetracycline\nSenseonics Eversense\nSensor bias within therapeutic concentration ranges\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nDiabetes Technology\nS117\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

These pens and pen caps\nare useful to people with diabetes for\nreal-time insulin dosing and allow clini-\ncians to retrospectively review the insu-\nlin delivery times and in some cases\ndoses and glucose data in order to\nmake informed insulin dose adjustments\n(148).\nNeedle thickness (gauge) and length\nare other considerations. Needle gauges\nrange from 22 to 34, with a higher gauge\nindicating a thinner needle. A thicker\nneedle can give a dose of insulin more\nquickly, while a thinner needle may cause\nless pain. Needle length ranges from 4 to\n12.7 mm, with some evidence suggesting\nshorter needles (4\u20135 mm) lower the risk\nof intramuscular injection and possibly the\ndevelopment of lipohypertrophy.

A\n7.27\nIndividuals with diabetes who\nhave been using continuous\nsubcutaneous insulin infusion\nshould have continued access\nacross third-party payers. E\nInsulin Pumps\nInsulin pumps have been available in the\nU.S. for over 40 years. These devices de-\nliver rapid-acting insulin throughout the\nday to help manage blood glucose levels.\nMost insulin pumps use tubing to deliver\ninsulin through a cannula, while a few at-\ntach directly to the skin without tubing.\nAID systems, which can adjust insulin deliv-\nery rates based on current sensor glucose\nvalues, are preferred over nonautomated\npumps and MDI in people with type 1\ndiabetes.\nMost studies comparing MDI with insu-\nlin pump therapy have been relatively\nsmall and of short duration. However,\na systematic review and meta-analysis\nconcluded that pump therapy has modest\nadvantages for lowering A1C (\u00010.30%\n[95% CI \u00010.58 to \u00010.02]) and for reduc-\ning severe hypoglycemia rates in children\nand adults (155). There is no consensus\nto guide choosing which form of insulin\nadministration is best for a given individ-\nual, and research to guide this decision-\nmaking process is needed (155). Thus, the\nchoice of MDI or an insulin pump is often\nbased upon the characteristics of the per-\nson with diabetes and which method is\nmost likely to bene\ufb01t them. DiabetesWise\n(DiabetesWise.org) and the PANTHER\nProgram (pantherprogram.org) have help-\nful websites to assist health care profes-\nsionals and people with diabetes in\nchoosing diabetes devices based on\ntheir individual needs and the features\nof the devices. Newer systems, such as\nsensor-augmented pumps and AID sys-\ntems, are discussed below.\nAdoption of pump therapy in the U.S.\nshows geographical variations, which\nmay be related to health care profes-\nsional preference or center characteris-\ntics (157,158) and socioeconomic status,\nas pump therapy is more common in in-\ndividuals of higher socioeconomic status\nas re\ufb02ected by race/ethnicity, private\nhealth insurance, family income, and\neducation (157,158). Given the additional\nbarriers to optimal diabetes care ob-\nserved in disadvantaged groups (159),\naddressing the differences in access to\ninsulin pumps and other diabetes tech-\nnology may contribute to fewer health\ndisparities.\nPump therapy can be successfully\nstarted at the time of diagnosis (160,161).\nPractical aspects of pump therapy initia-\ntion include assessment of readiness of\nthe person with diabetes and their family,\nif applicable (although there is no consen-\nsus on which factors to consider in adults\n[162] or children and adolescents with di-\nabetes), selection of pump type and initial\npump settings, individual/family education\non potential pump complications (e.g.,\nDKA with infusion set failure), transition\nfrom MDI, and introduction of advanced\npump settings (e.g., temporary basal rates,\nextended/square/dual wave bolus).\nOlder individuals with type 1 diabetes\nbene\ufb01t from ongoing insulin pump ther-\napy. There are no data to suggest that\nmeasurement of C-peptide levels or anti-\nbodies predicts success with insulin pump\ntherapy (163,164). Additionally, the fre-\nquency of follow-up does not in\ufb02uence\noutcomes. Access to insulin pump ther-\napy, including AID systems, should be\nallowed or continued in older adults as\nit is in younger people.\nS118\nDiabetes Technology\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Complications of the pump can be\ncaused by issues with infusion sets (dis-\nlodgement, occlusion), which place indi-\nviduals at risk for ketosis and DKA and\nthus must be recognized and managed\nearly (165). Other pump skin issues\nincluded lipohypertrophy or, less fre-\nquently, lipoatrophy (166,167) and pump\nsite infection (168). Discontinuation of\npump therapy is relatively uncommon\ntoday; the frequency has decreased over\nthe past few decades, and its causes\nhave changed (168,169). Current reasons\nfor attrition are problems with cost or\nwearability, dislike for the pump, sub-\noptimal glycemic outcomes, or mood dis-\norders (e.g., anxiety or depression) (170).\nInsulin Pumps in Youth\nThe safety of insulin pumps in youth\nhas been established for over 15 years\n(171). Studying the effectiveness of in-\nsulin pump therapy in lowering A1C has\nbeen challenging because of the potential\nselection bias of observational studies.\nParticipants on insulin pump therapy\nmay have a higher socioeconomic status\nthat may facilitate better glycemic out-\ncomes (172) versus MDI. In addition, the\nfast pace of development of new insulins\nand technologies quickly renders compar-\nisons obsolete. However, RCTs comparing\ninsulin pumps and MDI with rapid-acting\ninsulin analogs demonstrate a modest im-\nprovement in A1C in participants on insu-\nlin pump therapy (173,174). Observational\nstudies, registry data, and meta-analysis\nhave also suggested an improvement in\nglycemic outcomes in participants on insu-\nlin pump therapy (175\u2013177). Although\nhypoglycemia was a major adverse effect\nof intensi\ufb01ed insulin therapy in the Diabe-\ntes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)\n(178), data suggest that insulin pumps may\nreduce the rates of severe hypoglycemia\ncompared with MDI (177,179\u2013181).\nThere is also evidence that insulin pump\ntherapy may reduce DKA risk (177,182) and\ndiabetes complications, particularly reti-\nnopathy and peripheral neuropathy in\nyouth, compared with MDI (162). In addi-\ntion, treatment satisfaction and quality-\nof-life measures improved on insulin pump\ntherapy compared with MDI (183,184).\nTherefore, insulin pumps can be used\nsafely and effectively in youth with type 1\ndiabetes to assist with achieving targeted\nglycemic outcomes while reducing the risk\nof hypoglycemia and DKA, improving\nquality of life, and preventing long-term\ncomplications. Based on shared decision-\nmaking by people with diabetes and\nhealth care professionals, insulin pumps\nmay be considered in all children and\nadolescents with type 1 diabetes. In partic-\nular, pump therapy may be the preferred\nmode of insulin delivery for children under\n7 years of age (185). Because of a paucity\nof data in adolescents and youth with\ntype 2 diabetes, there is insuf\ufb01cient ev-\nidence to make recommendations.\nCommon barriers to pump therapy\nadoption in children and adolescents are\nconcerns regarding the physical inter-\nference of the device, discomfort with\nthe idea of having a device on the body,\ntherapeutic effectiveness, and \ufb01nancial\nburden (175,186).\nSensor-Augmented Pumps\nSensor-augmented pumps that suspend\ninsulin when glucose is low or are pre-\ndicted to go low within the next 30 min\nhave been approved by the FDA. The\nAutomation to Simulate Pancreatic Insulin\nResponse (ASPIRE) trial of 247 people\nwith type 1 diabetes showed that sensor-\naugmented insulin pump therapy with a\nlow glucose suspend function signi\ufb01-\ncantly reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia\nover 3 months without increasing A1C lev-\nels (55). In a different sensor-augmented\npump, predictive low glucose suspend re-\nduced time spent with glucose <70 mg/dL\nfrom 3.6% at baseline to 2.6% (3.2% with\nsensor-augmented pump therapy without\npredictive low glucose suspend) without\nrebound hyperglycemia during a 6-week\nrandomized crossover trial (187). These\ndevices may offer the opportunity to re-\nduce hypoglycemia for those with a history\nof nocturnal hypoglycemia. Additional\nstudies have been performed in adults\nand children, showing the bene\ufb01ts of\nthis technology (188\u2013190).\nAutomated Insulin Delivery Systems\nAID systems increase and decrease insu-\nlin delivery based on sensor-derived glu-\ncose levels to mimic physiologic insulin\ndelivery. These systems consist of three\ncomponents: an insulin pump, a contin-\nuous glucose monitoring system, and an\nalgorithm that calculates insulin delivery.\nAll AID systems on the market today ad-\njust basal delivery in real time, and some\ndeliver correction doses automatically.\nWhile insulin delivery in closed-loop\nsystems eventually may be truly auto-\nmated, currently used hybrid closed-\nloop systems require the manual entry\nof carbohydrates consumed to calcu-\nlate prandial doses, and adjustments for\nphysical activity must be announced. Mul-\ntiple studies using various systems with\nvarying algorithms, pumps, and sensors\nhave been performed in adults and chil-\ndren (191\u2013200). Evidence suggests AID sys-\ntems may reduce A1C levels and improve\nTIR (201\u2013205). They may also lower the\nrisk of exercise-related hypoglycemia\n(206) and may have psychosocial bene\ufb01ts\n(207\u2013210). The use of AID systems de-\npends on the preference of the person\nwith diabetes and the selection of individ-\nuals (and/or caregivers) who are capa-\nble of safely and effectively using the\ndevices.\nInsulin Pumps in People With Type 2 and\nOther Types of Diabetes\nTraditional insulin pumps can be con-\nsidered for the treatment of people with\ntype 2 diabetes who are on MDI as well\nas those who have other types of dia-\nbetes resulting in insulin de\ufb01ciency, for\ninstance, those who have had a pancre-\natectomy and/or individuals with cystic\n\ufb01brosis (211\u2013215). Similar to data on in-\nsulin pump use in people with type 1 di-\nabetes, reductions in A1C levels are not\nconsistently seen in individuals with type 2\ndiabetes when compared with MDI, al-\nthough this has been seen in some stud-\nies (213,216). Use of insulin pumps in\ninsulin-requiring people with any type\nof diabetes may improve patient satis-\nfaction and simplify therapy (164,211).\nFor people with diabetes judged to be\nclinically insulin de\ufb01cient who are treated\nwith an intensive insulin therapy, the pres-\nence or absence of measurable C-peptide\nlevels does not correlate with response to\ntherapy (164). Alternative pump options in\npeople with type 2 diabetes may include\ndisposable patch-like devices, which pro-\nvide either a continuous subcutaneous\ninfusion of rapid-acting insulin (basal) with\nbolus insulin in 2-unit increments at the\npress of a button or bolus insulin only\ndelivered in 2-unit increments used in\nconjunction with basal insulin injections\n(212,214,217,218). Use of an insulin pump\nas a means of insulin delivery is an individ-\nual choice for people with diabetes and\nshould be considered an option in those\nwho are capable of safely using the device.\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nDiabetes Technology\nS119\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

E\nSome people with type 1 diabetes have\nbeen using \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d (DIY) systems\nthat combine an insulin pump and an\nrtCGM with a controller and an algo-\nrithm designed to automate insulin de-\nlivery (219\u2013223). These systems are not\napproved by the FDA, although efforts\nare underway to obtain regulatory ap-\nproval for some of them. The informa-\ntion on how to set up and manage these\nsystems is freely available on the internet,\nand there are internet groups where peo-\nple inform each other as to how to set up\nand use them. Although health care pro-\nfessionals cannot prescribe these systems,\nit is crucial to keep people with diabetes\nsafe if they are using these methods for\nautomated insulin delivery. Part of this\nentails ensuring people have a backup\nplan in case of pump failure. Addition-\nally, in most DIY systems, insulin doses\nare adjusted based on the pump settings\nfor basal rates, carbohydrate ratios, cor-\nrection doses, and insulin activity. There-\nfore, these settings can be evaluated and\nmodi\ufb01ed based on the individual\u2019s insu-\nlin requirements.\nDigital Health Technology\nRecommendation\n7.29\nSystems that combine technol-\nogy and online coaching can\nbe bene\ufb01cial in treating pre-\ndiabetes and diabetes for some\nindividuals. B\nIncreasingly, people are turning to the\ninternet for advice, coaching, connection,\nand health care. Diabetes, partly because\nit is both common and numeric, lends\nitself to the development of apps and\nonline programs. Recommendations for\ndeveloping and implementing a digital\ndiabetes clinic have been published (224).\nThe FDA approves and monitors clinically\nvalidated, digital, and usually online\nhealth technologies intended to treat a\nmedical or psychological condition; these\nare known as digital therapeutics or\n\u201cdigiceuticals\u201d (fda.gov/medical-devices/\ndigital-health-center-excellence/device-\nsoftware-functions-including-mobile-medical-\napplications) (225). Other applications,\nsuch as those that assist in displaying or\nstoring data, encourage a healthy life-\nstyle or provide limited clinical data sup-\nport. Therefore, it is possible to \ufb01nd\napps that have been fully reviewed and\napproved by the FDA and others de-\nsigned and promoted by people with\nrelatively little skill or knowledge in the\nclinical treatment of diabetes. There is\ninsuf\ufb01cient data to provide recommen-\ndations for speci\ufb01c apps for diabetes\nmanagement, education, and support in\nthe absence of RCTs and validations of\napps unless they are FDA cleared.\nAn area of particular importance is\nthat of online privacy and security. Estab-\nlished cloud-based data aggregator pro-\ngrams, such as Tidepool, Glooko, and\nothers, have been developed with appro-\npriate data security features and are\ncompliant with the U.S. Health Insur-\nance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996. These programs can help moni-\ntor people with diabetes and provide\naccess to their health care team (226).\nConsumers should read the policy re-\ngarding data privacy and sharing before\nentering data into an application and\nlearn how they can control the way\ntheir data will be used (some programs\noffer the ability to share more or less in-\nformation, such as being part of a regis-\ntry or data repository or not).\nMany online programs offer lifestyle\ncounseling to aid with weight loss and\nincrease physical activity (227). Many in-\nclude a health coach and can create\nsmall groups of similar participants on\nsocial networks. Some programs aim to\ntreat prediabetes and prevent progres-\nsion to diabetes, often following the\nmodel of the Diabetes Prevention Program\n(228,229). Others assist in improving dia-\nbetes outcomes by remotely monitoring\nclinical data (for instance, wireless monitor-\ning of glucose levels, weight, or blood\npressure) and providing feedback and\ncoaching (230\u2013235). There are text mes-\nsaging approaches that tie into a variety of\ndifferent types of lifestyle and treatment\nprograms, which vary in terms of their\neffectiveness (236,237). There are lim-\nited RCT data for many of these inter-\nventions, and long-term follow-up is\nlacking. However, for an individual with\ndiabetes, opting into one of these pro-\ngrams can be helpful in providing support\nand, for many, is an attractive option.\nInpatient Care\nRecommendation\n7.30\nPeople with diabetes who are\ncompetent to safely use dia-\nbetes devices such as insulin\npumps and continuous glucose\nmonitoring systems should be\nsupported to continue using\nthem in an inpatient setting\nor during outpatient procedures,\nonce competency is estab-\nlished and proper supervision\nis available. E\nIndividuals who are comfortable using\ntheir diabetes devices, such as insulin\npumps and CGM, should be allowed to\nuse them in an inpatient setting if they\nare well enough to take care of the de-\nvices and have brought the necessary\nsupplies (238\u2013242). People with diabe-\ntes who are familiar with treating their\nown glucose levels can often adjust in-\nsulin doses more knowledgeably than\ninpatient staff who do not personally\nknow the individual or their manage-\nment style. However, this should occur\nbased on the hospital\u2019s policies for dia-\nbetes management and use of diabetes\ntechnology, and there should be super-\nvision to ensure that the individual is\nachieving and maintaining glycemic tar-\ngets during acute illness in a hospitalized\nsetting where factors such as infection,\ncertain medications, immobility, changes\nin nutrition, and other factors can im-\npact insulin sensitivity and the insulin\nresponse.\nWith the advent of the coronavirus\ndisease 2019 pandemic, the FDA exer-\ncised enforcement discretion by allow-\ning CGM device use temporarily in the\nhospital for patient monitoring (243).\nThis approach has been used to reduce\nthe use of personal protective equip-\nment and more closely monitor patients\nso that health care personnel do not\nhave to go into a patient room solely to\nmeasure a glucose level (244\u2013246).

    "text": "are underway to assess the effectiveness\nof this approach, which may ultimately\nlead to the approved use of CGM for\nmonitoring hospitalized individuals (247\u2013\n253).\nWhen used in the setting of a clinical\ntrial or when clinical circumstances (such\nas during a shortage of personal protec-\ntive equipment) require it, CGM can be\nused to manage hospitalized individuals\nin conjunction with BGM. Point-of-care\nBGM remains the approved method for\nglucose monitoring in hospitals, espe-\ncially for dosing insulin and treating\nhypoglycemia. For more information,\nsee Section 16, \u201cDiabetes Care in the\nHospital.\u201d\nThe Future\nThe pace of development in diabetes\ntechnology is extremely rapid. New ap-\nproaches and tools are available each\nyear. It is hard for research to keep up\nwith these advances because newer ver-\nsions of the devices and digital solutions\nare already on the market when a study\nis completed. The most important com-\nponent in all of these systems is the per-\nson with diabetes. Technology selection\nmust be appropriate for the individual.\nSimply having a device or application does\nnot change outcomes unless the human\nbeing engages with it to create positive\nhealth bene\ufb01ts. This underscores the\nneed for the health care team to assist\npeople with diabetes in device and pro-\ngram selection and to support its use\nthrough ongoing education and train-\ning. Expectations must be tempered by\nreality\u2014we do not yet have technology\nthat completely eliminates the self-care\ntasks necessary for managing diabetes,\nbut the tools described in this section\ncan make it easier to manage.\nReferences\n1.

Obesity and Weight\nManagement for the Prevention\nand Treatment of Type 2\nDiabetes: Standards of Care in\nDiabetes\u20142023\nDiabetes Care 2023;46(Suppl. 1):S128\u2013S139 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-S008\nNuha A.

Gabbay,\non behalf of the American Diabetes\nAssociation\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) \u201cStandards of Care in Diabetes\u201d in-\ncludes the ADA\u2019s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to\nprovide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guide-\nlines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional\nPractice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for up-\ndating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a de-\ntailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the\nevidence-grading system for ADA\u2019s clinical practice recommendations and a full\nlist of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction\nand Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are\ninvited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.\nObesity is a chronic and often progressive disease with numerous medical, physical,\nand psychosocial complications, including a substantially increased risk for type 2\ndiabetes (1). There is strong and consistent evidence that obesity management can\ndelay the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (2\u20136) and is highly bene-\n\ufb01cial in treating type 2 diabetes (7\u201318). In people with type 2 diabetes and over-\nweight or obesity, modest weight loss improves glycemia and reduces the need for\nglucose-lowering medications (7\u20139), and larger weight loss substantially reduces A1C\nand fasting glucose and has been shown to promote sustained diabetes remission\nthrough at least 2 years (11,19\u201323). Several modalities, including intensive behavioral\ncounseling, obesity pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, may aid in achieving and\nmaintaining meaningful weight loss and reducing obesity-associated health risks.\nMetabolic surgery strongly improves glycemia and often leads to remission of diabe-\ntes, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced mortal-\nity. The importance of addressing obesity is further heightened by numerous studies\nshowing that both obesity and diabetes increase the risk for more severe coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) infections (24\u201327). This section aims to provide evidence-\nbased recommendations for obesity management, including behavioral, pharmaco-\nlogic, and surgical interventions, in people with type 2 diabetes and in those at risk.\nThis section focuses on obesity management in adults; further discussion on obesity\nin older individuals and children can be found in Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d and Sec-\ntion 14, \u201cChildren and Adolescents,\u201d respectively.\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G, Aroda\nVR, et al., American Diabetes Association. 8.\nObesity and weight management for the pre-\nvention and treatment of type 2 diabetes:\nStandards of Care in Diabetes\u20142023.

E\n8.2\nMeasure height and weight\nand calculate BMI at annual\nvisits or more frequently. As-\nsess weight trajectory to inform\ntreatment considerations. E\n8.3\nBased on clinical considera-\ntions, such as the presence of\ncomorbid heart failure or signif-\nicant unexplained weight gain\nor loss, weight may need to be\nmonitored and evaluated more\nfrequently. B If deterioration of\nmedical status is associated with\nsigni\ufb01cant weight gain or loss,\ninpatient evaluation should be\nconsidered, especially focused\non associations between medi-\ncation use, food intake, and gly-\ncemic status. E\n8.4\nAccommodations should be\nmade to provide privacy dur-\ning weighing. E\n8.5\nIndividuals with diabetes and\noverweight or obesity may\nbene\ufb01t from modest or larger\nmagnitudes of weight loss.\nRelatively small weight loss\n(approximately 3\u20137% of base-\nline weight) improves glycemia\nand other intermediate cardio-\nvascular risk factors. A Larger,\nsustained weight losses (>10%)\nusually confer greater bene\ufb01ts,\nincluding disease-modifying ef-\nfects and possible remission of\ntype 2 diabetes, and may im-\nprove long-term cardiovascular\noutcomes and mortality. B\nA person-centered communication style\nthat uses inclusive and nonjudgmental lan-\nguage and active listening to elicit individ-\nual preferences and beliefs and assesses\npotential barriers to care should be used\nto optimize health outcomes and health-\nrelated quality of life. Use person-\ufb01rst lan-\nguage (e.g., \u201cperson with obesity\u201d rather\nthan \u201cobese person\u201d) to avoid de\ufb01ning\npeople by their condition (28\u201330).\nHeight and weight should be measured\nto calculate BMI annually or more fre-\nquently when appropriate (20). BMI, calcu-\nlated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters (kg/m2), is calcu-\nlated automatically by most electronic med-\nical records. Use BMI to document weight\nstatus (overweight: BMI 25\u201329.9 kg/m2;\nobesity class I: BMI 30\u201334.9 kg/m2; obesity\nclass II: BMI 35\u201339.9 kg/m2; obesity class\nIII: BMI $40 kg/m2) but note that misclassi-\n\ufb01cation can occur, particularly in very mus-\ncular or frail individuals. In some groups,\nnotably Asian and Asian American popu-\nlations, the BMI cut points to de\ufb01ne over-\nweight and obesity are lower than those\nin other populations due to differences in\nbody composition and cardiometabolic\nrisk (Table 8.1) (30,31). Clinical considera-\ntions, such as the presence of comorbid\nheart failure or unexplained weight change,\nmay warrant more frequent weight mea-\nsurement and evaluation (32,33). If weigh-\ning is questioned or refused, the practitioner\nshould be mindful of possible prior stigma-\ntizing experiences and query for concerns,\nand the value of weight monitoring should\nbe explained as a part of the medical eval-\nuation process that helps to inform treat-\nment decisions (34,35). Accommodations\nshould be made to ensure privacy during\nweighing, particularly for those individuals\nwho report or exhibit a high level of\nweight-related distress or dissatisfaction.\nScales should be situated in a private area\nor room. Weight should be measured and\nreported nonjudgmentally. Care should be\ntaken to regard a person\u2019s weight (and\nweight changes) and BMI as sensitive\nhealth information. In addition to weight\nand BMI, assessment of weight distribu-\ntion (including propensity for central/\nvisceral adipose deposition) and weight\ngain pattern and trajectory can further\ninform risk strati\ufb01cation and treatment\noptions (36).\nHealth care professionals should ad-\nvise individuals with overweight or obe-\nsity and those with increasing weight\ntrajectories that, in general, higher BMIs\nincrease the risk of diabetes, cardiovas-\ncular disease, and all-cause mortality, as\nwell as other adverse health and quality\nof life outcomes. Health care professio-\nnals should assess readiness to engage\nin behavioral changes for weight loss and\njointly determine behavioral and weight\nloss goals and individualized intervention\nstrategies (37). Strategies may include nutri-\ntion changes, physical activity, behavioral\ncounseling, pharmacologic therapy, medical\ndevices, and metabolic surgery (Table 8.1).\nThe latter three strategies may be consid-\nered for carefully selected individuals as\nadjuncts to nutrition changes, physical ac-\ntivity, and behavioral counseling.\nAmong people with type 2 diabetes\nand overweight or obesity who have in-\nadequate glycemic, blood pressure, and\nlipid control and/or other obesity-related\nmedical conditions, modest and sustained\nweight loss improves glycemia, blood\npressure, and lipids and may reduce the\nneed for medications (7\u20139,38). Greater\nweight loss may produce even greater\nbene\ufb01ts (21,22).\nAs little as 3\u20137% weight loss reduces\nthe risk for diabetes in people at risk and\nimproves glycemia in those with diabetes\n(2,7,8,39,40). Given the challenge of losing\nweight and maintaining weight loss, aim-\ning for relatively small and attainable\nweight loss is often an effective clinical\nstrategy, particularly for individuals who\nfeel overwhelmed by larger weight loss\ntargets. Nevertheless, mounting data from\nintensive nutrition and behavioral change\ninterventions, pharmacotherapy, and bar-\niatric surgery have shown that more sub-\nstantial weight loss usually confers still\ngreater bene\ufb01ts on glycemia and possi-\nbly disease remission as well as other\ncardiometabolic and quality-of-life out-\ncomes (6,21\u201323,41\u201350).\nWith the increasing availability of more\neffective obesity treatments, individuals\nwith diabetes and overweight or obesity\nshould be informed of the potential bene-\n\ufb01ts of both modest and more substantial\nweight loss and guided in the range of\navailable treatment options, as discussed\nin the sections below. Shared decision-\nmaking should be used when counseling\non behavioral changes, intervention choices,\nand weight management goals.\nNUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,\nAND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY\nRecommendations\n8.6\nNutrition, physical activity, and\nbehavioral therapy to achieve\nand maintain $5% weight loss\nare recommended for most\npeople with type 2 diabetes\nand overweight or obesity.\nAdditional weight loss usually\nresults in further improve-\nments in the management of di-\nabetes and cardiovascular risk.

In the intensive lifestyle inter-\nvention group, mean weight loss was\n4.7% at 8 years (40). Approximately 50%\nof intensive lifestyle intervention partici-\npants lost and maintained $5% of their\ninitial body weight, and 27% lost and\nmaintained $10% of their initial body\nweight at 8 years (40). Participants as-\nsigned to the intensive lifestyle group\nrequired fewer glucose-, blood pressure\u2013,\nand lipid-lowering medications than those\nrandomly assigned to standard care. Sec-\nondary analyses of the Look AHEAD trial\nand other large cardiovascular outcome\nstudies document additional weight loss\nbene\ufb01ts in people with type 2 diabetes,\nincluding improved mobility, physical and\nsexual function, and health-related quality\nof life (32). Moreover, several subgroups\nhad improved cardiovascular outcomes,\nincluding those who achieved >10%\nweight loss (41) and those with moder-\nately or poorly managed diabetes (A1C\n>6.8%) at baseline (42).\nBehavioral Interventions\nSigni\ufb01cant weight loss can be attained\nwith lifestyle programs that achieve\na 500\u2013750 kcal/day energy de\ufb01cit,\nwhich in most cases is approximately\n1,200\u20131,500 kcal/day for women and\n1,500\u20131,800 kcal/day for men, ad-\njusted for the individual\u2019s baseline\nbody weight. Clinical bene\ufb01ts typically be-\ngin upon achieving 3\u20135% weight loss\n(20,51), and the bene\ufb01ts of weight loss\nare progressive; more intensive weight\nloss goals (>5%, >7%, >15%, etc.) may\nbe pursued if needed to achieve further\nhealth improvements and/or if the individ-\nual is more motivated and more intensive\ngoals can be feasibly and safely attained.\nNutrition interventions may differ\nby macronutrient goals and food choices\nas long as they create the necessary en-\nergy de\ufb01cit to promote weight loss\n(20,52\u201354).

Assessing\nan individual\u2019s motivation level, life cir-\ncumstances, and willingness to implement\nbehavioral changes to achieve weight loss\nshould be considered along with medical\nstatus when weight loss interventions are\nrecommended and initiated (37,56).\nPeople with type 2 diabetes and over-\nweight or obesity who have lost weight\nshould be offered long-term ($1 year)\ncomprehensive weight loss maintenance\nprograms that provide at least monthly\ncontact with trained interventionists and\nfocus on ongoing monitoring of body\nweight (weekly or more frequently) and/\nor other self-monitoring strategies such\nas tracking intake, steps, etc.; continued\nfocus on nutrition and behavioral changes;\nand participation in high levels of physical\nactivity (200\u2013300 min/week) (57). Some\ncommercial and proprietary weight loss\nprograms have shown promising weight\nloss results. However, most lack evi-\ndence of effectiveness, many do not\nsatisfy guideline recommendations, and\nsome promote unscienti\ufb01c and possibly\ndangerous practices (58,59).\nWhen provided by trained practitioners\nin medical settings with ongoing monitor-\ning, short-term (generally up to 3 months)\nintensive nutrition intervention may be\nprescribed for carefully selected individu-\nals, such as those requiring weight loss be-\nfore surgery and those needing greater\nweight loss and glycemic improvements.\nWhen integrated with behavioral support\nand counseling, structured very-low-calo-\nrie meals, typically 800\u20131,000 kcal/day,\nutilizing high-protein foods and meal re-\nplacement products, may increase the\npace and/or magnitude of initial weight\nloss and glycemic improvements compared\nwith standard behavioral interventions\n(21,22). As weight regain is common, such\ninterventions should include long-term,\ncomprehensive weight maintenance strate-\ngies and counseling to maintain weight loss\nand behavioral changes (60,61).\nDespite widespread marketing and ex-\norbitant claims, there is no clear evidence\nthat nutrition supplements (such as herbs\nand botanicals, high-dose vitamins and\nminerals, amino acids, enzymes, antioxidants,\netc.) are effective for obesity manage-\nment or weight loss (62\u201364). Several large\nsystematic reviews show that most trials\nevaluating nutrition supplements for weight\nloss are of low quality and at high risk for\nbias. High-quality published studies show\nlittle or no weight loss bene\ufb01ts. In contrast,\nvitamin/mineral (e.g., iron, vitamin B12, vi-\ntamin D) supplementation may be indicated\nin cases of documented de\ufb01ciency, and pro-\ntein supplements may be indicated as ad-\njuncts to medically supervised weight loss\ntherapies.\nHealth disparities adversely affect peo-\nple who have systematically experienced\ngreater obstacles to health based on their\nrace or ethnicity, socioeconomic status,\ngender, disability, or other factors. Over-\nwhelming research shows that these dis-\nparities may signi\ufb01cantly affect health\noutcomes, including increasing the risk for\nobesity, diabetes, and diabetes-related\ncomplications. Health care professionals\nshould evaluate systemic, structural, and\nsocioeconomic factors that may impact\nfood choices, access to healthful foods,\nand nutrition patterns; behavioral pat-\nterns, such as neighborhood safety and\navailability of safe outdoor spaces for phys-\nical activity; environmental exposures; ac-\ncess to health care; social contexts; and,\nultimately, diabetes risk and outcomes. For\na detailed discussion of social determi-\nnants of health, refer to \u201cSocial Determi-\nnants of Health: A Scienti\ufb01c Review\u201d (65).\nPHARMACOTHERAPY\nRecommendations\n8.14\nWhen choosing glucose-lowering\nmedications for people with\ntype 2 diabetes and overweight\nor obesity, consider the medica-\ntion\u2019s effect on weight. B\n8.15\nWhenever possible, minimize\nmedications for comorbid con-\nditions that are associated with\nweight gain. E\n8.16\nObesity pharmacotherapy is\neffective as an adjunct to nu-\ntrition, physical activity, and be-\nhavioral counseling for selected\npeople with type 2 diabetes\nand BMI $27 kg/m2. Potential\nbene\ufb01ts and risks must be con-\nsidered. A\n8.17\nIf obesity pharmacotherapy\nis effective (typically de\ufb01ned\nas $5% weight loss after\n3 months\u2019 use), further weight\nloss is likely with continued\nuse. When early response is in-\nsuf\ufb01cient (typically <5% weight\nloss after 3 months\u2019 use) or\nif there are signi\ufb01cant safety\nor tolerability issues, consider\ndiscontinuation of the medi-\ncation and evaluate alterna-\ntive medications or treatment\napproaches. A\nGlucose-Lowering Therapy\nA meta-analysis of 227 randomized con-\ntrolled trials of glucose-lowering treat-\nments in type 2 diabetes found that A1C\nchanges were not associated with base-\nline BMI, indicating that people with obe-\nsity can bene\ufb01t from the same types of\ntreatments for diabetes as normal-weight\nindividuals (66). As numerous effective\nmedications are available when consider-\ning medication plans, health care profes-\nsionals should consider each medication\u2019s\neffect on weight. Agents associated\nwith varying degrees of weight loss in-\nclude metformin, a-glucosidase inhibi-\ntors, sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2\ninhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 re-\nceptor agonists, dual glucagon-like pep-\ntide 1/glucose\u2013dependent insulinotropic\npolypeptide receptor agonist (tirzepa-\ntide), and amylin mimetics. Dipeptidyl\npeptidase 4 inhibitors are weight neu-\ntral. In contrast, insulin secretagogues,\nthiazolidinediones, and insulin are often as-\nsociated with weight gain (see Section 9,\n\u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic\nTreatment\u201d).\nConcomitant Medications\nHealth care professionals should carefully\nreview the patient\u2019s concomitant medica-\ntions and, whenever possible, minimize or\nprovide alternatives for medications that\npromote weight gain. Examples of medica-\ntions associated with weight gain include\nantipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine,\nrisperidone), some antidepressants (e.g.,\ntricyclic antidepressants, some selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors, and mono-\namine oxidase inhibitors), glucocorticoids,\ninjectable progestins, some anticonvul-\nsants (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), and\npossibly sedating antihistamines and anti-\ncholinergics (67).\nApproved Obesity Pharmacotherapy\nOptions\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) has approved medications for both\nshort-term and long-term weight manage-\nment as adjuncts to nutrition, physical ac-\ntivity and behavioral therapy.

    "text": "FDA-approved obesity medications have\nbeen shown to improve glycemia in peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes and delay pro-\ngression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk\nindividuals (23). Phentermine and other\nolder adrenergic agents are indicated for\nshort-term (#12 weeks) treatment (68).\nFive medications are FDA approved for\nlong-term use (>12 weeks) in adults with\nBMI $27 kg/m2 with one or more obe-\nsity-associated comorbid conditions (e.g.,\ntype 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or\ndyslipidemia) who are motivated to lose\nweight (23). (Refer to Section 14, \u201cChildren\nand Adolescents,\u201d for medications ap-\nproved for adolescents with obesity.) Med-\nications approved by the FDA for the\ntreatment of obesity, summarized in Table\n8.2, include orlistat, phentermine/topira-\nmate ER, naltrexone/bupropion ER, liraglu-\ntide 3 mg, and semaglutide 2.4 mg. (In\naddition, setmelanotide, a melanocortin 4\nreceptor agonist, is approved for use in\ncases of rare genetic mutations resulting in\nsevere hyperphagia and extreme obesity,\nsuch as leptin receptor de\ufb01ciency and\nproopiomelanocortin de\ufb01ciency.) In princi-\nple, medications help improve adherence\nto nutrition recommendations, in most\ncases by modulating appetite or satiety.\nHealth care professionals should be knowl-\nedgeable about the product label and bal-\nance the potential bene\ufb01ts of successful\nweight loss against the potential risks of\nthe medication for each individual. These\nmedications are contraindicated in individ-\nuals who are pregnant or actively trying to\nconceive and not recommended for use\nin women who are nursing. Individuals of\nreproductive potential should receive\ncounseling regarding the use of reliable\nmethods of contraception. Of note, while\nweight loss medications are often used in\npeople with type 1 diabetes, clinical trial\ndata in this population are limited.\nAssessing Efficacy and Safety\nUpon initiating weight loss medication, as-\nsess ef\ufb01cacy and safety at least monthly\nfor the \ufb01rst 3 months and at least quar-\nterly thereafter. Modeling from published\nclinical trials consistently shows that early\nresponders have improved long-term out-\ncomes (69\u201371). Unless clinical circumstan-\nces (such as poor tolerability) or other\nconsiderations (such as \ufb01nancial expense\nor individual preference) suggest other-\nwise, those who achieve suf\ufb01cient early\nweight loss upon starting a chronic weight\nloss medication (typically de\ufb01ned as >5%\nweight loss after 3 months\u2019 use) should\ncontinue the medication. When early use\nappears ineffective (typically <5% weight\nloss after 3 months\u2019 use), it is unlikely that\ncontinued use will improve weight out-\ncomes; as such, it should be recom-\nmended to discontinue the medication\nand consider other treatment options.\nMEDICAL DEVICES FOR WEIGHT LOSS\nWhile gastric banding devices have fallen\nout of favor in recent years, since 2015,\nseveral minimally invasive medical devices\nhave been approved by the FDA for short-\nterm weight loss, including implanted gas-\ntric balloons, a vagus nerve stimulator, and\ngastric aspiration therapy (72). Given the\ncurrent high cost, limited insurance cover-\nage, and paucity of data in people with\ndiabetes, medical devices for weight loss\nare rarely utilized at this time, and it re-\nmains to be seen how they may be used\nin the future (73).\nAn oral hydrogel (Plenity) has re-\ncently been approved for long-term use\nin those with BMI >25 kg/m2 to simu-\nlate the space-occupying effect of im-\nplantable gastric balloons. Taken with\nwater 30 min before meals, the hydro-\ngel expands to \ufb01ll a portion of the stom-\nach volume to help decrease food intake\nduring meals. Though average weight loss\nis relatively small (2\u20133% greater than pla-\ncebo), the subgroup of participants with\nprediabetes or diabetes at baseline had\nimproved weight loss outcomes (8.1%\nweight loss) compared with the overall\ntreatment (6.4% weight loss) and placebo\n(4.4% weight loss) groups (74).\nMETABOLIC SURGERY\nRecommendations\n8.18\nMetabolic surgery should be a\nrecommended option to treat\ntype 2 diabetes in screened\nsurgical candidates with BMI\n$40 kg/m2 (BMI $37.5 kg/m2\nin Asian American individuals)\nand in adults with BMI 35.0\u2013\n39.9 kg/m2 (32.5\u201337.4 kg/m2 in\nAsian American individuals) who\ndo not achieve durable weight\nloss and improvement in co-\nmorbidities (including hyper-\nglycemia) with\nnonsurgical\nmethods. A\n8.19\nMetabolic surgery may be\nconsidered as an option to\ntreat type 2 diabetes in adults\nwith\nBMI\n30.0\u201334.9\nkg/m2\n(27.5\u201332.4 kg/m2 in Asian\nAmerican individuals) who do\nnot achieve durable weight loss\nand improvement in comorbid-\nities (including hyperglycemia)\nwith nonsurgical methods. A\n8.20\nMetabolic\nsurgery\nshould\nbe performed in high-volume\ncenters with multidisciplinary\nteams knowledgeable about\nand experienced in managing\nobesity, diabetes, and gastro-\nintestinal surgery. E\n8.21\nPeople being considered for\nmetabolic surgery should be\nevaluated for comorbid psycho-\nlogical conditions and social\nand situational circumstances\nthat have the potential to inter-\nfere with surgery outcomes.

    "text": "diabetes. Given the magnitude and rapid-\nity of improvement of hyperglycemia and\nglucose homeostasis, these procedures\nhave been suggested as treatments for\ntype 2 diabetes even in the absence of\nsevere obesity and will be referred to\nhere as \u201cmetabolic surgery.\u201d\nA substantial body of evidence, includ-\ning data from numerous large cohort\nstudies and randomized controlled (non-\nblinded) clinical trials, demonstrates that\nmetabolic surgery achieves superior gly-\ncemic control and reduction of cardio-\nvascular risk in people with type 2\ndiabetes and obesity compared with\nnonsurgical intervention (18). In addition\nto improving glycemia, metabolic surgery\nreduces the incidence of microvascular\ndisease (75), improves quality of life\n(43,76,77), decreases cancer risk, and\nimproves cardiovascular disease risk fac-\ntors and long-term cardiovascular events\n(78\u201389). Cohort studies that match surgi-\ncal and nonsurgical subjects strongly sug-\ngest that metabolic surgery reduces\nall-cause mortality (90,91).\nThe overwhelming majority of proce-\ndures in the U.S. are vertical sleeve gas-\ntrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric\nbypass (RYGB). Both procedures result in\nan anatomically smaller stomach pouch\nand often robust changes in enteroendo-\ncrine hormones. In VSG, \u000180% of the\nstomach is removed, leaving behind a\nlong, thin sleeve-shaped pouch. RYGB\ncreates a much smaller stomach pouch\n(roughly the size of a walnut), which is\nthen attached to the distal small intes-\ntine, thereby bypassing the duodenum\nand jejunum (Fig. 8.1).\nSeveral organizations recommend low-\nering the BMI criteria for metabolic surgery\nto 30 kg/m2 (27.5 kg/m2 for Asian Ameri-\ncan individuals) for people with type 2 dia-\nbetes who have not achieved suf\ufb01cient\nweight loss and improved comorbidities\n(including hyperglycemia) with reasonable\nnonsurgical treatments. Studies have docu-\nmented diabetes remission after 1\u20135 years\nin 30\u201363% of patients with RYGB (18,93).\nMost notably, the Surgical Treatment\nand Medications Potentially Eradicate\nDiabetes Ef\ufb01ciently (STAMPEDE) trial,\nwhich randomized 150 participants with\nunmanaged diabetes to receive either\nmetabolic surgery or medical treatment,\nfound that 29% of those treated with\nRYGB and 23% treated with VSG achieved\nA1C of 6.0% or lower after 5 years (43).\nAvailable data suggest an erosion of\ndiabetes remission over time (44); at\nleast 35\u201350% of patients who initially\nachieve remission of diabetes eventually\nexperience recurrence. Still, the median\ndisease-free period among such individ-\nuals following RYGB is 8.3 years (94,95),\nand the majority of those who undergo\nsurgery maintain substantial improve-\nment of glycemia from baseline for at\nleast 5\u201315 years (43,76,79,80,95\u201398).\nExceedingly few presurgical predictors\nof success have been identi\ufb01ed, but\nyounger age, shorter duration of diabetes\n(e.g., <8 years) (70), and lesser severity\nof diabetes (better glycemic control, non-\nuse of insulin) are associated with higher\nrates of diabetes remission (43,79,97,99).\nGreater baseline visceral fat area may\nalso predict improved postoperative out-\ncomes, especially among Asian American\npeople with type 2 diabetes (100).\nAlthough surgery has been shown to\nimprove the metabolic pro\ufb01les of people\nwith type 1 diabetes, larger and longer-\nterm studies are needed to determine\nthe role of metabolic surgery in such in-\ndividuals (101).\nWhereas metabolic surgery has greater\ninitial costs than nonsurgical obesity\ntreatments, retrospective analyses and\nmodeling studies suggest that surgery\nmay be cost-effective or even cost-\nsaving for individuals with type 2 diabe-\ntes. However, these results largely depend\non assumptions about the long-term ef-\nfectiveness and safety of the procedures\n(102,103).\nPotential Risks and Complications\nThe safety of metabolic surgery has im-\nproved signi\ufb01cantly with continued re\ufb01ne-\nment of minimally invasive (laparoscopic)\napproaches, enhanced training and\ncredentialing, and involvement of multi-\ndisciplinary teams. Perioperative mortal-\nity rates are typically 0.1\u20130.5%, similar to\nthose of common abdominal procedures\nsuch as cholecystectomy or hysterec-\ntomy (104\u2013108). Major complications\noccur in 2\u20136% of those undergoing met-\nabolic surgery, which compares favor-\nably with the rates for other commonly\nperformed elective operations (108).\nPostsurgical recovery times and morbid-\nity have also dramatically declined. Minor\ncomplications and need for operative rein-\ntervention occur in up to 15% (104\u2013113).\nEmpirical data suggest that the pro\ufb01ciency\nof the operating surgeon and surgical\nteam is an important factor in determin-\ning mortality, complications, reoperations,\nand readmissions (114). Accordingly, met-\nabolic surgery should be performed in\nhigh-volume centers with multidisciplinary\nteams experienced in managing diabetes,\nobesity, and gastrointestinal surgery.\nBeyond the perioperative period,\nlonger-term risks include vitamin and\nmineral de\ufb01ciencies, anemia, osteopo-\nrosis, dumping syndrome, and severe\nhypoglycemia (115). Nutritional and\nmicronutrient de\ufb01ciencies and related\ncomplications occur with a variable fre-\nquency depending on the type of proce-\ndure and require routine monitoring of\nmicronutrient and nutritional status and\nlifelong vitamin/nutritional supplemen-\ntation (115). Dumping syndrome usually\noccurs shortly (10\u201330 min) after a meal\nand may present with diarrhea, nausea,\nvomiting, palpitations, and fatigue; hy-\npoglycemia is usually not present at the\ntime of symptoms but, in some cases,\nmay develop several hours later.\nFigure 8.1\u2014A: Vertical sleeve gastrectomy.

    "text": "Postbariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) can\noccur with RYGB, VSG, and other gastro-\nintestinal procedures and may severely\nimpact quality of life (116\u2013118). PBH is\ndriven in part by altered gastric empty-\ning of ingested nutrients, leading to rapid\nintestinal glucose absorption and exces-\nsive postprandial secretion of glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 and other gastrointestinal\npeptides. As a result, overstimulation of in-\nsulin release and a sharp drop in plasma\nglucose occur, most commonly 1\u20133 h after\na high-carbohydrate meal. Symptoms range\nfrom sweating, tremor, tachycardia, and in-\ncreased hunger to impaired cognition, loss\nof consciousness, and seizures. In contrast\nto dumping syndrome, which often occurs\nsoon after surgery and improves over\ntime, PBH typically presents >1 year\npost-surgery. Diagnosis is primarily made\nby a thorough history, detailed records of\nfood intake, physical activity, and symp-\ntom patterns, and exclusion of other\npotential causes (e.g., malnutrition, side\neffects of medications or supplements,\ndumping syndrome, and insulinoma). Ini-\ntial management includes education to\nfacilitate reduced intake of rapidly di-\ngested carbohydrates while ensuring ade-\nquate intake of protein and healthy fats,\nand vitamin/nutrient supplements. When\navailable, patients should be offered medi-\ncal nutrition therapy with a dietitian expe-\nrienced in PBH and the use of continuous\nglucose monitoring (ideally real-time con-\ntinuous glucose monitoring, which can\ndetect dropping glucose levels before se-\nvere hypoglycemia occurs), especially for\nthose with hypoglycemia unawareness.\nMedication treatment, if needed, is pri-\nmarily aimed at slowing carbohydrate\nabsorption (e.g., acarbose) or reducing\nglucagon-like peptide 1 and insulin secre-\ntion (e.g., diazoxide, octreotide) (119).\nPeople who undergo metabolic surgery\nmay also be at increased risk for substance\nabuse, worsening or new-onset depression\nand/or anxiety disorders, and suicidal idea-\ntion (115,120\u2013125). Candidates for meta-\nbolic surgery should be assessed by a\nmental health professional with expertise\nin obesity management prior to consider-\nation for surgery (126). Surgery should be\npostponed in individuals with alcohol or\nsubstance use disorders, severe depres-\nsion, suicidal ideation, or other signi\ufb01cant\nmental health conditions until these condi-\ntions have been suf\ufb01ciently addressed. In-\ndividuals with preoperative or new-onset\npsychopathology should be assessed regu-\nlarly following surgery to optimize mental\nhealth and postsurgical outcomes.\nReferences\n1.

Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are\ninvited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.\nPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES\nRecommendations\n9.1 Most individuals with type 1 diabetes should be treated with multiple daily\ninjections of prandial and basal insulin, or continuous subcutaneous insulin\ninfusion. A\n9.2 Most individuals with type 1 diabetes should use rapid-acting insulin analogs\nto reduce hypoglycemia risk. A\n9.3 Individuals with type 1 diabetes should receive education on how to match\nmealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate intake, fat and protein content, and\nanticipated physical activity. B\nInsulin Therapy\nBecause the hallmark of type 1 diabetes is absent or near-absent b-cell function,\ninsulin treatment is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes. In addition to hy-\nperglycemia, insulinopenia can contribute to other metabolic disturbances like hy-\npertriglyceridemia and ketoacidosis as well as tissue catabolism that can be life\nthreatening. Severe metabolic decompensation can be, and was, mostly prevented\nwith once- or twice-daily injections for the six or seven decades after the discovery\nof insulin. However, over the past three decades, evidence has accumulated sup-\nporting more intensive insulin replacement, using multiple daily injections of insulin\nor continuous subcutaneous administration through an insulin pump, as providing\nthe best combination of effectiveness and safety for people with type 1 diabetes.\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive\ntherapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion\n(CSII) reduced A1C and was associated with improved long-term outcomes (1\u20133).\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G,\nAroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.\n9.

    "text": "The study was carried out with short-\nacting (regular) and intermediate-acting\n(NPH) human insulins. In this landmark\ntrial, lower A1C with intensive control\n(7%) led to \u000150% reductions in micro-\nvascular complications over 6 years of\ntreatment. However, intensive therapy\nwas associated with a higher rate of se-\nvere hypoglycemia than conventional\ntreatment (62 compared with 19 epi-\nsodes per 100 patient-years of therapy).\nFollow-up of subjects from the DCCT\nmore than 10 years after the active treat-\nment component of the study demon-\nstrated fewer macrovascular as well as\nfewer microvascular complications in the\ngroup that received intensive treatment\n(2,4).\nInsulin replacement regimens typically\nconsist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin,\nand correction insulin (5). Basal insulin\nincludes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin\nanalogs, and continuous delivery of rapid-\nacting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal\ninsulin analogs have longer duration of\naction with \ufb02atter, more constant plasma\nconcentrations and activity pro\ufb01les than\nNPH insulin; rapid-acting analogs (RAA)\nhave a quicker onset and peak and shorter\nduration of action than regular human in-\nsulin. In people with type 1 diabetes, treat-\nment with analog insulins is associated\nwith less hypoglycemia and weight gain as\nwell as lower A1C compared with human\ninsulins (6\u20138). More recently, two inject-\nable insulin formulations with enhanced\nrapid-action pro\ufb01les have been introduced.\nInhaled human insulin has a rapid peak\nand shortened duration of action com-\npared with RAA and may cause less hypo-\nglycemia and weight gain (9) (see also\nsubsection ALTERNATIVE INSULIN ROUTES in\nPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2\nDIABETES), and faster-acting insulin aspart\nand insulin lispro-aabc may reduce pran-\ndial excursions better than RAA (10\u201312).\nIn addition, longer-acting basal analogs\n(U-300 glargine or degludec) may confer\na lower hypoglycemia risk compared with\nU-100 glargine in individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (13,14). Despite the advantages\nof insulin analogs in individuals with type 1\ndiabetes, for some individuals the expense\nand/or intensity of treatment required for\ntheir use is prohibitive. There are multiple\napproaches to insulin treatment, and the\ncentral precept in the management of\ntype 1 diabetes is that some form of insu-\nlin be given in a planned regimen tailored\nto the individual to keep them safe and\nout of diabetic ketoacidosis and to avoid\nsigni\ufb01cant hypoglycemia, with every ef-\nfort made to reach the individual\u2019s gly-\ncemic targets.\nMost studies comparing multiple daily\ninjections with CSII have been relatively\nsmall and of short duration. However, a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis con-\ncluded that CSII via pump therapy has\nmodest advantages for lowering A1C\n(\u00030.30% [95% CI \u00030.58 to \u00030.02]) and\nfor reducing severe hypoglycemia rates\nin children and adults (15). However,\nthere is no consensus to guide the choice\nof injection or pump therapy in a given\nindividual, and research to guide this deci-\nsion-making is needed (16). The arrival of\ncontinuous glucose monitors (CGM) to\nclinical practice has proven bene\ufb01cial in\npeople using insulin therapy. Its use is\nnow considered standard of care for most\npeople with type 1 diabetes (5) (see Sec-\ntion 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d). Reduction\nof nocturnal hypoglycemia in individuals\nwith type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps\nwith CGM is improved by automatic sus-\npension of insulin delivery at a preset glu-\ncose level (16\u201318). When choosing among\ninsulin delivery systems, individual pref-\nerences, cost, insulin type and dosing\nregimen, and self-management capabili-\nties should be considered (see Section 7,\n\u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d).\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) has now approved multiple\nhybrid closed-loop pump systems (also\ncalled automated insulin delivery [AID]\nsystems). The safety and ef\ufb01cacy of hybrid\nclosed-loop systems has been supported\nin the literature in adolescents and adults\nwith type 1 diabetes (19,20), and evi-\ndence suggests that a closed-loop system\nis superior to sensor-augmented pump\ntherapy for glycemic control and reduction\nof hypoglycemia over 3 months of com-\nparison in children and adults with type 1\ndiabetes (21). In the International Diabe-\ntes Closed Loop (iDCL) trial, a 6-month\ntrial in people with type 1 diabetes at\nleast 14 years of age, the use of a closed-\nloop system was associated with a greater\npercentage of time spent in the target gly-\ncemic range, reduced mean glucose and\nA1C levels, and a lower percentage of time\nspent in hypoglycemia compared with use\nof a sensor-augmented pump (22).\nIntensive insulin management using a\nversion of CSII and continuous glucose\nmonitoring should be considered in most\nindividuals with type 1 diabetes. AID sys-\ntems may be considered in individuals\nwith type 1 diabetes who are capable of\nusing the device safely (either by them-\nselves or with a caregiver) in order to\nimprove time in range and reduce A1C\nand hypoglycemia (22). See Section 7,\n\u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d for a full discus-\nsion of insulin delivery devices.\nIn general, individuals with type 1 dia-\nbetes require 50% of their daily insulin\nas basal and 50% as prandial, but this is\ndependent on a number of factors, in-\ncluding whether the individual consumes\nlower or higher carbohydrate meals. To-\ntal daily insulin requirements can be esti-\nmated based on weight, with typical\ndoses ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg/\nday. Higher amounts are required during\npuberty, pregnancy, and medical illness.\nThe American Diabetes Association/JDRF\nType 1 Diabetes Sourcebook notes 0.5 units/\nkg/day as a typical starting dose in indi-\nviduals with type 1 diabetes who are\nmetabolically stable, with half adminis-\ntered as prandial insulin given to control\nblood glucose after meals and the other\nhalf as basal insulin to control glycemia\nin the periods between meal absorption\n(23); this guideline provides detailed in-\nformation on intensi\ufb01cation of therapy\nto meet individualized needs. In addi-\ntion, the American Diabetes Association\n(ADA) position statement \u201cType 1 Diabe-\ntes Management Through the Life Span\u201d\nprovides a thorough overview of type 1\ndiabetes treatment (24).\nTypical multidose regimens for individ-\nuals with type 1 diabetes combine pre-\nmeal use of shorter-acting insulins with a\nlonger-acting formulation. The long-acting\nbasal dose is titrated to regulate over-\nnight and fasting glucose. Postprandial\nglucose excursions are best controlled\nby a well-timed injection of prandial in-\nsulin. The optimal time to administer\nprandial insulin varies, based on the phar-\nmacokinetics of the formulation (regular,\nRAA, inhaled), the premeal blood glucose\nlevel, and carbohydrate consumption. Rec-\nommendations for prandial insulin dose\nadministration should therefore be individ-\nualized. Physiologic insulin secretion varies\nwith glycemia, meal size, meal composi-\ntion, and tissue demands for glucose. To\napproach this variability in people using\ninsulin treatment, strategies have evolved\nto adjust prandial doses based on pre-\ndicted needs.

    "text": "adjust prandial insulin to account for car-\nbohydrate intake, premeal glucose levels,\nand anticipated activity can be effective\nand should be offered to most individuals\n(25,26). For individuals in whom carbohy-\ndrate counting is effective, estimates of\nthe fat and protein content of meals can\nbe incorporated into their prandial dos-\ning for added bene\ufb01t (27) (see Section 5,\n\u201cFacilitating Positive Health Behaviors and\nWell-being to Improve Health Outcomes\u201d).\nThe 2021 ADA/European Association\nfor the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consen-\nsus report on the management of type 1\ndiabetes in adults summarizes different\ninsulin regimens and glucose monitoring\nstrategies in individuals with type 1 dia-\nbetes (Fig. 9.1 and Table 9.1) (5).\nInsulin Injection Technique\nEnsuring that individuals and/or caregivers\nunderstand correct insulin injection tech-\nnique is important to optimize glucose\ncontrol and insulin use safety. Thus, it is\nimportant that insulin be delivered into\nthe proper tissue in the correct way. Rec-\nommendations have been published else-\nwhere outlining best practices for insulin\ninjection (28). Proper insulin injection tech-\nnique includes injecting into appropriate\nbody areas, injection site rotation, appro-\npriate care of injection sites to avoid infec-\ntion or other complications, and avoidance\nof intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery.\nExogenously delivered insulin should be\ninjected into subcutaneous tissue, not in-\ntramuscularly. Recommended sites for in-\nsulin injection include the abdomen, thigh,\nbuttock, and upper arm. Insulin absorption\nfrom IM sites differs from that in subcuta-\nneous sites and is also in\ufb02uenced by the\nactivity of the muscle. Inadvertent IM in-\njection can lead to unpredictable insulin\nabsorption and variable effects on glucose\nand is associated with frequent and unex-\nplained hypoglycemia. Risk for IM insulin\ndelivery is increased in younger, leaner\nindividuals when injecting into the limbs\nrather than truncal sites (abdomen and\nbuttocks) and when using longer needles.\nRecent evidence supports the use of short\nneedles (e.g., 4-mm pen needles) as effec-\ntive and well tolerated when compared\nwith longer needles, including a study per-\nformed in adults with obesity (29).\nInjection site rotation is additionally nec-\nessary to avoid lipohypertrophy, an accu-\nmulation of subcutaneous fat in response to\nthe adipogenic actions of insulin at a site\nof multipleinjections. Lipohypertrophy ap-\npears as soft, smooth raised areas several\ncentimeters in breadth and can contribute\nto erratic insulin absorption, increased\nglycemic variability, and unexplained\nhypoglycemic episodes. People treated\nwith insulin and/or caregivers should\nreceive education about proper injec-\ntion site rotation and how to recognize\nand avoid areas of lipohypertrophy. As\nnoted in Table 4.1, examination of insu-\nlin injection sites for the presence of lipo-\nhypertrophy, as well as assessment of\ninjection device use and injection tech-\nnique, are key components of a compre-\nhensive diabetes medical evaluation and\ntreatment plan. Proper insulin injection\ntechnique may lead to more effective use\nof this therapy and, as such, holds the po-\ntential for improved clinical outcomes.\nNoninsulin Treatments for Type 1\nDiabetes\nInjectable and oral glucose-lowering drugs\nhave been studied for their ef\ufb01cacy as ad-\njuncts to insulin treatment of type 1 diabe-\ntes. Pramlintide is based on the naturally\noccurring b-cell peptide amylin and is ap-\nproved for use in adults with type 1 diabe-\ntes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a\nmodest reduction in A1C (0.3\u20130.4%) and\nmodest weight loss (\u00011 kg) with pram-\nlintide (30\u201333). Similarly, results have been\nreported for several agents currently ap-\nproved only for the treatment of type 2 di-\nabetes. The addition of metformin in\nadults with type 1 diabetes caused small\nreductions in body weight and lipid lev-\nels but did not improve A1C (34,35). The\nlargest clinical trials of glucagon-like pep-\ntide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in\ntype 1 diabetes have been conducted\nwith liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, showing\nmodest A1C reductions (\u00010.4%), decreases\nin weight (\u00015 kg), and reductions in insulin\ndoses (36,37). Similarly, sodium\u2013glucose co-\ntransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been\nstudied in clinical trials in people with type 1\ndiabetes, showing improvements in A1C, re-\nduced body weight, and improved blood\npressure (38\u201340); however, SGLT2 inhibitor\nuse in type 1 diabetes is associated with an\nincreased rate of diabetic ketoacidosis. The\nrisks and bene\ufb01ts of adjunctive agents\ncontinue to be evaluated, with consen-\nsus statements providing guidance on\npatient selection and precautions (41).\nSURGICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 1\nDIABETES\nPancreas and Islet Transplantation\nSuccessful pancreas and islet transplan-\ntation can normalize glucose levels and\nmitigate microvascular complications of\ntype 1 diabetes. However, people receiving\nthese treatments require lifelong immuno-\nsuppression to prevent graft rejection and/\nor recurrence of autoimmune islet destruc-\ntion. Given the potential adverse effects\nof immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas\ntransplantation should be reserved for\npeople with type 1 diabetes undergoing\nsimultaneous renal transplantation, fol-\nlowing renal transplantation, or for those\nwith recurrent ketoacidosis or severe\nhypoglycemia despite intensive glycemic\nmanagement (42).\nThe 2021 ADA/EASD consensus report\non the management of type 1 diabetes\nin adults offers a simpli\ufb01ed overview\nof indications for b-cell replacement\ntherapy in people with type 1 diabetes\n(Fig. 9.2) (5).\nPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR\nADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES\nRecommendations\n9.4a Healthy lifestyle behaviors, dia-\nbetes self-management educa-\ntion and support, avoidance of\nclinical inertia, and social deter-\nminants of health should be con-\nsidered in the glucose-lowering\nmanagement of type 2 diabetes.\nPharmacologic therapy should be\nguided by person-centered treat-\nment factors, including comor-\nbidities and treatment goals.

    "text": "safely used in people with reduced esti-\nmated glomerular \ufb01ltration rates (eGFR);\nthe FDA has revised the label for metfor-\nmin to re\ufb02ect its safety in people with\neGFR $30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (49). A ran-\ndomized trial con\ufb01rmed previous obser-\nvations that metformin use is associated\nwith vitamin B12 de\ufb01ciency and worsen-\ning of symptoms of neuropathy (50). This\nis compatible with a report from the Di-\nabetes Prevention Program Outcomes\nStudy (DPPOS) suggesting periodic test-\ning of vitamin B12 (51) (see Section 3,\n\u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes\nand Associated Comorbidities\u201d).\nWhen A1C is $1.5% (12.5 mmol/mol)\nabove the glycemic target (see Section 6,\n\u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for appropriate tar-\ngets), many individuals will require dual-\ncombination therapy or a more potent\nglucose-lowering agent to achieve and\nmaintain their target A1C level (45,52)\n(Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2). Insulin has the\nadvantage of being effective where other\nagents are not and should be considered\nas part of any combination regimen\nwhen hyperglycemia is severe, espe-\ncially if catabolic features (weight loss,\nhypertriglyceridemia, ketosis) are pre-\nsent. It is common practice to initiate in-\nsulin therapy for people who present\nwith blood glucose levels $300 mg/dL\n(16.7mmol/L)orA1C>10%(86mmol/mol)\nor if the individual has symptoms of hy-\nperglycemia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia)\nor evidence of catabolism (weight loss)\n(Fig. 9.4). As glucose toxicity resolves, sim-\nplifying the regimen and/or changing to\nnoninsulin agents is often possible. How-\never,there is evidence that people with un-\ncontrolled hyperglycemia associated with\ntype 2 diabetes can also be effectively\ntreated with a sulfonylurea (53).\nCombination Therapy\nBecause type 2 diabetes is a progressive\ndisease in many individuals, maintenance\nof glycemic targets often requires com-\nbination therapy. Traditional recommen-\ndations have been to use stepwise addition\nof medications to metformin to maintain\nA1C at target. The advantage of this is to\nprovide a clear assessment of the positive\nand negative effects of new drugs and re-\nduce potential side effects and expense\n(54). However, there are data to support\ninitial combination therapy for more rapid\nattainment of glycemic goals (55,56) and\nlater combination therapy for longer\ndurability of glycemic effect (57). The\nVERIFY (Vildagliptin Ef\ufb01cacy in combina-\ntion with metfoRmln For earlY treatment\nof type 2 diabetes) trial demonstrated\nthat initial combination therapy is supe-\nrior to sequential addition of medications\nfor extending primary and secondary fail-\nure (58). In the VERIFY trial, participants\nreceiving the initial combination of met-\nformin and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4\n(DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin had a slower\ndecline of glycemic control compared with\nmetformin alone and with vildagliptin\nadded sequentially to metformin. These\nresults have not been generalized to oral\nagents other than vildagliptin, but they\nsuggest that more intensive early treat-\nment has some bene\ufb01ts and should be\nconsidered through a shared decision-\nmaking process, as appropriate. Initial\ncombination therapy should be consid-\nered in people presenting with A1C levels\n1.5\u20132.0% above target. Finally, incorpora-\ntion of high-glycemic-ef\ufb01cacy therapies or\ntherapies for cardiovascular/renal risk re-\nduction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors)\nmay allow for weaning of the current\nregimen, particularly of agents that may\nincrease the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus,\ntreatment intensi\ufb01cation may not neces-\nsarily follow a pure sequential addition\nof therapy but instead re\ufb02ect a tailoring\nof the regimen in alignment with person-\ncentered treatment goals (Fig. 9.3).\nRecommendations for treatment in-\ntensi\ufb01cation for people not meeting\ntreatment goals should not be delayed.\nShared decision-making is important in\ndiscussions regarding treatment intensi-\n\ufb01cation. The choice of medication added\nto initial therapy is based on the clinical\ncharacteristics of the individual and their\npreferences. Important clinical character-\nistics include the presence of established\nASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk,\nHF, CKD, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,\nand risk for speci\ufb01c adverse drug effects,\nas well as safety, tolerability, and cost.\nResults from comparative effectiveness\nmeta-analyses suggest that each new\nclass of noninsulin agents added to initial\ntherapy with metformin generally lowers\nA1C approximately 0.7\u20131.0% (59,60)\n(Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2).\nFor people with type 2 diabetes and es-\ntablished ASCVD or indicators of high\nASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor\nand/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated\nCVD bene\ufb01t (see Table 9.2, Table 10.3B,\nTable 10.3C, and Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular\nDisease and Risk Management\u201d) is recom-\nmended as part of the glucose-lowering\nregimen independent of A1C, independent\nof metformin use and in consideration of\nperson-speci\ufb01c factors (Fig. 9.3). For peo-\nple without established ASCVD, indica-\ntors of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD,\nmedication choice is guided by ef\ufb01cacy\nin support of individualized glycemic and\nweight management goals, avoidance of\nside effects (particularly hypoglycemia\nand weight gain), cost/access, and indi-\nvidual preferences (61). A systematic re-\nview and network meta-analysis suggests\ngreatest reductions in A1C level with insu-\nlin regimens and speci\ufb01c GLP-1 RAs added\nto metformin-based background ther-\napy (62). In all cases, treatment regimens\nneed to be continuously reviewed for ef\ufb01-\ncacy, side effects, and burden (Table 9.2).\nIn some instances, the individual will re-\nquire medication reduction or discontinu-\nation. Common reasons for this include\nineffectiveness, intolerable side effects,\nexpense, or a change in glycemic goals (e.g.,\nin response to development of comor-\nbidities or changes in treatment goals).\nSection 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d has a full dis-\ncussion of treatment considerations in\nolder adults, in whom changes of glyce-\nmic goals and de-escalation of therapy\nare common.\nThe need for the greater potency of\ninjectable medications is common, par-\nticularly in people with a longer dura-\ntion of diabetes. The addition of basal\ninsulin, either human NPH or one of the\nlong-acting insulin analogs, to oral agent\nregimens is a well-established approach\nthat is effective for many individuals. In\naddition, evidence supports the utility\nof GLP-1 RAs in people not at glycemic\ngoal. While most GLP-1 RAs are inject-\nable, an oral formulation of semaglutide\nis commercially available (63). In trials\ncomparing the addition of an injectable\nGLP-1 RA or insulin in people needing\nfurther glucose lowering, glycemic ef\ufb01-\ncacy of injectable GLP-1 RA was similar\nor greater than that of basal insulin\n(64\u201370). GLP-1 RAs in these trials had\na lower risk of hypoglycemia and ben-\ne\ufb01cial effects on body weight com-\npared with insulin, albeit with greater\ngastrointestinal side effects. Thus, trial\nresults support GLP-1 RAs as the pre-\nferred option for individuals requiring\nthe potency of an injectable therapy for\nglucose control (Fig. 9.4).

However, cost\nand tolerability issues are important\nconsiderations in GLP-1 RA use.\nCosts for diabetes medications have\nincreased dramatically over the past two\ndecades, and an increasing proportion is\nnow passed on to patients and their fami-\nlies (71). Table 9.3 provides cost informa-\ntion for currently approved noninsulin\ntherapies. Of note, prices listed are average\nwholesale prices (AWP) (72) and National\nAverage Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC)\n(73), separate measures to allow for a\ncomparison of drug prices, but do not ac-\ncount for discounts, rebates, or other price\nadjustments often involved in prescription\nsales that affect the actual cost incurred by\nthe patient. Medication costs can be a ma-\njor source of stress for people with diabetes\nand contribute to worse medication-taking\nbehavior (74); cost-reducing strategies\nmay improve medication-taking behavior\nin some cases (75).\nCardiovascular Outcomes Trials\nThere are now multiple large randomized\ncontrolled trials reporting statistically signif-\nicant reductions in cardiovascular events in\nadults with type 2 diabetes treated with\nan SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA; see Sec-\ntion 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and Risk\nManagement\u201d for details. Participants\nenrolled in many of the cardiovascular\noutcomes trials had A1C $6.5%, with\nmore than 70% taking metformin at base-\nline, with analyses indicating bene\ufb01t with\nor without metformin (45). Thus, a practi-\ncal extension of these results to clinical\npractice is to use these medications prefer-\nentially in people with type 2 diabetes and\nestablished ASCVD or indicators of high\nASCVD risk. For these individuals, incorpo-\nrating one of the SGLT2 inhibitors and/or\nGLP-1 RAs that have been demonstrated\nto have cardiovascular disease bene\ufb01t is\nrecommended (see Fig. 9.3, Table 9.2, and\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management\u201d). Emerging data sug-\ngest that use of both classes of drugs will\nprovide additional cardiovascular and\nkidney outcomes bene\ufb01t; thus, combi-\nnation therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor\nand a GLP-1 RA may be considered to\nprovide the complementary outcomes\nbene\ufb01ts associated with these classes\nof medication (76). In cardiovascular\noutcomes trials, empagli\ufb02ozin, canagli-\n\ufb02ozin, dapagli\ufb02ozin, liraglutide, semaglu-\ntide, and dulaglutide all had bene\ufb01cial\neffects on indices of CKD, while dedicated\nrenal outcomes studies have demonstrated\nbene\ufb01t of speci\ufb01c SGLT2 inhibitors. See\nSection 11, \u201cChronic Kidney Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d for discussion of how\nCKD may impact treatment choices. Ad-\nditional large randomized trials of other\nagents in these classes are ongoing.\nInsulin Therapy\nMany adults with type 2 diabetes even-\ntually require and bene\ufb01t from insulin\ntherapy (Fig. 9.4). See the section INSULIN\nINJECTION TECHNIQUE, above, for guidance on\nhow to administer insulin safely and ef-\nfectively. The progressive nature of type 2\ndiabetes should be regularly and objec-\ntively explained to patients, and clinicians\nshould avoid using insulin as a threat or\ndescribing it as a sign of personal failure\nor punishment. Rather, the utility and im-\nportance of insulin to maintain glycemic\ncontrol once progression of the disease\novercomes the effect of other agents\nshould be emphasized. Educating and\ninvolving patients in insulin management\nis bene\ufb01cial. For example, instruction of\nindividuals with type 2 diabetes initiating\ninsulin in self-titration of insulin doses\nbased on glucose monitoring improves gly-\ncemic control (77). Comprehensive educa-\ntion regarding blood glucose monitoring,\nnutrition, and the avoidance and appro-\npriate treatment of hypoglycemia are\ncritically important in any individual using\ninsulin.\nBasal Insulin\nBasal insulin alone is the most convenient\ninitial insulin treatment and can be added\nto metformin and other noninsulin inject-\nables. Starting doses can be estimated based\non body weight (0.1\u20130.2 units/kg/day)\nand the degree of hyperglycemia, with\nindividualized titration over days to weeks\nas needed. The principal action of basal\ninsulin is to restrain hepatic glucose pro-\nduction and limit hyperglycemia overnight\nand between meals (78,79). Control of\nfasting glucose can be achieved with hu-\nman NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin\nanalog. In clinical trials, long-acting basal\nanalogs (U-100 glargine or detemir) have\nbeen demonstrated to reduce the risk of\nsymptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia\ncompared with NPH insulin (80\u201385), al-\nthough these advantages are modest and\nmay not persist (86). Longer-acting basal\nanalogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) may\nconvey a lower hypoglycemia risk com-\npared with U-100 glargine when used in\ncombination with oral agents (87\u201393).\nClinicians should be aware of the poten-\ntial for overbasalization with insulin ther-\napy. Clinical signals that may prompt\nevaluation of overbasalization include\nbasal dose greater than \u00010.5 units/kg,\nhigh bedtime\u2013morning or postprepran-\ndial glucose differential (e.g., bedtime\u2013\nmorning glucose differential $50 mg/dL),\nhypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and\nhigh variability. Indication of overbasali-\nzation should prompt reevaluation to\nfurther individualize therapy (94).\nThe cost of insulin has been rising\nsteadily over the past two decades, at a\npace severalfold that of other medical ex-\npenditures (95). This expense contributes\nsigni\ufb01cant burden to patients as insulin\nhas become a growing \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d\ncost for people with diabetes, and direct\npatient costs contribute to decrease in\nmedication-taking behavior (95). There-\nfore, consideration of cost is an impor-\ntant component of effective management.\nFor many individuals with type 2 diabetes\n(e.g., individuals with relaxed A1C goals,\nlow rates of hypoglycemia, and promi-\nnent insulin resistance, as well as those\nwith cost concerns), human insulin (NPH\nand regular) may be the appropriate\nchoice of therapy, and clinicians should\nbe familiar with its use (96). Human regu-\nlar insulin, NPH, and 70/30 NPH/regular\nproducts can be purchased for consider-\nably less than the AWP and NADAC prices\nlisted in Table 9.4 at select pharmacies. Ad-\nditionally, approval of follow-on biologics\nfor insulin glargine, the \ufb01rst interchange-\nable insulin glargine product, and generic\nversions of analog insulins may expand\ncost-effective options.\nPrandial Insulin\nMany individuals with type 2 diabetes\nrequire doses of insulin before meals, in\naddition to basal insulin, to reach glyce-\nmic targets. If the individual is not al-\nready being treated with a GLP-1 RA, a\nGLP-1 RA (either in free combination or\n\ufb01xed-ratio combination) should be consid-\nered prior to prandial insulin to further\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment\nS151\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "address prandial control and to minimize\nthe risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain\nassociated with insulin therapy (45). For\nindividuals who advance to prandial in-\nsulin, a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or\n10% of the amount of basal insulin at the\nlargest meal or the meal with the great-\nest postprandial excursion is a safe esti-\nmate for initiating therapy. The prandial\ninsulin regimen can then be intensi\ufb01ed\nbased on individual needs (Fig. 9.4). In-\ndividuals with type 2 diabetes are gen-\nerally more insulin resistant than those\nwith type 1 diabetes, require higher\ndaily doses (\u00011 unit/kg), and have lower\nrates of hypoglycemia (97). Titration can\nbe based on home glucose monitoring or\nA1C. With signi\ufb01cant additions to the pran-\ndial insulin dose, particularly with the eve-\nning meal,\nconsideration should\nbe\ngiven to decreasing basal insulin.

All\nindividuals require spirometry (FEV1)\ntesting to identify potential lung disease\nprior to and after starting inhaled insulin\ntherapy.\nCombination Injectable Therapy\nIf basal insulin has been titrated to an\nacceptable fasting blood glucose level\n(or if the dose is >0.5 units/kg/day with\nindications of need for other therapy)\nand A1C remains above target, consider\nadvancing\nto\ncombination\ninjectable\ntherapy (Fig. 9.4). This approach can use\na GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA\nadded to basal insulin or multiple doses\nof insulin. The combination of basal insu-\nlin and GLP-1 RA has potent glucose-\nlowering actions and less weight gain\nand hypoglycemia compared with inten-\nsi\ufb01ed insulin regimens (106\u2013111). The\nDUAL VIII (Durability of Insulin Degludec\nPlus Liraglutide Versus Insulin Glargine\nU100 as Initial Injectable Therapy in Type 2\nDiabetes) randomized controlled trial dem-\nonstrated greater durability of glycemic\ntreatment effect with the combination\nGLP-1 RA\u2013insulin therapy compared with\naddition of basal insulin alone (57). In se-\nlect individuals, complex insulin regimens\ncan also be simpli\ufb01ed with combination\nGLP-1 RA\u2013insulin therapy in type 2 diabe-\ntes (112). Two different once-daily, \ufb01xed\ndual combination products containing basal\ninsulin plus a GLP-1 RA are available: insulin\nglargine plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) and insu-\nlin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira).\nIntensi\ufb01cation of insulin treatment can\nbe done by adding doses of prandial insu-\nlin to basal insulin. Starting with a single\nprandial dose with the largest meal of\nthe day is simple and effective, and it can\nbe advanced to a regimen with multiple\nprandial doses if necessary (113). Alterna-\ntively, in an individual on basal insulin in\nwhom additional prandial coverage is de-\nsired, the regimen can be converted to\ntwo doses of a premixed insulin. Each ap-\nproach has advantages and disadvantages.\nFor example, basal-prandial regimens offer\ngreater \ufb02exibility for individuals who eat on\nirregular schedules. On the other hand, two\ndoses of premixed insulin is a simple, conve-\nnient means of spreading insulin across the\nday. Moreover, human insulins, separately,\nself-mixed, or as premixed NPH/regular (70/\n30) formulations, are less costly alternatives\nto insulin analogs. Figure 9.4 outlines these\noptions as well as recommendations for fur-\nther intensi\ufb01cation, if needed, to achieve\nglycemic goals.When initiating combination\ninjectable therapy, metformin therapy\nshould be maintained, while sulfonylureas\nand DPP-4 inhibitors are typically weaned\nor discontinued. In individuals with sub-\noptimal blood glucose control, especially\nthose requiring large insulin doses, ad-\njunctive use of a thiazolidinedione or an\nSGLT2 inhibitor may help to improve con-\ntrol and reduce the amount of insulin\nneeded, though potential side effects should\nbe considered. Once a basal-bolus insulin\nregimen is initiated, dose titration is im-\nportant, with adjustments made in both\nmealtime and basal insulins based on the\nblood glucose levels and an understand-\ning of the pharmacodynamic pro\ufb01le of\neach formulation (also known as pattern\ncontrol or pattern management). As peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes get older, it may\nbecome necessary to simplify complex in-\nsulin regimens because of a decline in\nself-management ability (see Section 13,\n\u201cOlder Adults\u201d).\nReferences\n1.

Common conditions coexisting with\ntype 2 diabetes (e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia) are clear risk factors for ASCVD,\nand diabetes itself confers independent risk. Numerous studies have shown the ef\ufb01-\ncacy of controlling individual cardiovascular risk factors in preventing or slowing\nASCVD in people with diabetes. Furthermore, large bene\ufb01ts are seen when multiple\ncardiovascular risk factors are addressed simultaneously. Under the current paradigm\nof aggressive risk factor modi\ufb01cation in people with diabetes, there is evidence that\nmeasures of 10-year CHD risk among U.S. adults with diabetes have improved signi\ufb01-\ncantly over the past decade (2) and that ASCVD morbidity and mortality have de-\ncreased (3,4).\nHeart failure is another major cause of morbidity and mortality from cardiovas-\ncular disease. Recent studies have found that rates of incident heart failure hospi-\ntalization (adjusted for age and sex) were twofold higher in people with diabetes\ncompared with those without (5,6). People with diabetes may have heart failure\nwith preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\nHypertension is often a precursor of heart failure of either type, and ASCVD can co-\nexist with either type (7), whereas prior myocardial infarction (MI) is often a major\nfactor in HFrEF. Rates of heart failure hospitalization have been improved in recent\ntrials including people with type 2 diabetes, most of whom also had ASCVD, with\nsodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (8\u201311).\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nThis section has received endorsement from the\nAmerican College of Cardiology.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G,\nAroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.\n10.

    "text": "A recent meta-analysis indicated that\nSGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart\nfailure hospitalization, cardiovascular mor-\ntality, and all-cause mortality in people\nwith (secondary prevention) and without\n(primary prevention) cardiovascular dis-\nease (12).\nFor prevention and management of\nboth ASCVD and heart failure, cardio-\nvascular risk factors should be systemat-\nically assessed at least annually in all\npeople with diabetes. These risk factors\ninclude duration of diabetes, obesity/\noverweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia,\nsmoking, a family history of premature\ncoronary disease, chronic kidney disease\n(CKD), and the presence of albuminuria.\nModi\ufb01able abnormal risk factors should\nbe treated as described in these guide-\nlines. Notably, the majority of evidence\nsupporting interventions to reduce car-\ndiovascular risk in diabetes comes from\ntrials of people with type 2 diabetes. No\nrandomized trials have been speci\ufb01cally\ndesigned to assess the impact of cardio-\nvascular risk reduction strategies in peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the\nrecommendations for cardiovascular risk\nfactor modi\ufb01cation for people with type 1\ndiabetes are extrapolated from data ob-\ntained in people with type 2 diabetes\nand are similar to those for people with\ntype 2 diabetes.\nAs depicted in Fig. 10.1, a comprehen-\nsive approach to the reduction in risk of\ndiabetes-related complications is recom-\nmended. Therapy that includes multiple,\nconcurrent evidence-based approaches to\ncare will provide complementary reduc-\ntion in the risks of microvascular, kidney,\nneurologic, and cardiovascular complica-\ntions. Management of glycemia, blood\npressure, and lipids and the incorpora-\ntion of speci\ufb01c therapies with cardiovas-\ncular and kidney outcomes bene\ufb01t (as\nindividually appropriate) are considered\nfundamental elements of global risk re-\nduction in diabetes.\nTHE RISK CALCULATOR\nThe American College of Cardiology/American\nHeart Association ASCVD risk calculator\n(Risk Estimator Plus) is generally a useful\ntool to estimate 10-year risk of a \ufb01rst\nASCVD event (available online at tools.\nacc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus). The\ncalculator includes diabetes as a risk fac-\ntor, since diabetes itself confers increased\nrisk for ASCVD, although it should be ac-\nknowledged that these risk calculators do\nnot account for the duration of diabetes\nor the presence of diabetes complications,\nsuch as albuminuria. Although some vari-\nability in calibration exists in various sub-\ngroups, including by sex, race, and diabetes,\nthe overall risk prediction does not differ\nin those with or without diabetes (13\u201316),\nvalidating the use of risk calculators in\npeople with diabetes. The 10-year risk of\na \ufb01rst ASCVD event should be assessed to\nbetter stratify ASCVD risk and help guide\ntherapy, as described below.\nRecently, risk scores and other cardio-\nvascular biomarkers have been devel-\noped for risk strati\ufb01cation of secondary\nprevention patients (i.e., those who are\nalready high risk because they have\nASCVD) but are not yet in widespread\nuse (17,18). With newer, more expen-\nsive lipid-lowering therapies now avail-\nable, use of these risk assessments may\nhelp target these new therapies to \u201chigher\nrisk\u201d ASCVD patients in the future.\nHYPERTENSION/BLOOD PRESSURE\nCONTROL\nHypertension is de\ufb01ned as a systolic\nblood pressure $130 mmHg or a dia-\nstolic blood pressure $80 mmHg (19).\nThis is in agreement with the de\ufb01ni-\ntion of hypertension by the American\nCollege of Cardiology and American\nHeart Association (19). Hypertension\nis common among people with either\ntype 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hypertension\nis a major risk factor for both ASCVD\nand microvascular complications.

A\nIndividuals with blood pres-\nsure $180/110 mmHg and\ncardiovascular disease could\nbe diagnosed with hyperten-\nsion at a single visit. E\n10.2\nAll people with hypertension\nand diabetes should monitor\ntheir blood pressure at home. A\nBlood pressure should be measured at ev-\nery routine clinical visit by a trained indi-\nvidual and should follow the guidelines\nestablished for the general population:\nmeasurement in the seated position, with\nfeet on the \ufb02oor and arm supported at\nheart level, after 5 min of rest. Cuff size\nshould be appropriate for the upper-arm\ncircumference. Elevated values should\npreferably be con\ufb01rmed on a separate\nday; however, in individuals with cardio-\nvascular disease and blood pressure\n$180/110 mmHg, it is reasonable to diag-\nnose hypertension at a single visit (21).\nPostural changes in blood pressure and\npulse may be evidence of autonomic neu-\nropathy and therefore require adjustment\nof blood pressure targets. Orthostatic\nblood pressure measurements should be\nchecked on initial visit and as indicated.\nHome blood pressure self-monitoring\nand 24-h ambulatory blood pressure mon-\nitoring may provide evidence of white\ncoat hypertension, masked hypertension,\nor other discrepancies between of\ufb01ce and\n\u201ctrue\u201d blood pressure (23,24). In addition\nto con\ufb01rming or refuting a diagnosis of\nhypertension, home blood pressure assess-\nment may be useful to monitor antihyper-\ntensive treatment. Studies of individuals\nwithout diabetes found that home meas-\nurements may better correlate with ASCVD\nrisk than of\ufb01ce measurements (23,24).\nMoreover, home blood pressure monitoring\nmay improve patient medication taking and\nthus help reduce cardiovascular risk (25).\nTreatment Goals\nRecommendations\n10.3\nFor people with diabetes and\nhypertension, blood pressure\ntargets should be individual-\nized through a shared decision-\nmaking process that addresses\ncardiovascular risk, potential ad-\nverse effects of antihypertensive\nmedications, and patient prefer-\nences. B\n10.4\nPeople with diabetes and\nhypertension qualify for anti-\nhypertensive drug therapy when\nthe blood pressure is persistently\nelevated $130/80 mmHg. The\non-treatment target blood pres-\nsure goal is <130/80 mmHg, if\nit can be safely attained. B\n10.5\nIn pregnant individuals with dia-\nbetes and chronic hypertension,\na blood pressure threshold of\n140/90 mmHg for initiation\nor titration of therapy is asso-\nciated with better pregnancy\noutcomes than reserving treat-\nment for severe hypertension,\nwith no increase in risk of\nsmall-for-gestational age birth\nweight. A There are limited\ndata on the optimal lower\nlimit, but therapy should be\nlessened for blood pressure\n<90/60 mmHg. E A blood\npressure target of 110\u2013135/\n85 mmHg is suggested in the\ninterest of reducing the risk\nfor accelerated maternal hyper-\ntension. A\nRandomized clinical trials have demon-\nstrated unequivocally that treatment of hy-\npertension reduces cardiovascular events\nas well as microvascular complications\n(26\u201332). There has been controversy on\nthe recommendation of a speci\ufb01c blood\npressure goal in people with diabetes.\nThe committee recognizes that there has\nbeen no randomized controlled trial to\nspeci\ufb01cally demonstrate a decreased inci-\ndence of cardiovascular events in people\nwith diabetes by targeting a blood pres-\nsure <130/80 mmHg. The recommenda-\ntion to support a blood pressure goal of\n<130/80 mmHg in people with diabetes\nis consistent with guidelines from the\nAmerican College of Cardiology and\nAmerican Heart Association (20), the In-\nternational Society of Hypertension (21),\nand the European Society of Cardiol-\nogy (22). The committee\u2019s recommen-\ndation for the blood pressure target\nof <130/80 mmHg derives primarily from\nthe collective evidence of the following\nrandomized controlled trials. The Systolic\nBlood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)\ndemonstrated that treatment to a target\nsystolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg\ndecreases cardiovascular event rates\nby 25% in high-risk patients, although\npeople with diabetes were excluded from\nthis trial (33). The recently completed\nStrategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in\nthe Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP)\ntrial included nearly 20% of people with\ndiabetes and noted decreased cardiovas-\ncular events with treatment of hyper-\ntension to a blood pressure target of\n<130 mmHg (34). While the ACCORD\n(Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in\nDiabetes) blood pressure trial (ACCORD\nBP) did not con\ufb01rm that targeting a sys-\ntolic blood pressure of <120 mmHg in\npeople with diabetes results in decreased\ncardiovascular event rates, the prespeci-\n\ufb01ed secondary outcome of stroke was re-\nduced by 41% with intensive treatment\n(35). The Action in Diabetes and Vascular\nDisease: Preterax and Diamicron MR\nControlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial\nrevealed that treatment with perindo-\npril/indapamide to an achieved systolic\nblood pressure of \u0001135 mmHg signi\ufb01-\ncantly decreased cardiovascular event\nrates compared with a placebo treat-\nment with an achieved blood pressure\nof 140 mmHg (36). Therefore, it is rec-\nommended that people with diabetes\nwho have hypertension should be\ntreated to blood pressure targets of\n<130/80 mmHg. Notably, there is an\nabsence of high-quality data available\nto guide blood pressure targets in peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes, but a similar\nblood pressure target of <130/80 mmHg\nis recommended in people with type 1\ndiabetes. As discussed below, treat-\nment should be individualized and\ntreatment should not be targeted to\n<120/80 mmHg, as a mean achieved\nblood pressure of <120/80 mmHg is\nassociated with adverse events.\nRandomized Controlled Trials of Intensive\nVersus Standard Blood Pressure Control\nSPRINT provides the strongest evidence\nto support lower blood pressure goals in\npatients at increased cardiovascular risk,\nalthough this trial excluded people with\ndiabetes (33).

The\nprimary composite outcome of myocar-\ndial infarction (MI), coronary syndromes,\nstroke, heart failure, or death from cardio-\nvascular causes was reduced by 25% in\nthe intensive treatment group. The\nachieved systolic blood pressures in the\ntrial were 121 mmHg and 136 mmHg in\nthe intensive versus standard treatment\ngroup, respectively. Adverse outcomes,\nincluding hypotension, syncope, electro-\nlyte abnormality, and acute kidney injury\nwere more common in the intensive\ntreatment arm; risk of adverse outcomes\nneeds to be weighed against the cardio-\nvascular bene\ufb01t of more intensive blood\npressure lowering.\nACCORD BP provides the strongest di-\nrect assessment of the bene\ufb01ts and risks\nof intensive blood pressure control in peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes (35). In the study,\na total of 4,733 with type 2 diabetes were\nassigned to intensive therapy (targeting a\nsystolic blood pressure <120 mmHg) or\nstandard therapy (targeting a systolic\nblood pressure <140 mmHg). The mean\nachieved systolic blood pressures were\n119 mmHg and 133 mmHg in the inten-\nsive versus standard group, respectively.\nThe primary composite outcome of non-\nfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or death from\ncardiovascular causes was not signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced in the intensive treatment group.\nThe prespeci\ufb01ed secondary outcome of\nstroke was signi\ufb01cantly reduced by 41% in\nthe intensive treatment group. Adverse\nevents attributed to blood pressure treat-\nment, including hypotension, syncope,\nbradycardia, hyperkalemia, and eleva-\ntions in serum creatinine occurred more\nfrequently in the intensive treatment arm\nthan in the standard therapy arm (Table\n10.1).\nOf note, the ACCORD BP and SPRINT\ntrials targeted a similar systolic blood\npressure <120 mmHg, but in contrast to\nSPRINT, the primary composite cardio-\nvascular end point was nonsigni\ufb01cantly\nreduced in ACCORD BP. The results have\nbeen interpreted to be generally consis-\ntent between both trials, but ACCORD\nBP was viewed as underpowered due to\nthe composite primary end point being less\nsensitive to blood pressure regulation (33).\nThe more recent STEP trial assigned\n8,511 patients aged 60\u201380 years with\nhypertension to a systolic blood pres-\nsure target of 110 to <130 mmHg (in-\ntensive treatment) or a target of 130 to\n<150 mmHg (34). In this trial, the pri-\nmary composite outcome of stroke,\nacute coronary syndrome, acute decom-\npensated heart failure, coronary revas-\ncularization, atrial \ufb01brillation, or death\nfrom cardiovascular causes was reduced\nby 26% in the intensive treatment\ngroup. In this trial, 18.9% of patients in\nthe intensive treatment arm and 19.4%\nin the standard treatment arm had a di-\nagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Hypotension\noccurred more frequently in the inten-\nsive treatment group (3.4%) compared\nwith the standard treatment group\n(2.6%), without signi\ufb01cant differences\nin other adverse events, including dizzi-\nness, syncope, or fractures.\nIn ADVANCE, 11,140 people with type 2\ndiabetes were randomized to receive ei-\nther treatment with \ufb01xed combination\nperindopril/indapamide or matching pla-\ncebo (36). The primary end point, a com-\nposite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal\nstroke infarction, or worsening renal or\ndiabetic eye disease, was reduced by 9%\nin the combination treatment. The achieved\nsystolic blood pressure was \u0001135 mmHg in\nthe treatment group and 140 mmHg in the\nplacebo group.\nThe Hypertension Optimal Treatment\n(HOT) trial enrolled 18,790 patients and tar-\ngeted diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg,\n<85 mmHg, or <80 mmHg (37). The car-\ndiovascular event rates, de\ufb01ned as fatal or\nnonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal strokes, and\nall other cardiovascular events, were not\nsigni\ufb01cantly different between diastolic\nblood pressure targets (#90 mmHg,\n#85 mmHg, and #80 mmHg), although\nthe lowest incidence of cardiovascular\nevents occurred with an achieved dia-\nstolic blood pressure of 82 mmHg. How-\never, in people with diabetes, there was a\nsigni\ufb01cant 51% reduction in the treatment\ngroup with a target diastolic blood pressure\nof <80 mmHg compared with a target dia-\nstolic blood pressure of <90 mmHg.\nMeta-analyses of Trials\nTo clarify optimal blood pressure targets\nin people with diabetes, multiple meta-\nanalyses have been performed. One of\nthe largest meta-analyses included 73,913\npeople with diabetes. Compared with a\nless tight blood pressure control, alloca-\ntion to a tighter blood pressure control\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduced the risk of stroke by\n31% but did not reduce the risk of MI\n(38). Another meta-analysis of 19 trials in-\ncluding 44,989 patients showed that a\nmean blood pressure of 133/76 mmHg is\nassociated with a 14% risk reduction for\nmajor cardiovascular events compared with\na mean blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg\n(32). This bene\ufb01t was greatest in people\nwith diabetes. An analysis of trials includ-\ning people with type 2 diabetes and im-\npaired glucose tolerance with achieved\nsystolic blood pressures of <135 mmHg\nin the intensive blood pressure treatment\ngroup and <140 mmHg in the standard\ntreatment group revealed a 10% reduc-\ntion in all-cause mortality and a 17% re-\nduction in stroke (30). More intensive\nreduction to <130 mmHg was associated\nwith a further reduction in stroke but not\nother cardiovascular events.\nSeveral meta-analyses strati\ufb01ed clinical\ntrials by mean baseline blood pressure or\nmean blood pressure attained in the in-\ntervention (or intensive treatment) arm.\nBased on these analyses, antihyperten-\nsive treatment appears to be most bene-\n\ufb01cial when mean baseline blood pressure\nis $140/90 mmHg (19,26,27,29\u201331).\nAmong trials with lower baseline or at-\ntained blood pressure, antihypertensive\ntreatment reduced the risk of stroke, reti-\nnopathy, and albuminuria, but effects on\nother ASCVD outcomes and heart failure\nwere not evident.\nIndividualization of Treatment Targets\nPatients and clinicians should engage in\na shared decision-making process to de-\ntermine individual blood pressure tar-\ngets (19). This approach acknowledges\nthat the bene\ufb01ts and risks of intensive\nblood pressure targets are uncertain\nand may vary across patients and is con-\nsistent with a patient-focused approach\nto care that values patient priorities and\nhealth care professional judgment (39).\nSecondary analyses of ACCORD BP and\nSPRINT suggest that clinical factors can\nhelp determine individuals more likely to\nbene\ufb01t and less likely to be harmed by in-\ntensive blood pressure control (40,41).\nAbsolute bene\ufb01t from blood pressure\nreduction correlated with absolute base-\nline cardiovascular risk in SPRINT and in\nearlier clinical trials conducted at higher\nbaseline blood pressure levels (13,41).\nExtrapolation of these studies suggests\nthat people with diabetes may also be\nmore likely to bene\ufb01t from intensive blood\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nS161\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "blood pressure lowering decreased the\nrisk of cardiovascular events irrespective\nof baseline diastolic blood pressure in\npatients who also received standard gly-\ncemic control (44). Therefore, the pres-\nence of low diastolic blood pressure is\nnot necessarily a contraindication to\nmore intensive blood pressure man-\nagement in the context of otherwise\nstandard care.\nPregnancy and Antihypertensive Medications\nThere are few randomized controlled trials\nof antihypertensive therapy in pregnant\nindividuals with diabetes. A 2014 Co-\nchrane systematic review of antihyperten-\nsive therapy for mild to moderate chronic\nhypertension that included 49 trials and\nover 4,700 women did not \ufb01nd any con-\nclusive evidence for or against blood pres-\nsure treatment to reduce the risk of\npreeclampsia for the mother or effects on\nperinatal outcomes such as preterm birth,\nsmall-for-gestational-age infants, or fetal\ndeath (45). The Control of Hypertension\nin Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) (46) enrolled\nmostly women with chronic hyperten-\nsion. In CHIPS, targeting a diastolic blood\npressure of 85 mmHg during pregnancy\nwas associated with reduced likelihood\nof developing accelerated maternal hy-\npertension and no demonstrable ad-\nverse outcome for infants compared\nwith targeting a higher diastolic blood\npressure. The mean systolic blood pressure\nachieved in the more intensively treated\ngroup was 133.1 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg, and the\nmean diastolic blood pressure achieved in\nthat group was 85.3 \u00b1 0.3 mmHg. A similar\napproach is supported by the International\nSociety for the Study of Hypertension in\nPregnancy, which speci\ufb01cally recommends\nuse of antihypertensive therapy to main-\ntain systolic blood pressure between 110\nand 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pres-\nsure between 80 and 85 mmHg (47).\nThe more recent Chronic Hyperten-\nsion and Pregnancy (CHAP) trial assigned\npregnant individuals with mild chronic\nhypertension to antihypertensive medi-\ncations to target a blood pressure goal\nof <140/90 mmHg (active treatment\ngroup) or to control treatment, in which\nantihypertensive therapy was withheld\nunless severe hypertension (systolic pres-\nsure $160 mmHg or diastolic pressure\n$105 mmHg) developed (control group)\n(48). The primary outcome, a composite\nof preeclampsia with severe features,\nmedically indicated preterm birth at\n<35 weeks of gestation, placental abrup-\ntion, or fetal/neonatal death, occurred in\n30.2% of female participants in the ac-\ntive treatment group vs. 37.0% in the\ncontrol group (P < 0.001). The mean\nsystolic blood pressure between ran-\ndomization and delivery was 129.5 mmHg\nin the active treatment group and\n132.6 mmHg in the control group.\nCurrent evidence supports controlling\nblood pressure to 110\u2013135/85 mmHg to\nreduce the risk of accelerated maternal\nhypertension but also to minimize impair-\nment of fetal growth. During pregnancy,\ntreatment with ACE inhibitors, angioten-\nsin receptor blockers (ARBs), and spirono-\nlactone are contraindicated as they may\ncause fetal damage. Special consider-\nation should be taken for individuals\nof childbearing potential, and people\nintending to become pregnant should\nswitch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB or\nspironolactone to an alternative anti-\nhypertensive medication approved dur-\ning pregnancy. Antihypertensive drugs\nknown to be effective and safe in preg-\nnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, and\nlong-acting nifedipine, while hydralzine\nmay be considered in the acute manage-\nment of hypertension in pregnancy or\nsevere preeclampsia (49). Diuretics are\nnot recommended for blood pressure\ncontrol in pregnancy but may be used\nduring late-stage pregnancy if needed\nfor volume control (49,50). The American\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-\ngists also recommends that postpartum\nindividuals with gestational hypertension,\npreeclampsia, and superimposed pre-\neclampsia have their blood pressures\nobserved for 72 h in the hospital and\nfor 7\u201310 days postpartum. Long-term\nfollow-up is recommended for these\nindividuals as they have increased life-\ntime cardiovascular risk (51). See Sec-\ntion 15, \u201cManagement of Diabetes in\nPregnancy,\u201d for additional information.\nTreatment Strategies\nLifestyle Intervention\nRecommendation\n10.6\nFor people with blood pressure\n>120/80 mmHg, lifestyle inter-\nvention consists of weight loss\nwhen indicated, a Dietary Ap-\nproaches to Stop Hypertension\n(DASH)-style eating pattern in-\ncluding reducing sodium and\nincreasing potassium intake,\nmoderation of alcohol in-\ntake, and increased physi-\ncal activity. A\nLifestyle management is an important\ncomponent of hypertension treatment\nbecause it lowers blood pressure, enhan-\nces the effectiveness of some antihyper-\ntensive medications, promotes other\naspects of metabolic and vascular health,\nand generally leads to few adverse ef-\nfects. Lifestyle therapy consists of reduc-\ning excess body weight through caloric\nrestriction (see Section 8, \u201cObesity and\nWeight Management for the Prevention\nand Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\u201d), at\nleast 150 min of moderate-intensity aer-\nobic activity per week (see Section 3,\n\u201cPrevention or Delay of Type 2 Diabetes\nand Associated Comorbidities\u201d), restricting\nsodium intake (<2,300 mg/day), increasing\nconsumption of fruits and vegetables (8\u201310\nservings per day) and low-fat dairy\nproducts (2\u20133 servings per day), avoiding\nexcessive alcohol consumption (no more\nthan 2 servings per day in men and no\nmore than 1 serving per day in women)\n(52), and increasing activity levels (53)\n(see Section 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes\u201d).\nThese lifestyle interventions are rea-\nsonable for individuals with diabetes and\nmildly elevated blood pressure (systolic\n>120 mmHg or diastolic >80 mmHg)\nand should be initiated along with phar-\nmacologic therapy when hypertension is\ndiagnosed (Fig. 10.2) (53). A lifestyle\ntherapy plan should be developed in\ncollaboration with the patient and\ndiscussed as part of diabetes man-\nagement. Use of internet or mobile-\nbased digital platforms to reinforce\nhealthy behaviors may be considered\nas a component of care, as these in-\nterventions have been found to en-\nhance the ef\ufb01cacy of medical therapy\nfor hypertension (54,55).\nPharmacologic Interventions\nRecommendations\n10.7\nIndividuals with con\ufb01rmed\nof\ufb01ce-based blood pressure\n$130/80 mmHg qualify for\ninitiation and titration of phar-\nmacologic therapy to achieve\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nS163\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

A\n10.11 An ACE inhibitor or angiotensin\nreceptor\nblocker,\nat\nthe\nmaximum tolerated dose in-\ndicated for blood pressure\ntreatment,\nis\nthe\nrecom-\nmended \ufb01rst-line treatment\nfor hypertension in people\nwith diabetes and urinary\nalbumin-to-creatinine\nratio\n$300 mg/g creatinine A or\n30\u2013299 mg/g creatinine.

B\n10.12 For patients treated with\nan ACE inhibitor, angiotensin\nreceptor blocker, or diuretic,\nserum creatinine/estimated\nglomerular \ufb01ltration rate and\nserum potassium levels should\nbe monitored at least annually. B\nInitial Number of Antihypertensive Medi-\ncations. Initial treatment for people with\ndiabetes depends on the severity of hy-\npertension (Fig. 10.2). Those with blood\npressure between 130/80 mmHg and\n160/100 mmHg may begin with a single\ndrug. For patients with blood pressure\n$160/100 mmHg, initial pharmacologic\ntreatment with two antihypertensive\nmedications is recommended in order to\nmore effectively achieve adequate blood\npressure control (56\u201358). Single-pill anti-\nhypertensive combinations may improve\nmedication taking in some patients (59).\nClasses of Antihypertensive Medications.\nInitial treatment for hypertension should\ninclude any of the drug classes demon-\nstrated to reduce cardiovascular events\nin people with diabetes: ACE inhibitors\n(60,61), ARBs (60,61), thiazide-like diu-\nretics (62), or dihydropyridine calcium\nchannel blockers (63). In people with dia-\nbetes and established coronary artery\ndisease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are\nrecommended \ufb01rst-line therapy for\nhypertension (64\u201366). For patients with\nalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine\nratio [UACR] $30 mg/g), initial treatment\nshould include an ACE inhibitor or ARB to\nreduce the risk of progressive kidney dis-\nease (20) (Fig. 10.2). In patients receiving\nACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, continua-\ntion of those medications as kidney func-\ntion declines to estimated glomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2\nmay provide cardiovascular bene\ufb01t with-\nout signi\ufb01cantly increasing the risk of\nend-stage kidney disease (67). In the ab-\nsence of albuminuria, risk of progressive\nkidney disease is low, and ACE inhibitors\nand ARBs have not been found to afford\nsuperior cardioprotection when compared\nwith thiazide-like diuretics or dihydro-\npyridine calcium channel blockers (68).\nb-Blockers are indicated in the setting\nof prior MI, active angina, or HfrEF but\nhave not been shown to reduce mortality\nas blood pressure-lowering agents in the\nabsence of these conditions (28,69,70).\nMultiple-Drug Therapy. Multiple-drug ther-\napy is often required to achieve blood\npressure targets (Fig. 10.2), particularly\nin the setting of diabetic kidney disease.\nHowever, the use of both ACE inhibitors\nand ARBs in combination, or the combi-\nnation of an ACE inhibitor or ARB and a\ndirect renin inhibitor, is contraindicated\ngiven the lack of added ASCVD bene\ufb01t\nand increased rate of adverse events\u2014\nnamely, hyperkalemia, syncope, and acute\nkidney injury (AKI) (71\u201373). Titration of\nand/or addition of further blood pressure\nmedications should be made in a timely\nfashion to overcome therapeutic inertia\nin achieving blood pressure targets.\nBedtime Dosing. Although prior analyses\nof randomized clinical trials found a ben-\ne\ufb01t to evening versus morning dosing\nof antihypertensive medications (74,75),\nthese results have not been reproduced\nin subsequent trials. Therefore, preferen-\ntial use of antihypertensives at bedtime\nis not recommended (76).\nHyperkalemia and Acute Kidney Injury.\nTreatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs\ncan cause AKI and hyperkalemia, while\ndiuretics can cause AKI and either hypo-\nkalemia or hyperkalemia (depending on\nmechanism of action) (77,78). Detection\nand management of these abnormalities\nis important because AKI and hyperkale-\nmia each increase the risks of cardiovas-\ncular events and death (79). Therefore,\nserum creatinine and potassium should\nbe monitored during treatment with an\nACE inhibitor, ARB, or diuretic, particularly\namong patients with reduced glomerular\n\ufb01ltration who are at increased risk of hy-\nperkalemia and AKI (77,78,80).\nResistant Hypertension\nRecommendation\n10.13 Individuals with hypertension\nwho are not meeting blood\npressure targets on three clas-\nses of antihypertensive medi-\ncations (including a diuretic)\nshould be considered for min-\neralocorticoid receptor antago-\nnist therapy. A\nResistant hypertension is de\ufb01ned as\nblood pressure $140/90 mmHg despite\na therapeutic strategy that includes ap-\npropriate lifestyle management plus a\ndiuretic and two other antihypertensive\ndrugs with complementary mechanisms\nof action at adequate doses. Prior to\ndiagnosing\nresistant\nhypertension,\na\nnumber of other conditions should be\nexcluded, including missed doses of anti-\nhypertensive medications, white coat hy-\npertension, and secondary hypertension.\nIn general, barriers to medication taking\n(such as cost and side effects) should\nbe identi\ufb01ed and addressed (Fig. 10.2).\nMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,\nincluding spironolactone and eplere-\nnone, are effective for management of\nresistant hypertension in people with\ntype 2 diabetes when added to exist-\ning treatment with an ACE inhibitor or\nARB, thiazide-like diuretic, or dihydro-\npyridine calcium channel blocker (81).\nIn addition, mineralocorticoid receptor\nantagonists reduce albuminuria in peo-\nple with diabetic nephropathy (82\u201384).\nHowever, adding a mineralocorticoid re-\nceptor antagonist to a regimen including\nan ACE inhibitor or ARB may increase\nthe risk for hyperkalemia, emphasizing\nthe importance of regular monitoring for\nserum creatinine and potassium in these\npatients, and long-term outcome studies\nare needed to better evaluate the role\nof mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists\nin blood pressure management.\nLIPID MANAGEMENT\nLifestyle Intervention\nRecommendations\n10.14 Lifestyle modi\ufb01cation focusing\non weight loss (if indicated);\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nS165\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Initiating Statin Therapy Based on Risk\nPeople with type 2 diabetes have an in-\ncreased prevalence of lipid abnormali-\nties, contributing to their high risk of\nASCVD. Multiple clinical trials have dem-\nonstrated the bene\ufb01cial effects of statin\ntherapy on ASCVD outcomes in subjects\nwith and without CHD (90,91). Sub-\ngroup analyses of people with diabetes\nin larger trials (92\u201396) and trials in peo-\nple with diabetes (97,98) showed signi\ufb01-\ncant primary and secondary prevention\nof ASCVD events and CHD death in peo-\nple with diabetes. Meta-analyses, includ-\ning data from over 18,000 people with\ndiabetes from 14 randomized trials of\nstatin therapy (mean follow-up 4.3 years),\ndemonstrate a 9% proportional reduction\nin all-cause mortality and 13% reduction\nin vascular mortality for each 1 mmol/L\n(39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol\n(99). The cardiovascular bene\ufb01t in this\nlarge meta-analysis did not depend on\nbaseline LDL cholesterol levels and was\nlinearly related to the LDL cholesterol re-\nduction without a low threshold beyond\nwhich there was no bene\ufb01t observed (99).\nAccordingly, statins are the drugs of\nchoice for LDL cholesterol lowering and\ncardioprotection. Table 10.2 shows the\ntwo statin dosing intensities that are rec-\nommended for use in clinical practice:\nhigh-intensity statin therapy will achieve\napproximately a $50% reduction in LDL\ncholesterol, and moderate-intensity statin\nregimens achieve 30\u201349% reductions in\nLDL cholesterol. Low-dose statin therapy\nis generally not recommended in people\nwith diabetes but is sometimes the only\ndose of statin that a patient can tolerate.\nFor patients who do not tolerate the in-\ntended intensity of statin, the maximum\ntolerated statin dose should be used.\nAs in those without diabetes, abso-\nlute reductions in ASCVD outcomes (CHD\ndeath and nonfatal MI) are greatest\nin people with high baseline ASCVD risk\n(known ASCVD and/or very high LDL\ncholesterol levels), but the overall bene-\n\ufb01ts of statin therapy in people with dia-\nbetes at moderate or even low risk for\nASCVD are convincing (100,101). The rela-\ntive bene\ufb01t of lipid-lowering therapy has\nbeen uniform across most subgroups tested\n(91,99), including subgroups that varied\nwith respect to age and other risk factors.\nPrimary Prevention (People Without ASCVD)\nFor primary prevention, moderate-dose\nstatin therapy is recommended for those\naged $40 years (93,100,101), although\nhigh-intensity therapy should be consid-\nered in the context of additional ASCVD\nrisk factors. The evidence is strong for\npeople with diabetes aged 40\u201375 years,\nan age-group well represented in statin\ntrials showing bene\ufb01t. Since cardiovascu-\nlar risk is enhanced in people with diabe-\ntes, as noted above, patients who also\nhave multiple other coronary risk factors\nhave increased risk, equivalent to that\nof those with ASCVD. Therefore, current\nguidelines recommend that in people\nwith diabetes who are at higher cardio-\nvascular risk, especially those with one or\nmore ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity\nstatin therapy should be prescribed to re-\nduce LDL cholesterol by $50% from\nbaseline and to target an LDL cholesterol\nof <70 mg/dL (102\u2013104). Since in clinical\npractice it is frequently dif\ufb01cult to ascer-\ntain the baseline LDL cholesterol level\nprior to statin therapy initiation, in those\nindividuals, a focus on an LDL cholesterol\ntarget level of <70 mg/dL rather than\nthe percent reduction in LDL cholesterol\nis recommended. In those individuals, it\nmay also be reasonable to add ezetimibe\nor proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin\ntype 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor therapy to maxi-\nmum tolerated statin therapy if needed\nto reduce LDL cholesterol levels by $50%\nand to achieve the recommended LDL\ncholesterol target of <70 mg/dL (14).\nThe evidence is lower for patients aged\n>75 years; relatively few older people\nwith diabetes have been enrolled in\nprimary prevention trials. However, het-\nerogeneity by age has not been seen in\nthe relative bene\ufb01t of lipid-lowering ther-\napy in trials that included older partici-\npants (91,98,99), and because older age\nconfers higher risk, the absolute bene\ufb01ts\nare actually greater (91,105). Moderate-\nintensity statin therapy is recommended\nin people with diabetes who are $75 years\nof age. However, the risk-bene\ufb01t pro-\n\ufb01le should be routinely evaluated in\nthis population, with downward titra-\ntion of dose performed as needed. See\nSection 13, \u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for more de-\ntails on clinical considerations for this\npopulation.\nAge <40 Years and/or Type 1 Diabetes. Very\nlittle clinical trial evidence exists for\npeople with type 2 diabetes under the\nage of 40 years or for people with type\ndiabetes of any age. For pediatric rec-\nommendations, see Section 14, \u201cChildren\nand Adolescents.\u201d In the Heart Protec-\ntion Study (lower age limit 40 years), the\nsubgroup of \u0001600 people with type 1\ndiabetes had a proportionately similar,\nalthough not statistically signi\ufb01cant, re-\nduction in risk to that in people with\ntype 2 diabetes (93). Even though the\ndata are not de\ufb01nitive, similar statin\ntreatment approaches should be consid-\nered for people with type 1 or type 2\ndiabetes, particularly in the presence of\nother cardiovascular risk factors. Pa-\ntients <40 years of age have lower risk\nof developing a cardiovascular event\nover a 10-year horizon; however, their\nlifetime risk of developing cardiovascu-\nlar disease and suffering an MI, stroke,\nor cardiovascular death is high. For peo-\nple who are <40 years of age and/or\nhave type 1 diabetes with other ASCVD\nrisk factors, it is recommended that the\npatient and health care professional dis-\ncuss the relative bene\ufb01ts and risks and\nconsider the use of moderate-intensity\nstatin therapy.

High-\nintensity statin therapy is recommended\nfor all people with diabetes and ASCVD\nto target an LDL cholesterol reduction of\n$50% from baseline and an LDL choles-\nterol goal of <55 mg/dL. Based on the\nevidence discussed below, addition of\nezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor is recom-\nmended if this goal is not achieved on\nmaximum tolerated statin therapy. These\nrecommendations are based on the ob-\nservation that high-intensity versus mod-\nerate-intensity statin therapy reduces\ncardiovascular event rates in high-risk in-\ndividuals with established cardiovascular\ndisease in randomized trials (95,107). In\naddition, the Cholesterol Treatment Tria-\nlists\u2019 Collaboration involving 26 statin tri-\nals, of which 5 compared high-intensity\nversus moderate-intensity statins (99),\nshowed a 21% reduction in major cardio-\nvascular events in people with diabetes\nfor every 39 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol\nlowering, irrespective of baseline LDL\ncholesterol or patient characteristics (99).\nHowever, the best evidence to support\nlower LDL cholesterol targets in people\nwith diabetes and established cardiovas-\ncular disease derives from multiple large\nrandomized trials investigating the bene-\n\ufb01ts of adding nonstatin agents to statin\ntherapy. As discussed in detail below,\nthese include combination treatment\nwith statins and ezetimibe (105,109) or\nPCSK9 inhibitors (108,110\u2013112). Each trial\nfound a signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t in the reduc-\ntion of ASCVD events that was directly\nrelated to the degree of further LDL\ncholesterol lowering. These large trials\nincluded a signi\ufb01cant number of partici-\npants with diabetes and prespeci\ufb01ed anal-\nyses on cardiovascular outcomes in people\nwith and without diabetes (109,111,112).\nThe decision to add a nonstatin agent\nshould be made following a clinician-\npatient discussion about the net bene\ufb01t,\nsafety, and cost of combination therapy.\nCombination Therapy for LDL\nCholesterol Lowering\nStatins and Ezetimibe\nThe\nIMProved\nReduction\nof\nOut-\ncomes: Vytorin Ef\ufb01cacy International Trial\n(IMPROVE-IT) was a randomized con-\ntrolled trial in 18,144 patients comparing\nthe addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin\ntherapy versus simvastatin alone (105).\nIndividuals were $50 years of age, had\nexperienced a recent acute coronary syn-\ndrome (ACS) and were treated for an av-\nerage of 6 years. Overall, the addition of\nezetimibe led to a 6.4% relative bene\ufb01t\nand a 2% absolute reduction in major ad-\nverse cardiovascular events (atheroscle-\nrotic cardiovascular events), with the\ndegree of bene\ufb01t being directly propor-\ntional to the change in LDL cholesterol,\nwhich was 70 mg/dL in the statin group\non average and 54 mg/dL in the combi-\nnation group (105). In those with diabetes\n(27% of participants), the combination of\nmoderate-intensity simvastatin (40 mg)\nand ezetimibe (10 mg) showed a signi\ufb01-\ncant reduction of major adverse cardio-\nvascular events with an absolute risk\nreduction of 5% (40% vs. 45% cumula-\ntive incidence at 7 years) and a relative\nrisk reduction of 14% (hazard ratio [HR]\n0.86 [95% CI 0.78\u20130.94]) over moderate-\nintensity simvastatin (40 mg) alone (109).\nStatins and PCSK9 Inhibitors\nPlacebo-controlled trials evaluating the\naddition of the PCSK9 inhibitors evolo-\ncumab and alirocumab to maximum\ntolerated doses of statin therapy in par-\nticipants who were at high risk for\nASCVD demonstrated an average reduc-\ntion in LDL cholesterol ranging from 36\nto 59%. These agents have been approved\nas adjunctive therapy for individuals with\nASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia\nwho are receiving maximum tolerated\nstatin therapy but require additional\nlowering of LDL cholesterol (113,114).\nNo cardiovascular outcome trials have\nbeen performed to assess whether PCSK9\ninhibitor therapy reduces ASCVD event\nrates in individuals without established car-\ndiovascular disease (primary prevention).\nThe effects of PCSK9 inhibition on\nASCVD outcomes was investigated in\nthe Further Cardiovascular Outcomes\nResearch With PCSK9 Inhibition in Sub-\njects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial,\nwhich enrolled 27,564 individuals with\nprior ASCVD and an additional high-risk\nfeature who were receiving their maxi-\nmum tolerated statin therapy (two-\nthirds were on high-intensity statin) but\nwho still had LDL cholesterol $70 mg/dL\nor non-HDL cholesterol $100 mg/dL\n(108). Patients were randomized to re-\nceive subcutaneous injections of evolo-\ncumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks or\n420 mg every month based on patient\npreference) versus placebo. Evolocumab\nreduced LDL cholesterol by 59% from a\nmedian of 92 to 30 mg/dL in the treat-\nment arm.\nDuring the median follow-up of 2.2 years,\nthe composite outcome of cardiovascu-\nlar death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for\nangina, or revascularization occurred in\n11.3% vs. 9.8% of the placebo and evo-\nlocumab groups, respectively, represent-\ning a 15% relative risk reduction (P <\n0.001). The combined end point of car-\ndiovascular death, MI, or stroke was re-\nduced by 20%, from 7.4 to 5.9% (P <\n0.001). Evolocumab therapy also signi\ufb01-\ncantly reduced all strokes (1.5% vs.\n1.9%; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.66\u20130.95]; P =\n0.01) and ischemic stroke (1.2% vs.\n1.6%; HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.62\u20130.92]; P =\n0.005) in the total population, with \ufb01nd-\nings being consistent in individuals with\nor without a history of ischemic stroke\nat baseline (115). Importantly, similar\nbene\ufb01ts were seen in a prespeci\ufb01ed\nsubgroup of people with diabetes, com-\nprising 11,031 patients (40% of the trial)\n(112).\nIn the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evalu-\nation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an\nAcute Coronary Syndrome During Treat-\nment With Alirocumab), 18,924 patients\n(28.8% of whom had diabetes) with recent\nacute coronary syndrome were random-\nized to the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab or\nplacebo every 2 weeks in addition to max-\nimum tolerated statin therapy, with aliro-\ncumab dosing titrated between 75 and\n150 mg to achieve LDL cholesterol levels\nbetween 25 and 50 mg/dL (110). Over a\nmedian follow-up of 2.8 years, a compos-\nite primary end point (comprising death\nfrom CHD, nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal\nischemic stroke, or unstable angina re-\nquiring hospital admission) occurred in\n903 patients (9.5%) in the alirocumab\ngroup and in 1,052 patients (11.1%) in\nthe placebo group (HR 0.85 [95% CI\n0.78\u20130.93]; P < 0.001). Combination ther-\napy with alirocumab plus statin therapy\nresulted in a greater absolute reduction\nin the incidence of the primary end point\nin people with diabetes (2.3% [95% CI\n0.4\u20134.2]) than in those with prediabetes\n(1.2% [0.0\u20132.4]) or normoglycemia (1.2%\n[\u20130.3 to 2.7]) (111).\nIn addition to monoclonal antibodies\ntargeting PCSK9, the siRNA inclisiran has\nbeen developed and has recently become\navailable in the U.S. In the Inclisiran for\nS168\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Incli-\nsiran allows less frequent administration\ncompared with monoclonal antibodies\nand was administered on day 1, on\nday 90, and every 6 months in these\ntrials. In the ORION-10 trial, 47.5% of\npatients in the inclisiran group and\n42.4% in the placebo group had diabe-\ntes; in the ORION-11 trial, 36.5% of\npatients in the inclisiran group and\n33.7% in the placebo group had diabe-\ntes. The coprimary end point of placebo-\ncorrected percentage change in LDL\ncholesterol level from baseline to day\n510 was 52.3% in the ORION-10 trial\nand 49.9% in the ORION-11 trial.

A car-\ndiovascular outcome trial using inclisiran\nin people with established cardiovascular\ndisease is currently ongoing (117).\nStatins and Bempedoic Acid\nBempedoic acid is a novel LDL cholesterol\u2013\nlowering agent that is indicated as an\nadjunct to diet and maximum tolerated\nstatin therapy for the treatment of adults\nwith heterozygous familial hypercholester-\nolemia or established ASCVD who require\nadditional lowering of LDL cholesterol. A\npooled analysis suggests that bempedoic\nacid therapy lowers LDL cholesterol levels\nby about 23% compared with placebo\n(118). At this time, there are no com-\npleted trials demonstrating a cardiovas-\ncular outcomes bene\ufb01t to use of this\nmedication; however, this agent may be\nconsidered for patients who cannot use\nor tolerate other evidence-based LDL\ncholesterol-lowering approaches, or for\nwhom those other therapies are inade-\nquately effective (119).\nTreatment of Other Lipoprotein\nFractions or Targets\nRecommendations\n10.28 For individuals with fasting tri-\nglyceride levels $500 mg/dL,\nevaluate for secondary causes\nof hypertriglyceridemia and\nconsider medical therapy to re-\nduce the risk of pancreatitis. C\n10.29 In adults with moderate hyper-\ntriglyceridemia (fasting or non-\nfasting triglycerides 175\u2013499\nmg/dL), clinicians should ad-\ndress and treat lifestyle fac-\ntors (obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome), secondary factors\n(diabetes, chronic liver or kid-\nney disease and/or nephrotic\nsyndrome, hypothyroidism),\nand medications that raise\ntriglycerides. C\n10.30 In individuals with atheroscle-\nrotic cardiovascular disease or\nother cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors on a statin with controlled\nLDL cholesterol but elevated\ntriglycerides (135\u2013499 mg/dL),\nthe addition of icosapent ethyl\ncan be considered to reduce\ncardiovascular risk. A\nHypertriglyceridemia should be addressed\nwith dietary and lifestyle changes includ-\ning weight loss and abstinence from alco-\nhol (120). Severe hypertriglyceridemia\n(fasting triglycerides $500 mg/dL and\nespecially >1,000 mg/dL) may warrant\npharmacologic therapy (\ufb01bric acid de-\nrivatives and/or \ufb01sh oil) and reduction\nin dietary fat to reduce the risk of acute\npancreatitis. Moderate- or high-intensity\nstatin therapy should also be used as in-\ndicated to reduce risk of cardiovascular\nevents (see statin treatment). In people\nwith moderate hypertriglyceridemia,\nlifestyle interventions, treatment of\nsecondary factors, and avoidance of\nmedications that might raise triglycer-\nides are recommended.\nThe Reduction of Cardiovascular Events\nwith Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial\n(REDUCE-IT) enrolled 8,179 adults receiv-\ning statin therapy with moderately el-\nevated triglycerides (135\u2013499 mg/dL,\nmedian baseline of 216 mg/dL) who had\neither established cardiovascular disease\n(secondary prevention cohort) or diabetes\nplus at least one other cardiovascular risk\nfactor (primary prevention cohort) (121).\nPatients were randomized to icosapent\nethyl 4 g/day (2 g twice daily with food)\nversus placebo. The trial met its primary\nend point, demonstrating a 25% relative\nrisk reduction (P < 0.001) for the primary\nend point composite of cardiovascular\ndeath, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coro-\nnary revascularization, or unstable angina.\nThis reduction in risk was seen in people\nwith or without diabetes at baseline. The\ncomposite of cardiovascular death, nonfa-\ntal MI, or nonfatal stroke was reduced by\n26% (P < 0.001). Additional ischemic end\npoints were signi\ufb01cantly lower in the ico-\nsapent ethyl group than in the placebo\ngroup, including cardiovascular death,\nwhich was reduced by 20% (P = 0.03).\nThe proportions of patients experiencing\nadverse events and serious adverse\nevents were similar between the active\nand placebo treatment groups. It should\nbe noted that data are lacking with\nother n-3 fatty acids, and results of\nthe REDUCE-IT trial should not be ex-\ntrapolated to other products (121). As\nan example, the addition of 4 g per day\nof a carboxylic acid formulation of the\nn-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid\n(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\n(n-3 carboxylic acid) to statin therapy\nin patients with atherogenic dyslipide-\nmia and high cardiovascular risk, 70%\nof whom had diabetes, did not reduce\nthe risk of major adverse cardiovascular\nevents compared with the inert com-\nparator of corn oil (122).\nLow levels of HDL cholesterol, often as-\nsociated with elevated triglyceride levels,\nare the most prevalent pattern of dyslipi-\ndemia in people with type 2 diabetes.\nHowever, the evidence for the use of\ndrugs that target these lipid fractions\nis substantially less robust than that\nfor statin therapy (123).

A\nStatin and Fibrate Combination Therapy\nCombination therapy (statin and \ufb01brate)\nis associated with an increased risk for\nabnormal transaminase levels, myositis,\nand rhabdomyolysis. The risk of rhabdo-\nmyolysis is more common with higher\ndoses of statins and renal insuf\ufb01ciency\nand appears to be higher when statins\nare combined with gem\ufb01brozil (com-\npared with feno\ufb01brate) (125).\nIn the ACCORD study, in people with\ntype 2 diabetes who were at high risk\nfor ASCVD, the combination of feno\ufb01-\nbrate and simvastatin did not reduce the\nrate of fatal cardiovascular events, non-\nfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke compared\nwith simvastatin alone. Prespeci\ufb01ed sub-\ngroup analyses suggested heterogeneity\nin treatment effects with possible bene-\n\ufb01t for men with both a triglyceride level\n$204 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L) and an HDL\ncholesterol level #34 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L)\n(126).\nStatin and Niacin Combination Therapy\nThe Atherothrombosis Intervention in\nMetabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High\nTriglycerides: Impact on Global Health Out-\ncomes (AIM-HIGH) trial randomized over\n3,000 people (about one-third with diabe-\ntes) with established ASCVD, LDL choles-\nterol levels <180 mg/dL [4.7 mmol/L], low\nHDL cholesterol levels (men <40 mg/dL\n[1.0 mmol/L] and women <50 mg/dL\n[1.3 mmol/L]), and triglyceride levels of\n150\u2013400 mg/dL (1.7\u20134.5 mmol/L) to\nstatin therapy plus extended-release nia-\ncin or placebo. The trial was halted early\ndue to lack of ef\ufb01cacy on the primary\nASCVD outcome (\ufb01rst event of the com-\nposite of death from CHD, nonfatal MI, is-\nchemic stroke, hospitalization for an ACS,\nor symptom-driven coronary or cerebral\nrevascularization) and a possible increase\nin ischemic stroke in those on combina-\ntion therapy (127).\nThe much larger Heart Protection\nStudy 2\u2013Treatment of HDL to Reduce\nthe Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-\nTHRIVE) trial also failed to show a bene-\n\ufb01t of adding niacin to background statin\ntherapy (128). A total of 25,673 individ-\nuals with prior vascular disease were\nrandomized to receive 2 g of extended-\nrelease niacin and 40 mg of laropiprant\n(an antagonist of the prostaglandin D2\nreceptor DP1 that has been shown to\nimprove participation in niacin therapy)\nversus a matching placebo daily and fol-\nlowed for a median follow-up period of\n3.9 years. There was no signi\ufb01cant dif-\nference in the rate of coronary death,\nMI, stroke, or coronary revascularization\nwith the addition of niacin\u2013laropiprant\nversus placebo (13.2% vs. 13.7%; rate\nratio 0.96; P = 0.29). Niacin\u2013laropi-\nprant was associated with an increased\nincidence of new-onset diabetes (abso-\nlute excess, 1.3 percentage points; P <\n0.001) and disturbances in diabetes\nmanagement among those with diabe-\ntes. In addition, there was an increase in\nserious adverse events associated with\nthe gastrointestinal system, musculoskele-\ntal system, skin, and, unexpectedly, in-\nfection and bleeding.\nTherefore, combination therapy with a\nstatin and niacin is not recommended\ngiven the lack of ef\ufb01cacy on major ASCVD\noutcomes and increased side effects.\nDiabetes Risk With Statin Use\nSeveral studies have reported a mod-\nestly increased risk of incident diabetes\nwith statin use (129,130), which may be\nlimited to those with diabetes risk fac-\ntors. An analysis of one of the initial\nstudies suggested that although statin\nuse was associated with diabetes risk,\nthe cardiovascular event rate reduction\nwith statins far outweighed the risk of\nincident diabetes even for patients at\nhighest risk for diabetes (131). The ab-\nsolute risk increase was small (over\n5 years of follow-up, 1.2% of participants\non placebo developed diabetes and 1.5%\non rosuvastatin developed diabetes) (131).\nA meta-analysis of 13 randomized statin\ntrials with 91,140 participants showed an\nodds ratio of 1.09 for a new diagnosis of\ndiabetes, so that (on average) treatment\nof 255 patients with statins for 4 years re-\nsulted in one additional case of diabetes\nwhile simultaneously preventing 5.4 vascu-\nlar events among those 255 patients (130).\nLipid-Lowering Agents and Cognitive\nFunction\nAlthough concerns regarding a potential\nadverse impact of lipid-lowering agents\non cognitive function have been raised,\nseveral lines of evidence point against\nthis association, as detailed in a 2018\nEuropean Atherosclerosis Society Consensus\nPanel statement (132). First, there are three\nlarge randomized trials of statin versus pla-\ncebo where speci\ufb01c cognitive tests were\nperformed, and no differences were seen\nbetween statin and placebo (133\u2013136). In\naddition, no change in cognitive function\nhas been reported in studies with the addi-\ntion of ezetimibe (105) or PCSK9 inhibitors\n(108,137) to statin therapy, including\namong patients treated to very low\nLDL cholesterol levels. In addition, the\nmost recent systematic review of the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s\n(FDA\u2019s) postmarketing surveillance data-\nbases, randomized controlled trials, and\ncohort, case-control, and cross-sectional\nstudies evaluating cognition in patients\nreceiving statins found that published\ndata do not reveal an adverse effect of\nstatins on cognition (138). Therefore, a\nconcern that statins or other lipid-lowering\nagents might cause cognitive dysfunction\nor dementia is not currently supported\nby evidence and should not deter their\nuse in individuals with diabetes at high\nrisk for ASCVD (138).\nANTIPLATELET AGENTS\nRecommendations\n10.33 Use aspirin therapy (75\u2013162\nmg/day) as a secondary pre-\nvention strategy in those with\ndiabetes and a history of\natherosclerotic cardiovascular\ndisease.

A\n10.38 Aspirin therapy (75\u2013162 mg/day)\nmay be considered as a primary\nprevention strategy in those\nwith diabetes who are at in-\ncreased cardiovascular risk, af-\nter a comprehensive discussion\nwith the patient on the bene-\n\ufb01ts versus the comparable in-\ncreased risk of bleeding. A\nRisk Reduction\nAspirin has been shown to be effective\nin reducing cardiovascular morbidity and\nmortality in high-risk patients with previ-\nous MI or stroke (secondary prevention)\nand is strongly recommended. In pri-\nmary prevention, however, among pa-\ntients with no previous cardiovascular\nevents, its net bene\ufb01t is more contro-\nversial (129,140).\nPrevious randomized controlled trials\nof aspirin speci\ufb01cally in people with dia-\nbetes failed to consistently show a signi\ufb01-\ncant reduction in overall ASCVD end\npoints, raising questions about the ef\ufb01-\ncacy of aspirin for primary prevention in\npeople with diabetes, although some sex\ndifferences were suggested (141\u2013143).\nThe Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collabo-\nration published an individual patient\u2013\nlevel meta-analysis (139) of the six large\ntrials of aspirin for primary prevention\nin the general population. These trials\ncollectively enrolled over 95,000 partici-\npants, including almost 4,000 with dia-\nbetes. Overall, they found that aspirin\nreduced the risk of serious vascular\nevents by 12% (relative risk 0.88 [95%\nCI 0.82\u20130.94]). The largest reduction\nwas for nonfatal MI, with little effect on\nCHD death (relative risk 0.95 [95% CI\n0.78\u20131.15]) or total stroke.\nMost recently, the ASCEND (A Study\nof Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes)\ntrial randomized 15,480 people with di-\nabetes but no evident cardiovascular\ndisease to aspirin 100 mg daily or pla-\ncebo (144). The primary ef\ufb01cacy end\npoint was vascular death, MI, or stroke\nor transient ischemic attack. The primary\nsafety outcome was major bleeding (i.e.,\nintracranial hemorrhage, sight-threatening\nbleeding in the eye, gastrointestinal\nbleeding, or other serious bleeding).\nDuring a mean follow-up of 7.4 years,\nthere was a signi\ufb01cant 12% reduction\nin the primary ef\ufb01cacy end point (8.5%\nvs. 9.6%; P = 0.01). In contrast, major\nbleeding was signi\ufb01cantly increased from\n3.2 to 4.1% in the aspirin group (rate ra-\ntio 1.29; P = 0.003), with most of the ex-\ncess being gastrointestinal bleeding and\nother extracranial bleeding. There were\nno signi\ufb01cant differences by sex, weight,\nor duration of diabetes or other baseline\nfactors including ASCVD risk score.\nTwo other large, randomized trials of\naspirin for primary prevention, in people\nwithout diabetes (ARRIVE [Aspirin to Re-\nduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events])\n(145) and in the elderly (ASPREE [Aspirin\nin Reducing Events in the Elderly]) (146),\nwhich included 11% with diabetes, found\nno bene\ufb01t of aspirin on the primary ef\ufb01-\ncacy end point and an increased risk of\nbleeding. In ARRIVE, with 12,546 patients\nover a period of 60 months follow-up,\nthe primary end point occurred in 4.29%\nvs. 4.48% of patients in the aspirin ver-\nsus placebo groups (HR 0.96 [95% CI\n0.81\u20131.13]; P = 0.60). Gastrointestinal\nbleeding events (characterized as mild)\noccurred in 0.97% of patients in the aspi-\nrin group vs. 0.46% in the placebo group\n(HR\n2.11\n[95%\nCI\n1.36\u20133.28];\nP\n=\n0.0007). In ASPREE, including 19,114 in-\ndividuals, for cardiovascular disease (fatal\nCHD, MI, stroke, or hospitalization for\nheart failure) after a median of 4.7 years\nof follow-up, the rates per 1,000 person-\nyears were 10.7 vs. 11.3 events in aspirin\nvs. placebo groups (HR 0.95 [95% CI\n0.83\u20131.08]). The rate of major hemor-\nrhage per 1,000 person-years was 8.6\nevents vs. 6.2 events, respectively (HR\n1.38 [95% CI 1.18\u20131.62]; P < 0.001).\nThus, aspirin appears to have a modest\neffect on ischemic vascular events, with\nthe absolute decrease in events depending\non the underlying ASCVD risk.The main ad-\nverse effect is an increased risk of gastroin-\ntestinal bleeding. The excess risk may be as\nhigh as 5 per 1,000 per year in real-world\nsettings. However, for adults with ASCVD\nrisk >1% per year, the number of ASCVD\nevents prevented will be similar to the\nnumber of episodes of bleeding induced,\nalthough these complications do not have\nequal effects on long-term health (147).\nRecommendations for using aspirin as\nprimary prevention include both men and\nwomen aged $50 years with diabetes\nand at least one additional major risk\nfactor\n(family\nhistory\nof\npremature\nASCVD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smok-\ning, or CKD/albuminuria) who are not at\nincreased risk of bleeding (e.g., older age,\nanemia, renal disease) (148\u2013151). Nonin-\nvasive imaging techniques such as coro-\nnary calcium scoring may potentially help\nfurther tailor aspirin therapy, particularly\nin those at low risk (152,153). For people\n>70 years of age (with or without diabe-\ntes), the balance appears to have greater\nrisk than bene\ufb01t (144,146). Thus, for pri-\nmary prevention, the use of aspirin needs\nto be carefully considered and may gener-\nally not be recommended. Aspirin may\nbe considered in the context of high car-\ndiovascular risk with low bleeding risk,\nbut generally not in older adults. Aspirin\ntherapy for primary prevention may be\nconsidered in the context of shared deci-\nsion-making, which carefully weighs the\ncardiovascular bene\ufb01ts with the fairly\ncomparable increase in risk of bleeding.\nFor people with documented ASCVD,\nuse of aspirin for secondary prevention has\nfar greater bene\ufb01t than risk; for this indica-\ntion, aspirin is still recommended (139).\nAspirin Use in People <50 Years of\nAge\nAspirin is not recommended for those\nat low risk of ASCVD (such as men and\nwomen aged <50 years with diabetes\nwith no other major ASCVD risk factors)\nas the low bene\ufb01t is likely to be out-\nweighed by the risks of bleeding. Clini-\ncal judgment should be used for those\nat intermediate risk (younger patients\nwith one or more risk factors or older\npatients with no risk factors) until fur-\nther research is available. Patients\u2019 will-\ningness to undergo long-term aspirin\ntherapy should also be considered (154).\nAspirin use in patients aged <21 years is\ngenerally contraindicated due to the asso-\nciated risk of Reye syndrome.\nAspirin Dosing\nAverage daily dosages used in most clin-\nical trials involving people with diabetes\nranged from 50 mg to 650 mg but were\nmostly in the range of 100\u2013325 mg/day.\nThere is little evidence to support any\nspeci\ufb01c dose but using the lowest possi-\nble dose may help to reduce side ef-\nfects (155).

    "text": "diabetes, there were no signi\ufb01cant dif-\nferences in cardiovascular events or ma-\njor bleeding between patients assigned\nto 81 mg and those assigned to 325 mg\nof aspirin daily (156). In the U.S., the\nmost common low-dose tablet is 81 mg.\nAlthough platelets from people with di-\nabetes have altered function, it is un-\nclear what, if any, effect that \ufb01nding has\non the required dose of aspirin for car-\ndioprotective effects in people with dia-\nbetes. Many alternate pathways for\nplatelet activation exist that are inde-\npendent of thromboxane A2 and thus are\nnot sensitive to the effects of aspirin (157).\n\u201cAspirin resistance\u201d has been described in\npeople with diabetes when measured by a\nvariety of ex vivo and in vitro methods\n(platelet aggregometry, measurement of\nthromboxane B2) (158), but other studies\nsuggest no impairment in aspirin response\namong people with diabetes (159). A trial\nsuggested that more frequent dosing regi-\nmens of aspirin may reduce platelet reac-\ntivity in individuals with diabetes (160);\nhowever, these observations alone are in-\nsuf\ufb01cient to empirically recommend that\nhigher doses of aspirin be used in this\ngroup at this time. Another meta-analysis\nraised the hypothesis that low-dose aspi-\nrin ef\ufb01cacy is reduced in those weighing\n>70 kg (161); however, the ASCEND trial\nfound bene\ufb01t of low-dose aspirin in those\nin this weight range, which would thus\nnot validate this suggested hypothesis\n(144). It appears that 75\u2013162 mg/day is\noptimal.\nIndications for P2Y12 Receptor\nAntagonist Use\nA P2Y12 receptor antagonist in combina-\ntion with aspirin is reasonable for at least\n1 year in patients following an ACS and\nmay have bene\ufb01ts beyond this period. Ev-\nidence supports use of either ticagrelor or\nclopidogrel if no percutaneous coronary\nintervention was performed and clopidog-\nrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel if a percutane-\nous coronary intervention was performed\n(162). In people with diabetes and prior\nMI (1\u20133 years before), adding ticagrelor\nto aspirin signi\ufb01cantly reduces the risk of\nrecurrent ischemic events including car-\ndiovascular and CHD death (163). Simi-\nlarly, the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin\nreduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascu-\nlar events compared with aspirin alone in\npeople with diabetes and stable coronary\nartery disease (164,165). However, a\nhigher incidence of major bleeding,\nincluding intracranial hemorrhage, was\nnoted with dual antiplatelet therapy.\nThe net clinical bene\ufb01t (ischemic bene\ufb01t\nvs. bleeding risk) was improved with ti-\ncagrelor therapy in the large prespeci-\n\ufb01ed subgroup of patients with history\nof percutaneous coronary intervention,\nwhile no net bene\ufb01t was seen in pa-\ntients without prior percutaneous coro-\nnary intervention (165). However, early\naspirin discontinuation compared with\ncontinued dual antiplatelet therapy af-\nter coronary stenting may reduce the\nrisk of bleeding without a corresponding\nincrease in the risks of mortality and is-\nchemic events, as shown in a prespeci-\n\ufb01ed analysis of people with diabetes\nenrolled in the TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With\nAspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients Af-\nter Coronary Intervention) trial and a re-\ncent meta-analysis (166,167).\nCombination Antiplatelet and\nAnticoagulation Therapy\nCombination therapy with aspirin plus\nlow dose rivaroxaban may be consid-\nered for people with stable coronary\nand/or peripheral artery disease to pre-\nvent major adverse limb and cardiovas-\ncular complications. In the COMPASS\n(Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Us-\ning Anticoagulation Strategies) trial of\n27,395 individuals with established coro-\nnary artery disease and/or peripheral\nartery disease, aspirin plus rivaroxaban\n2.5 mg twice daily was superior to aspirin\nplus placebo in the reduction of cardio-\nvascular ischemic events including major\nadverse limb events. The absolute bene-\n\ufb01ts of combination therapy appeared\nlarger in people with diabetes, who\ncomprised 10,341 of the trial partici-\npants (168,169). A similar treatment\nstrategy was evaluated in the Vascular\nOutcomes Study of ASA (acetylsalicylic\nacid) Along with Rivaroxaban in Endovas-\ncular or Surgical Limb Revascularization\nfor Peripheral Artery Disease (VOYAGER\nPAD) trial (170), in which 6,564 individu-\nals with peripheral artery disease who\nhad undergone revascularization were ran-\ndomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban\n2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin or placebo\nplus aspirin. Rivaroxaban treatment in\nthis group of patients was also associ-\nated with a signi\ufb01cantly lower incidence of\nischemic cardiovascular events, including\nmajor adverse limb events. However, an in-\ncreased risk of major bleeding was noted\nwith rivaroxaban added to aspirin treatment\nin both COMPASS and VOYAGER PAD.\nThe risks and bene\ufb01ts of dual antiplate-\nlet or antiplatelet plus anticoagulant treat-\nment strategies should be thoroughly\ndiscussed with eligible patients, and\nshared decision-making should be used\nto determine an individually appropriate\ntreatment approach. This \ufb01eld of cardio-\nvascular risk reduction is evolving rapidly,\nas are the de\ufb01nitions of optimal care for\npatients with differing types and circum-\nstances of cardiovascular complications.\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nScreening\nRecommendations\n10.39 In asymptomatic individuals,\nroutine screening for coro-\nnary artery disease is not rec-\nommended as it does not\nimprove outcomes as long as\natherosclerotic cardiovascu-\nlar disease risk factors are\ntreated. A\n10.40 Consider investigations for cor-\nonary artery disease in the\npresence of any of the follow-\ning: atypical cardiac symptoms\n(e.g., unexplained dyspnea,\nchest discomfort); signs or\nsymptoms of associated vas-\ncular disease including carotid\nbruits, transient ischemic at-\ntack, stroke, claudication, or\nperipheral arterial disease; or\nelectrocardiogram abnormali-\nties (e.g., Q waves). E\nTreatment\nRecommendations\n10.41\nAmong people with type 2\ndiabetes who have estab-\nlished atherosclerotic cardio-\nvascular disease or established\nkidney disease, a sodium\u2013\nglucose cotransporter 2 in-\nhibitor or glucagon-like pep-\ntide 1 receptor agonist with\ndemonstrated cardiovascular\ndisease bene\ufb01t (Table 10.3B\nand Table 10.3C) is recom-\nmended as part of the com-\nprehensive\ncardiovascular\nrisk reduction and/or glucose-\nlowering regimens.

In pro-\nspective studies, coronary artery calcium\nhas been established as an independent\npredictor of future ASCVD events in peo-\nple with diabetes and is consistently supe-\nrior to both the UK Prospective Diabetes\nStudy (UKPDS) risk engine and the Fra-\nmingham Risk Score in predicting risk in\nthis population (175\u2013177). However, a\nrandomized observational trial demon-\nstrated no clinical bene\ufb01t to routine\nscreening of asymptomatic people with\ntype 2 diabetes and normal ECGs (178).\nDespite abnormal myocardial perfusion\nimaging in more than one in \ufb01ve pa-\ntients, cardiac outcomes were essentially\nequal (and very low) in screened versus\nunscreened patients. Accordingly, indis-\ncriminate screening is not considered\ncost-effective. Studies have found that a\nrisk factor-based approach to the initial\ndiagnostic evaluation and subsequent\nfollow-up for coronary artery disease\nfails to identify which people with type 2\ndiabetes will have silent ischemia on\nscreening tests (179,180).\nAny bene\ufb01t of newer noninvasive coro-\nnary artery disease screening methods,\nsuch as computed tomography calcium\nscoring and computed tomography angi-\nography, to identify patient subgroups for\ndifferent treatment strategies remains un-\nproven in asymptomatic people with dia-\nbetes, though research is ongoing. Since\nasymptomatic people with diabetes with\nhigher coronary disease burden have\nmore future cardiac events (175,181,182),\nthese additional imaging tests may pro-\nvide reasoning for treatment intensi\ufb01-\ncation and/or guide informed patient\ndecision-making and willingness for\nmedication initiation and participation.\nWhile coronary artery screening meth-\nods, such as calcium scoring, may improve\ncardiovascular risk assessment in people\nwith type 2 diabetes (183), their routine\nuse leads to radiation exposure and may\nresult in unnecessary invasive testing such\nas coronary angiography and revasculariza-\ntion procedures. The ultimate balance of\nbene\ufb01t, cost, and risks of such an ap-\nproach in asymptomatic patients re-\nmains controversial, particularly in the\nmodern setting of aggressive ASCVD\nrisk factor control.\nLifestyle and Pharmacologic\nInterventions\nIntensive lifestyle intervention focusing\non weight loss through decreased calo-\nric intake and increased physical activity\nas performed in the Action for Health in\nDiabetes (Look AHEAD) trial may be\nconsidered for improving glucose con-\ntrol, \ufb01tness, and some ASCVD risk fac-\ntors (184). Patients at increased ASCVD\nrisk should receive statin, ACE inhibitor,\nor ARB therapy if the patient has hyper-\ntension, and possibly aspirin, unless there\nare contraindications to a particular drug\nclass. Clear bene\ufb01t exists for ACE inhibitor\nor ARB therapy in people with diabetic\nkidney disease or hypertension, and these\nagents are recommended for hypertension\nmanagement in people with known\nASCVD (particularly coronary artery dis-\nease) (65,66,185). People with type 2\ndiabetes and CKD should be considered\nfor treatment with \ufb01nerenone to reduce\ncardiovascular outcomes and the risk of\nCKD progression (186\u2013189). b-Blockers\nshould be used in individuals with active\nangina or HFrEF and for 3 years after Ml\nin those with preserved left ventricular\nfunction (190,191).\nGlucose-Lowering Therapies and\nCardiovascular Outcomes\nIn 2008, the FDA issued a guidance for\nindustry to perform cardiovascular out-\ncomes trials for all new medications for\nthe treatment for type 2 diabetes amid\nconcerns of increased cardiovascular\nrisk (192). Previously approved diabetes\nmedications were not subject to the\nguidance. Recently published cardiovas-\ncular outcomes trials have provided addi-\ntional data on cardiovascular and renal\noutcomes in people with type 2 diabetes\nwith cardiovascular disease or at high\nrisk for cardiovascular disease (Table\n10.3A, Table 10.3B, and Table 10.3C).\nAn expanded review of the effects of\nglucose-lowering and other therapies\nS176\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

In addition,\nthe CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome\nStudy of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in\nType 2 Diabetes) study demonstrated\nnoninferiority between a DPP-4 inhibitor,\nlinagliptin, and a sulfonylurea, glimepir-\nide, on cardiovascular outcomes despite\nlower rates of hypoglycemia in the lina-\ngliptin treatment group (193). However,\nresults from other new agents have pro-\nvided a mix of results.\nSGLT2 Inhibitor Trials\nThe Bl 10773 (Empagli\ufb02ozin) Cardio-\nvascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2\nDiabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG\nOUTCOME) was a randomized, double-\nblind trial that assessed the effect of\nempagli\ufb02ozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, versus\nplacebo on cardiovascular outcomes in\n7,020 people with type 2 diabetes and ex-\nisting cardiovascular disease. Study partic-\nipants had a mean age of 63 years, 57%\nhad diabetes for more than 10 years, and\n99% had established cardiovascular dis-\nease. EMPA-REG OUTCOME showed that\nover a median follow-up of 3.1 years,\ntreatment reduced the composite out-\ncome of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular\ndeath by 14% (absolute rate 10.5% vs.\n12.1% in the placebo group, HR in the em-\npagli\ufb02ozin group 0.86 [95% CI 0.74\u20130.99];\nP = 0.04 for superiority) and cardiovascular\ndeath by 38% (absolute rate 3.7% vs.\n5.9%, HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49\u20130.77]; P <\n0.001) (8).\nTwo large outcomes trials of the SGLT2\ninhibitor canagli\ufb02ozin have been con-\nducted that separately assessed 1) the\ncardiovascular effects of treatment in pa-\ntients at high risk for major adverse car-\ndiovascular events (9) and 2) the impact\nof canagli\ufb02ozin therapy on cardiorenal\noutcomes in people with diabetes-related\nCKD (194). First, the Canagli\ufb02ozin Cardio-\nvascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Pro-\ngram integrated data from two trials. The\nCANVAS trial that started in 2009 was\npartially unblinded prior to completion\nbecause of the need to \ufb01le interim car-\ndiovascular outcomes data for regulatory\napproval of the drug (195). Thereafter, the\npost approval CANVAS-Renal (CANVAS-R)\ntrial was started in 2014. Combining both\ntrials, 10,142 participants with type 2 dia-\nbetes were randomized to canagli\ufb02ozin or\nplacebo and were followed for an average\n3.6 years. The mean age of patients was\n63 years, and 66% had a history of cardio-\nvascular disease. The combined analysis of\nthe two trials found that canagli\ufb02ozin sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduced the composite outcome\nof cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke ver-\nsus placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 par-\nticipants per 1,000 patient-years; HR 0.86\n[95% CI 0.75\u20130.97]). The speci\ufb01c estimates\nfor canagli\ufb02ozin versus placebo on the pri-\nmary composite cardiovascular outcome\nwere HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.75\u20131.03) for the\nCANVAS trial and 0.82 (0.66\u20131.01) for\nCANVAS-R, with no heterogeneity found\nbetween trials. Of note, there was an in-\ncreased risk of lower-limb amputation\nwith canagli\ufb02ozin (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants\nper 1,000 patient-years; HR 1.97 [95% CI\n1.41\u20132.75]) (9). Second, the Canagli\ufb02ozin\nand Renal Events in Diabetes with Es-\ntablished Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation\n(CREDENCE) trial randomized 4,401 people\nwith type 2 diabetes and chronic diabetes-\nrelated kidney disease (UACR >300 mg/g\nand eGFR 30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) to\ncanagli\ufb02ozin 100 mg daily or placebo\n(194). The primary outcome was a com-\nposite of end-stage kidney disease, dou-\nbling of serum creatinine, or death from\nrenal or cardiovascular causes. The trial\nwas stopped early due to conclusive\nevidence of ef\ufb01cacy identi\ufb01ed during a\nprespeci\ufb01ed interim analysis with no\nunexpected safety signals. The risk of\nthe primary composite outcome was\n30% lower with canagli\ufb02ozin treatment\nwhen compared with placebo (HR 0.70\n[95% CI 0.59\u20130.82]). Moreover, it re-\nduced the prespeci\ufb01ed end point of\nend-stage kidney disease alone by 32%\n(HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.54\u20130.86]). Canagli\ufb02o-\nzin was additionally found to have a\nlower risk of the composite of cardio-\nvascular death, MI, or stroke (HR 0.80\n[95% CI 0.67\u20130.95]), as well as lower\nrisk of hospitalizations for heart failure\n(HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.47\u20130.80]) and of the\ncomposite of cardiovascular death or\nhospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.69\n[95% CI 0.57\u20130.83]). In terms of safety,\nno signi\ufb01cant increase in lower-limb am-\nputations, fractures, acute kidney injury,\nor hyperkalemia was noted for canagli-\n\ufb02ozin relative to placebo in CREDENCE.\nAn increased risk for diabetic ketoacido-\nsis was noted, however, with 2.2 and\n0.2 events per 1,000 patient-years noted\nin the canagli\ufb02ozin and placebo groups, re-\nspectively (HR 10.80 [95% CI 1.39\u201383.65])\n(194).\nThe Dapagli\ufb02ozin Effect on Cardiovas-\ncular Events-Thrombosis in Myocardial In-\nfarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial was\nanother randomized, double-blind trial\nthat assessed the effects of dapagli\ufb02ozin\nversus placebo on cardiovascular and\nrenal outcomes in 17,160 people with\ntype 2 diabetes and established ASCVD\nor multiple risk factors for ASCVD (196).\nStudy participants had a mean age of\n64 years, with \u000140% of study partici-\npants having established ASCVD at\nbaseline\u2014a characteristic of this trial\nthat differs from other large cardiovascu-\nlar trials where a majority of participants\nhad established cardiovascular disease.\nDECLARE-TIMI 58 met the prespeci\ufb01ed\ncriteria for noninferiority to placebo\nwith respect to major adverse cardio-\nvascular events but did not show a\nlower rate of major adverse cardiovas-\ncular events when compared with pla-\ncebo (8.8% in the dapagli\ufb02ozin group\nand 9.4% in the placebo group; HR 0.93\n[95% CI 0.84\u20131.03]; P = 0.17). A lower\nrate of cardiovascular death or hospitali-\nzation for heart failure was noted (4.9%\nvs. 5.8%; HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73\u20130.95];\nP = 0.005), which re\ufb02ected a lower rate\nof hospitalization for heart failure (HR\n0.73 [95% CI 0.61\u20130.88]). No difference\nwas seen in cardiovascular death be-\ntween groups.\nIn the Dapagli\ufb02ozin and Prevention of\nAdverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Dis-\nease (DAPA-CKD) trial (197), 4,304 indi-\nviduals with CKD (UACR 200\u20135,000 mg/g\nand eGFR 25\u201375 mL/min/1.73 m2), with\nor without diabetes, were randomized\nto dapagli\ufb02ozin 10 mg daily or placebo.\nThe primary outcome was a composite\nof sustained decline in eGFR of at least\n50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death\nfrom renal or cardiovascular causes. Over\na median follow-up period of 2.4 years, a\nprimary outcome event occurred in 9.2%\nof participants in the dapagli\ufb02ozin group\nand 14.5% of those in the placebo group.\nThe risk of the primary composite out-\ncome was signi\ufb01cantly lower with dapa-\ngli\ufb02ozin therapy compared with placebo\n(HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.51\u20130.72]), as were the\nrisks for a renal composite outcome of\nsustained decline in eGFR of at least 50%,\nendstage kidney disease, or death from\nrenal causes (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.45\u20130.68]),\nand a composite of cardiovascular death\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nS177\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Study participants had a mean\nage of 64.4 years and a mean duration\nof diabetes of 13 years at baseline and\nwere followed for a median of 3.0 years.\nVERTIS CV met the prespeci\ufb01ed criteria\nfor noninferiority of ertugli\ufb02ozin to pla-\ncebo with respect to the primary out-\ncome of major adverse cardiovascular\nevents (11.9% in the pooled ertugli\ufb02ozin\ngroup and 11.9% in the placebo group;\nHR 0.97 [95% CI 0.85\u20131.11]; P < 0.001).\nErtugli\ufb02ozin was not superior to placebo\nfor the key secondary outcomes of death\nfrom cardiovascular causes or hospitali-\nzation for heart failure; death from car-\ndiovascular causes; or the composite of\ndeath from renal causes, renal replace-\nment therapy, or doubling of the serum\ncreatinine level. The HR for a secondary\noutcome of hospitalization for heart fail-\nure (ertugli\ufb02ozin vs. placebo) was 0.70\n[95% CI 0.54\u20130.90], consistent with \ufb01nd-\nings from other SGLT2 inhibitor cardio-\nvascular outcomes trials.\nSotagli\ufb02ozin, an SGLT1 and SGLT2 in-\nhibitor not currently approved by the\nFDA in the U.S., lowers glucose via de-\nlayed glucose absorption in the gut in\naddition to increasing urinary glucose\nexcretion and has been evaluated in the\nEffect of Sotagli\ufb02ozin on Cardiovascular\nand Renal Events in Patients With\nType 2 Diabetes and Moderate Renal Im-\npairment Who Are at Cardiovascular Risk\n(SCORED) trial (202). A total of 10,584\npeople with type 2 diabetes, CKD, and ad-\nditional cardiovascular risk were enrolled\nin SCORED and randomized to sotagli\ufb02o-\nzin 200 mg once daily (uptitrated to\n400 mg once daily if tolerated) or pla-\ncebo. SCORED ended early due to a lack\nof funding; thus, changes to the prespe-\nci\ufb01ed primary end points were made\nprior to unblinding to accommodate a\nlower than anticipated number of end\npoint events. The primary end point of\nthe trial was the total number of deaths\nfrom cardiovascular causes, hospitaliza-\ntions for heart failure, and urgent visits for\nheart failure. After a median of 16 months\nof follow-up, the rate of primary end point\nevents was reduced with sotagli\ufb02ozin (5.6\nevents per 100 patient-years in the sota-\ngli\ufb02ozin group and 7.5 events per 100\npatient-years in the placebo group [HR\n0.74 (95% CI 0.63\u20130.88); P < 0.001]).\nSotagli\ufb02ozin also reduced the risk of the\nsecondary end point of total number of\nhospitalizations for heart failure and ur-\ngent visits for heart failure (3.5% in the\nsotagli\ufb02ozin group and 5.1% in the pla-\ncebo group; HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.55\u20130.82];\nP < 0.001) but not the secondary end\npoint of deaths from cardiovascular causes.\nNo signi\ufb01cant between-group differences\nwere found for the outcome of all-cause\nmortality or for a composite renal out-\ncome comprising the \ufb01rst occurrence of\nlong-term dialysis, renal transplantation,\nor a sustained reduction in eGFR. In gen-\neral, the adverse effects of sotagli\ufb02ozin\nwere similar to those seen with use of\nSGLT2 inhibitors, but they also included\nan increased rate of diarrhea potentially\nrelated to the inhibition of SGLT1.\nGLP-1 Receptor Agonist Trials\nThe Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabe-\ntes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome\nResults (LEADER) trial was a randomized,\ndouble-blind trial that assessed the effect\nof liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1\n(GLP-1) receptor agonist, versus placebo\non cardiovascular outcomes in 9,340\npeople with type 2 diabetes at high risk\nfor cardiovascular disease or with cardio-\nvascular disease (203). Study participants\nhad a mean age of 64 years and a mean\nduration of diabetes of nearly 13 years.\nOver 80% of study participants had estab-\nlished cardiovascular disease. After a\nmedian follow-up of 3.8 years, LEADER\nshowed that the primary composite out-\ncome (MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death)\noccurred in fewer participants in the\ntreatment group (13.0%) when com-\npared with the placebo group (14.9%)\n(HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.78\u20130.97]; P < 0.001\nfor noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superior-\nity). Deaths from cardiovascular causes\nwere signi\ufb01cantly reduced in the liraglu-\ntide group (4.7%) compared with the\nplacebo group (6.0%) (HR 0.78 [95% CI\n0.66\u20130.93]; P = 0.007) (203).\nResults from a moderate-sized trial of\nanother GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglu-\ntide, were consistent with the LEADER\ntrial (204). Semaglutide is a once-weekly\nGLP-1 receptor agonist approved by the\nFDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\nThe Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and\nOther Long-term Outcomes With Sema-\nglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes\n(SUSTAIN-6) was the initial randomized\ntrial powered to test noninferiority of\nsemaglutide for the purpose of regulatory\napproval (204). In this study, 3,297 people\nwith type 2 diabetes were randomized to\nreceive once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg\nor 1.0 mg) or placebo for 2 years. The pri-\nmary outcome (the \ufb01rst occurrence of\ncardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or\nnonfatal stroke) occurred in 108 patients\n(6.6%) in the semaglutide group vs.\n146 patients (8.9%) in the placebo group\n(HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.58\u20130.95]; P < 0.001).\nMore patients discontinued treatment in\nthe semaglutide group because of ad-\nverse events, mainly gastrointestinal. The\ncardiovascular effects of the oral formu-\nlation of semaglutide compared with pla-\ncebo have been assessed in Peptide\nInnovation for Early Diabetes Treatment\n(PIONEER) 6, a preapproval trial designed\nto rule out an unacceptable increase in\ncardiovascular risk (205). In this trial of\n3,183 people with type 2 diabetes and\nhigh cardiovascular risk followed for a\nmedian of 15.9 months, oral semaglutide\nwas noninferior to placebo for the pri-\nmary composite outcome of cardiovascu-\nlar death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke\n(HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.57\u20131.11]; P < 0.001\nS180\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The cardiovascu-\nlar effects of this formulation of sema-\nglutide will be further tested in a large,\nlonger-term outcomes trial.\nThe Harmony Outcomes trial random-\nized 9,463 people with type 2 diabetes\nand cardiovascular disease to once-weekly\nsubcutaneous albiglutide or matching pla-\ncebo, in addition to their standard care\n(206). Over a median duration of 1.6\nyears, the GLP-1 receptor agonist reduced\nthe risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or\nstroke to an incidence rate of 4.6 events\nper 100 person-years in the albiglutide\ngroup vs. 5.9 events in the placebo group\n(HR ratio 0.78, P = 0.0006 for superiority)\n(206). This agent is not currently available\nfor clinical use.\nThe Researching Cardiovascular Events\nWith a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes\n(REWIND) trial was a randomized,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled trial that\nassessed the effect of the once-weekly\nGLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide versus\nplacebo on major adverse cardiovascular\nevents in \u00019,990 people with type 2 dia-\nbetes at risk for cardiovascular events or\nwith a history of cardiovascular disease\n(207). Study participants had a mean age\nof 66 years and a mean duration of dia-\nbetes of \u000110 years. Approximately 32%\nof participants had history of atheroscle-\nrotic cardiovascular events at baseline. Af-\nter a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the\nprimary composite outcome of nonfatal\nMI, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardio-\nvascular causes occurred in 12.0% and\n13.4% of participants in the dulaglutide\nand placebo treatment groups, respec-\ntively (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.79\u20130.99]; P =\n0.026). These \ufb01ndings equated to inci-\ndence rates of 2.4 and 2.7 events per\n100 person-years, respectively. The re-\nsults were consistent across the sub-\ngroups of patients with and without\nhistory of CV events. Allcause mortality did\nnot differ between groups (P = 0.067).\nThe Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute\nCoronary Syndrome (ELIXA) trial studied\nthe once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist lixi-\nsenatide on cardiovascular outcomes in\npeople with type 2 diabetes who had had\na recent acute coronary event (208). A\ntotal of 6,068 people with type 2 diabe-\ntes with a recent hospitalization for MI\nor unstable angina within the previous\n180 days were randomized to receive\nlixisenatide or placebo in addition to\nstandard care and were followed for\na median of \u00012.1 years. The primary\noutcome of cardiovascular death, MI,\nstroke, or hospitalization for unstable\nangina occurred in 406 patients (13.4%)\nin the lixisenatide group vs. 399 (13.2%)\nin the placebo group (HR 1.2 [95% CI\n0.89\u20131.17]), which demonstrated the\nnoninferiority of lixisenatide to placebo\n(P < 0.001) but did not show superior-\nity (P = 0.81).\nThe Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular\nEvent Lowering (EXSCEL) trial also reported\nresults with the once-weekly GLP-1 recep-\ntor agonist extended-release exenatide\nand found that major adverse cardiovas-\ncular events were numerically lower\nwith use of extended-release exenatide\ncompared with placebo, although this\ndifference was not statistically signi\ufb01cant\n(209). A total of 14,752 people with type 2\ndiabetes (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] had\nprevious cardiovascular disease) were ran-\ndomized to receive extended-release exe-\nnatide 2 mg or placebo and followed for\na median of 3.2 years. The primary end\npoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or\nstroke occurred in 839 patients (11.4%;\n3.7 events per 100 person-years) in the\nexenatide group and in 905 patients\n(12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-years)\nin the placebo group (HR 0.91 [95% CI\n0.83\u20131.00]; P < 0.001 for noninferiority),\nbut exenatide was not superior to pla-\ncebo with respect to the primary end\npoint (P = 0.06 for superiority). However,\nall-cause mortality was lower in the exena-\ntide group (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.77\u20130.97]).\nThe incidence of acute pancreatitis, pancre-\natic cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma,\nand serious adverse events did not differ\nsigni\ufb01cantly between the two groups.\nIn summary, there are now numerous\nlarge randomized controlled trials re-\nporting statistically signi\ufb01cant reduc-\ntions in cardiovascular events for three\nof the FDA-approved SGLT2 inhibitors\n(empagli\ufb02ozin, canagli\ufb02ozin, dapagli\ufb02o-\nzin, with lesser bene\ufb01ts seen with ertu-\ngli\ufb02ozin) and four FDA-approved GLP-1\nreceptor agonists (liraglutide, albiglutide\n[although that agent was removed from\nthe market for business reasons], sema-\nglutide [lower risk of cardiovascular events\nin a moderate-sized clinical trial but one\nnot powered as a cardiovascular outcomes\ntrial], and dulaglutide). Meta-analyses of\nthe trials reported to date suggest that\nGLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibi-\ntors reduce risk of atherosclerotic major\nadverse cardiovascular events to a com-\nparable degree in people with type 2\ndiabetes and established ASCVD (210,211).\nSGLT2 inhibitors also reduce risk of heart\nfailure hospitalization and progression of\nkidney disease in people with established\nASCVD, multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or\nalbuminuric kidney disease (212,213). In\npeople with type 2 diabetes and estab-\nlished ASCVD, multiple ASCVD risk factors,\nor diabetic kidney disease, an SGLT2 inhibi-\ntor with demonstrated cardiovascular ben-\ne\ufb01t is recommended to reduce the risk of\nmajor adverse cardiovascular events and/\nor heart failure hospitalization. In people\nwith type 2 diabetes and established\nASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD,\na glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist\nwith demonstrated cardiovascular bene\ufb01t\nis recommended to reduce the risk of ma-\njor adverse cardiovascular events. For\nmany patients, use of either an SGLT2\ninhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist to\nreduce cardiovascular risk is appropri-\nate. Emerging data suggest that use of\nboth classes of drugs will provide an addi-\ntive cardiovascular and kidney outcomes\nbene\ufb01t; thus, combination therapy with\nan SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 receptor\nagonist may be considered to provide the\ncomplementary outcomes bene\ufb01ts asso-\nciated with these classes of medication.\nEvidence to support such an approach\nincludes \ufb01ndings from AMPLITUDE-O\n(Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovas-\ncular Outcomes), an outcomes trial of\npeople with type 2 diabetes and ei-\nther cardiovascular or kidney disease\nplus at least one other risk factor ran-\ndomized to the investigational GLP-1\nreceptor agonist efpeglenatide or pla-\ncebo (214). Randomization was strati\ufb01ed\nby current or potential use of SGLT2 inhib-\nitor therapy, a class ultimately used by\n>15% of the trial participants. Over a me-\ndian follow-up of 1.8 years, efpeglenatide\ntherapy reduced the risk of incident major\nadverse cardiovascular events by 27% and\nof a composite renal outcome event by\n32%. Importantly, the effects of efpeglena-\ntide did not vary by use of SGLT2 inhibi-\ntors, suggesting that the bene\ufb01cial effects\nof the GLP-1 receptor agonist were inde-\npendent of those provided by SGLT2\ninhibitor therapy (215).

Strategies to mitigate these\nrisks are needed, and the heart failure-\nrelated risks and bene\ufb01ts of glucose-\nlowering medications should be considered\ncarefully when determining a regimen of\ncare for people with diabetes and either\nestablished heart failure or high risk for\nthe development of heart failure.\nData on the effects of glucose-lowering\nagents on heart failure outcomes have\ndemonstrated\nthat\nthiazolidinediones\nhave a strong and consistent relation-\nship with increased risk of heart failure\n(218\u2013220). Therefore, thiazolidinedione\nuse should be avoided in people with\nsymptomatic heart failure. Restrictions\nto use of metformin in people with\nmedically treated heart failure were re-\nmoved by the FDA in 2006 (221). Obser-\nvational studies of people with type 2\ndiabetes and heart failure suggest that\nmetformin users have better outcomes\nthan individuals treated with other anti-\nhyperglycemic agents (222); however,\nno randomized trial of metformin ther-\napy has been conducted in people with\nheart failure. Metformin may be used\nfor the management of hyperglycemia\nin people with stable heart failure as\nlong as kidney function remains within\nthe recommended range for use (223).\nRecent studies examining the rela-\ntionship between DPP-4 inhibitors and\nheart failure have had mixed results.\nThe Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular\nOutcomes Recorded in Patients with Di-\nabetes Mellitus \u2013 Thrombolysis in Myo-\ncardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53)\nstudy showed that patients treated with\nthe DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin were\nmore likely to be hospitalized for heart\nfailure than those given placebo (3.5%\nvs. 2.8%, respectively) (224). However,\nthree other cardiovascular outcomes tri-\nals\u2014Examination of Cardiovascular Out-\ncomes with Alogliptin versus Standard\nof Care (EXAMINE) (225), Trial Evaluating\nCardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin\n(TECOS) (226), and the Cardiovascular and\nRenal Microvascular Outcome Study With\nLinagliptin (CARMELINA) (193)\u2014did not\n\ufb01nd a signi\ufb01cant increase in risk of heart\nfailure hospitalization with DPP-4 inhibitor\nuse compared with placebo. No increased\nrisk of heart failure hospitalization has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed in the cardiovascular\noutcomes trials of the GLP-1 receptor\nagonists lixisenatide, liraglutide, sema-\nglutide, exenatide once-weekly, albi-\nglutide, or dulaglutide compared with\nplacebo (Table 10.3B) (203,204,207\u2013209).\nReduced incidence of heart failure\nhas been observed with the use of\nSGLT2 inhibitors (8,194,196). In EMPA-\nREG OUTCOME, the addition of empagli-\n\ufb02ozin to standard care led to a signi\ufb01-\ncant 35% reduction in hospitalization for\nheart failure compared with placebo (8).\nAlthough the majority of patients in the\nstudy did not have heart failure at base-\nline, this bene\ufb01t was consistent in pa-\ntients with and without a history of\nheart failure (10). Similarly, in CANVAS\nand DECLARE-TIMI 58, there were 33%\nand 27% reductions in hospitalization for\nheart failure, respectively, with SGLT2 in-\nhibitor use versus placebo (9,196). Addi-\ntional data from the CREDENCE trial with\ncanagli\ufb02ozin showed a 39% reduction in\nhospitalization for heart failure, and 31%\nreduction in the composite of cardiovas-\ncular death or hospitalization for heart\nfailure, in a diabetic kidney disease popu-\nlation with albuminuria (UACR >300 to\n5,000 mg/g) (194).These combined \ufb01ndings\nfrom four large outcomes trials of three dif-\nferent SGLT2 inhibitors are highly consistent\nand clearly indicate robust bene\ufb01ts of\nSGLT2 inhibitors in the prevention of heart\nfailure hospitalizations. The EMPA-REG\nOUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58,\nand CREDENCE trials suggested, but did\nnot prove, that SGLT2 inhibitors would be\nbene\ufb01cial in the treatment of people with\nestablished heart failure. More recently,\nthe placebo-controlled DAPA-HF trial eval-\nuated the effects of dapagli\ufb02ozin on the\nprimary outcome of a composite of wors-\nening heart failure or cardiovascular death\nin patients with New York Heart Associa-\ntion (NYHA) class II, III, or IV heart failure\nand an ejection fraction of 40% or less. Of\nthe 4,744 trial participants, 45% had a his-\ntory of type 2 diabetes. Over a median of\n18.2 months, the group assigned to dapa-\ngli\ufb02ozin treatment had a lower risk of the\nprimary\noutcome\n(HR\n0.74\n[95%\nCI\n0.65\u20130.85]), lower risk of \ufb01rst worsening\nheart failure event (HR 0.70 [95% CI\n0.59\u20130.83]), and lower risk of cardiovascu-\nlar death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69\u20130.98])\ncompared with placebo. The effect of da-\npagli\ufb02ozin on the primary outcome was\nconsistent regardless of the presence or\nabsence of type 2 diabetes (11).\nEMPEROR-Reduced assessed the effects\nof empagli\ufb02ozin 10 mg once daily versus\nplacebo on a primary composite outcome\nof cardiovascular death or hospitalization\nfor worsening heart failure in a population\nof 3,730 patients with NYHA class II, III, or\nIV heart failure and an ejection fraction of\n40% or less (200). At baseline, 49.8% of\nparticipants had a history of diabetes.\nOver a median follow-up of 16 months,\nthose in the empagli\ufb02ozin-treated group\nhad a reduced risk of the primary outcome\n(HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.65\u20130.86]; P < 0.001)\nand fewer total hospitalizations for heart\nfailure (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.58\u20130.85]; P <\n0.001). The effect of empagli\ufb02ozin on the\nprimary outcome was consistent irrespec-\ntive of diabetes diagnosis at baseline. The\nrisk of a prespeci\ufb01ed renal composite out-\ncome (chronic dialysis, renal transplantation,\nor a sustained reduction in eGFR) was\nlower in the empagli\ufb02ozin group than in\nthe placebo group (1.6% in the empagli-\n\ufb02ozin group vs. 3.1% in the placebo\ngroup; HR 0.50 [95% CI 0.32\u20130.77]).\nEMPEROR-Preserved, a randomized\ndouble-blinded placebo-controlled trial of\n5,988 adults with NYHA functional class\nI\u2013IV chronic HFpEF (left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction >40%), evaluated the ef\ufb01-\ncacy of empagli\ufb02ozin 10 mg daily versus\nplacebo on top of standard of care on\nthe primary outcome of composite car-\ndiovascular death or hospitalization for\nheart failure (189). Approximately 50% of\nsubjects had type 2 diabetes at baseline.\nOver a median of 26.2 months, there was\na 21% reduction (HR 0.79 [95% CI\n0.69\u20130.90]; P < 0.001) of the primary\noutcome. The effects of empagli\ufb02ozin\nwere consistent in people with or with-\nout diabetes (189).\nIn the DELIVER trial, 6,263 individuals\nwith heart failure and an ejection frac-\ntion >40% were randomized to receive\neither dapagli\ufb02ozin or placebo (199). The\nprimary outcome of a composite of wors-\nening heart failure, de\ufb01ned as hospitaliza-\ntion or urgent visit for heart failure, or\ncardiovascular death was reduced by 18%\nin patients treated with dapagli\ufb02ozin com-\npared with placebo (HR 0.82 [95% CI\n0.73\u20130.92]; P < 0.001).

    "text": "Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-\nWHF) included 21,947 patients and dem-\nonstrated reduced risk for the composite\nof cardiovascular death or hospitalization\nfor heart failure, cardiovascular death, \ufb01rst\nhospitalization for heart failure, and all-\ncause mortality. The \ufb01ndings on the stud-\nied end points were consistent in both tri-\nals of heart failure with mildly reduced or\npreserved ejection fraction and in all \ufb01ve\ntrials combined. Collectively, these studies\nindicate that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the\nrisk for heart failure hospitalization and\ncardiovascular death in a wide range of\npeople with heart failure.\nAdditional data are accumulating regard-\ning the effects of SGLT inhibition in people\nhospitalized for acute decompensated heart\nfailure and in people with heart failure and\nHFpEF. As an example, the investigational\nSGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor sotagli\ufb02ozin\nhas also been studied in the SOLOIST-\nWHF trial (228). In SOLOIST-WHF, 1,222\npeople with type 2 diabetes who were re-\ncently hospitalized for worsening heart\nfailure were randomized to sotagli\ufb02ozin\n200 mg once daily (with uptitration to\n400 mg once daily if tolerated) or placebo\neither before or within 3 days after hospi-\ntal discharge. Patients were eligible if hos-\npitalized for signs and symptoms of heart\nfailure (including elevated natriuretic pep-\ntide levels) requiring treatment with intra-\nvenous diuretic therapy. Exclusion criteria\nincluded end-stage heart failure or recent\nacute coronary syndrome or intervention,\nor an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Pa-\ntients were required to be clinically stable\nprior to randomization, de\ufb01ned as no use\nof supplemental oxygen, a systolic blood\npressure $100 mmHg, and no need\nfor intravenous inotropic or vasodilator\ntherapy other than nitrates. Similar to\nSCORED, SOLOIST-WHF ended early due\nto a lack of funding, resulting in a\nchange to the prespeci\ufb01ed primary end\npoint prior to unblinding to accommo-\ndate a lower than anticipated number\nof end point events. At a median\nfollow-up of 9 months, the rate of\nprimary end point events (the total\nnumber of cardiovascular deaths and\nhospitalizations and urgent visits for\nheart failure) was lower in the sotagli-\n\ufb02ozin group than in the placebo group\n(51.0\nvs.\n76.3;\nHR\n0.67\n[95%\nCI\n0.52\u20130.85]; P < 0.001). No signi\ufb01cant\nbetween-group differences were found\nin the rates of cardiovascular death or\nall-cause mortality. Both diarrhea (6.1%\nvs.\n3.4%)\nand\nsevere\nhypoglycemia\n(1.5% vs. 0.3%) were more common\nwith sotagli\ufb02ozin than with placebo. The\ntrial was originally also intended to\nevaluate the effects of SGLT inhibition\nin people with HFpEF, and ultimately no\nevidence of heterogeneity of treatment\neffect by ejection fraction was noted.\nHowever, the relatively small percent-\nage of such patients enrolled (only 21%\nof participants had ejection fraction\n>50%) and the early termination of the\ntrial limited the ability to determine the\neffects of sotagli\ufb02ozin in HFpEF speci\ufb01cally.\nIn addition to the hospitalization and\nmortality bene\ufb01t in people with heart fail-\nure, several recent analyses have ad-\ndressed whether SGLT2 inhibitor treatment\nimproves clinical stability and functional\nstatus in individuals with heart failure. In\n3,730 patients with NYHA class II\u2013IV heart\nfailure with an ejection fraction of #40%,\ntreatment with empagli\ufb02ozin reduced the\ncombined risk of death, hospitalization for\nheart failure, or an emergent/urgent heart\nfailure visit requiring intravenous treatment\nand reduced the total number of hospital-\nizations for heart failure requiring intensive\ncare, a vasopressor or positive inotropic\ndrug, or mechanical or surgical intervention\n(229). In addition, patients treated with\nempagli\ufb02ozin were more likely to experi-\nence an improvement in NYHA functional\nclass (229). In people hospitalized for acute\nde novo or decompensated chronic heart\nfailure, initiation of empagli\ufb02ozin treatment\nduring hospitalization reduced the primary\noutcome of a composite of death from\nany cause, number of heart failure events\nand time to \ufb01rst heart failure event, or a\n5-point or greater difference in change\nfrom baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomy-\nopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score\n(230). Furthermore, PRESERVED-HF, a mul-\nticenter study (26 sites in the U.S.) showed\nthat dapagli\ufb02ozin treatment leads to signi\ufb01-\ncant improvement in both symptoms and\nphysical limitation, as well as objective\nmeasures of exercise function in people\nwith chronic HFpEF, regardless of diabetes\nstatus (198). Finally, canagli\ufb02ozin improved\nheart failure symptoms assessed using\nthe Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Ques-\ntionnaire Total Symptom Score, irrespec-\ntive of left ventricular ejection fraction or\nthe presence of diabetes (231). Therefore,\nin people with type 2 diabetes and estab-\nlished HFpEF or HFrEF, an SGLT2 inhibitor\nwith proven bene\ufb01t in this patient popu-\nlation is recommended to reduce the risk\nof worsening heart failure and cardiovas-\ncular death. In addition, an SGLT2 inhibitor\nis recommended in this patient population\nto improve symptoms, physical limitations,\nand quality of life. The bene\ufb01ts seen in\nthis patient population likely represent a\nclass effect, and they appear unrelated to\nglucose lowering given comparable out-\ncomes in people with heart failure with\nand without diabetes.\nFinerenone in People With Type 2 Diabetes\nand Chronic Kidney Disease\nAs discussed in detail in Section 11, \u201cChronic\nKidney Disease and Risk Management,\u201d peo-\nple with diabetes are at an increased risk\nfor CKD, which increases cardiovascular\nrisk (232). Finerenone, a selective non-\nsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist,\nhas been shown in the Finerenone in\nReducing Kidney Failure and Disease\nProgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease\n(FIDELIO-DKD) trial to improve CKD\noutcomes in people with type 2 diabetes\nwith stage 3 or 4 CKD and severe albumin-\nuria (233). In the Finerenone in Reducing\nCardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in\nDiabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial,\n7,437 patients with UACR 30\u2013300 mg/g\nand eGFR 25\u201390 mL/min/1.73 m2 or\nUACR 300\u20135,000 and eGFR $60 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 on maximum dose of renin-\nangiotensin system blockade were ran-\ndomized to receive \ufb01nerenone or placebo\n(186). The HR of the primary outcome of\ncardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal\nstroke, or hospitalization from heart failure\nwas reduced by 13% in patients treated\nwith \ufb01nerenone. A prespeci\ufb01ed subgroup\nanalysis from FIGARO-DKD further revealed\nthat in patients without symptomatic HFrEF,\n\ufb01nerenone reduces the risk for new-onset\nheart failure and improves heart failure\noutcomes in people with type 2 diabetes\nand CKD (187). Finally, in the pooled analy-\nsis of 13,026 people with type 2 diabetes\nand CKD from both FIDELIO-DKD and\nFIGARO-DKD, the HRs for the composite of\ncardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal\nstroke, or hospitalization for heart failure\nas well as a composite of kidney failure, a\nsustained $57% decrease in eGFR from\nbaseline over $4 weeks, or renal death\nwere 0.86 and 0.77, respectively (188).\nThese collective studies indicate that \ufb01nere-\nnone improves cardiovascular and renal\noutcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.\nTherefore, in people with type 2 diabe-\ntes and CKD with albuminuria treated\nwith maximum tolerated doses of ACE\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nCardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\nS183\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "inhibitor or ARB, addition of \ufb01nernone\nshould be considered to improve car-\ndiovascular outcomes and reduce the\nrisk of CKD progression.\nClinical Approach\nAs has been carefully outlined in Fig. 9.3\nin the preceding Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic\nApproaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes with or at high\nrisk for ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD\nshould be treated with a cardioprotective\nSGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 receptor ago-\nnist as part of the comprehensive ap-\nproach to cardiovascular and kidney risk\nreduction. Importantly, these agents\nshould be included in the regimen of care\nirrespective of the need for additional\nglucose lowering, and irrespective of\nmetformin use. Such an approach has\nalso been described in the American Di-\nabetes Association\u2013endorsed American\nCollege of Cardiology \u201c2020 Expert Con-\nsensus Decision Pathway on Novel\nTherapies for Cardiovascular Risk Re-\nduction in Patients With Type 2 Dia-\nbetes\u201d (234). Figure 10.3, reproduced\nfrom that decision pathway, outlines\nthe approach to risk reduction with\nSGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor ago-\nnist therapy in conjunction with other\ntraditional, guideline-based preventive\nmedical therapies for blood pressure,\nlipids, and glycemia and antiplatelet\ntherapy.\nAdoption of these agents should be\nreasonably straightforward in people with\nestablished cardiovascular or kidney dis-\nease who are later diagnosed with dia-\nbetes, as the cardioprotective agents can\nbe used from the outset of diabetes\nmanagement. On the other hand, incor-\nporation of SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 re-\nceptor agonist therapy in the care of\nindividuals with more long-standing dia-\nbetes may be more challenging, particu-\nlarly if patients are using an already\ncomplex glucose-lowering regimen. In\nsuch patients, SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1\nreceptor agonist therapy may need to\nreplace some or all of their existing med-\nications to minimize risks of hypoglyce-\nmia and adverse side effects, and\npotentially to minimize medication\ncosts. Close collaboration between pri-\nmary and specialty care professionals\ncan help to facilitate these transitions in\nclinical care and, in turn, improve out-\ncomes for highrisk people with type 2\ndiabetes.\nReferences\n1.

A\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES AND\nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is diag-\nnosed by the persistent elevation of\nurinary albumin excretion (albuminuria),\nlow estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration\nrate (eGFR), or other manifestations of\nkidney damage (1,2). In this section, the\nfocus is on CKD attributed to diabetes\n(diabetic kidney disease) in adults,\nwhich occurs in 20\u201340% of people with\ndiabetes (1,3\u20135). Diabetic kidney disease\ntypically develops after a diabetes dura-\ntion of 10 years in type 1 diabetes (the\nmost common presentation is 5\u201315 years\nafter the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes)\nbut may be present at diagnosis of type 2\ndiabetes. CKD can progress to end-stage\nrenal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or\nkidney transplantation and is the leading\ncause of ESRD in the U.S. (6). In addition,\namong people with type 1 or type 2 dia-\nbetes, the presence of CKD markedly in-\ncreases cardiovascular risk and health\ncare costs (7). For details on the manage-\nment of diabetic kidney disease in chil-\ndren, please see section 14, \u201cChildren\nand Adolescents.\u201d\nASSESSMENT OF ALBUMINURIA\nAND ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR\nFILTRATION RATE\nScreening for albuminuria can be most\neasily performed by urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot\nurine collection (1,2). Timed or 24-h col-\nlections are more burdensome and add\nlittle to prediction or accuracy. Measure-\nment of a spot urine sample for albumin\nalone (whether by immunoassay or by\nusing a sensitive dipstick test speci\ufb01c\nfor albuminuria) without simultaneously\nmeasuring urine creatinine is less ex-\npensive but susceptible to false-negative\nand false-positive determinations as a re-\nsult of variation in urine concentration\ndue to hydration (8). Thus, to be useful\nfor patient screening, semiquantita-\ntive or qualitative (dipstick) screening\ntests should be >85% positive in those\nwith moderately increased albuminuria\n($30 mg/g) and con\ufb01rmed by albumin-\nto-creatinine values in an accredited lab-\noratory (9,10). Hence, it is better to\nsimply collect a spot urine sample for\nalbumin-to-creatinine ratio because it\nwill ultimately need to be done.\nNormal albuminuria is de\ufb01ned as\n<30 mg/g creatinine, moderately elevated\nalbuminuria is de\ufb01ned as $30\u2013300 mg/g\ncreatinine, and severely elevated albu-\nminuria is de\ufb01ned as $300 mg/g creati-\nnine. However, UACR is a continuous\nmeasurement, and differences within\nthe normal and abnormal ranges are\nassociated with renal and cardiovascular\noutcomes (7,11,12). Furthermore, be-\ncause of high biological variability of\n>20% between measurements in uri-\nnary albumin excretion, two of three\nspecimens of UACR collected within a\n3- to 6-month period should be abnormal\nbefore considering a patient to have\nmoderately or severely elevated albu-\nminuria (1,2,13,14). Exercise within 24 h,\ninfection, fever, congestive heart failure,\nmarked hyperglycemia, menstruation,\nand marked hypertension may elevate\nUACR independently of kidney damage\n(15).\nTraditionally, eGFR is calculated from\nserum creatinine using a validated formula\n(16). The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemi-\nology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation is\npreferred (2). eGFR is routinely reported\nby laboratories along with serum creati-\nnine, and eGFR calculators are available\nonline at nkdep.nih.gov. An eGFR persis-\ntently <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in concert\nwith a urinary albumin value of >30 mg/g\ncreatinine is considered abnormal, though\noptimal thresholds for clinical diagnosis are\ndebated in older adults over age 70 years\n(2,17). Historically, a correction factor for\nmuscle mass was included in a modi\ufb01ed\nequation for African American people;\nhowever, race is a social and not a biologic\nconstruct, making it problematic to apply\nrace to clinical algorithms, and the need to\nadvance health equity and social justice is\nclear. Thus, it was decided that the equa-\ntion should be altered such that it applies\nto all (16). Hence, a committee was con-\nvened, resulting in the recommendation\nfor immediate implementation of the\nCKD-EPI creatinine equation re\ufb01t without\nthe race variable in all laboratories in the\nU.S. Additionally, increased use of cystatin\nC (another marker of eGFR) is suggested in\ncombination with the serum creatinine be-\ncause combining \ufb01ltration markers (creati-\nnine and cystatin C) is more accurate and\nwould support better clinical decisions\nthan either marker alone.\nDIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC KIDNEY\nDISEASE\nDiabetic kidney disease is usually a clini-\ncal diagnosis made based on the pres-\nence of albuminuria and/or reduced\neGFR in the absence of signs or symp-\ntoms of other primary causes of kidney\ndamage. The typical presentation of\ndiabetic kidney disease is considered to\ninclude a long-standing duration of dia-\nbetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without\ngross hematuria, and gradually progres-\nsive loss of eGFR.

    "text": "diabetic kidney disease may be present\nat diagnosis or without retinopathy in\ntype 2 diabetes. Reduced eGFR without\nalbuminuria has been frequently re-\nported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nand is becoming more common over\ntime as the prevalence of diabetes in-\ncreases in the U.S. (3,4,18,19).\nAn active urinary sediment (containing\nred or white blood cells or cellular casts),\nrapidly increasing albuminuria or total\nproteinuria, the presence of nephrotic\nsyndrome, rapidly decreasing eGFR, or\nthe absence of retinopathy (in type 1 di-\nabetes) suggests alternative or additional\ncauses of kidney disease. For patients\nwith these features, referral to a ne-\nphrologist for further diagnosis, including\nthe possibility of kidney biopsy, should\nbe considered. It is rare for people with\ntype 1 diabetes to develop kidney dis-\nease without retinopathy. In type 2 dia-\nbetes, retinopathy is only moderately\nsensitive and speci\ufb01c for CKD caused by\ndiabetes, as con\ufb01rmed by kidney biopsy\n(20).\nSTAGING OF CHRONIC KIDNEY\nDISEASE\nStage 1 and stage 2 CKD are de\ufb01ned by\nevidence of high albuminuria with eGFR\n$60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and stages 3\u20135\nCKD are de\ufb01ned by progressively lower\nranges of eGFR (21) (Fig. 11.1). At any\neGFR, the degree of albuminuria is asso-\nciated with risk of cardiovascular disease\n(CVD), CKD progression, and mortality\n(7). Therefore, Kidney Disease: Improving\nGlobal Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends\na more comprehensive CKD staging that\nincorporates albuminuria at all stages of\neGFR; this system is more closely associ-\nated with risk but is also more complex\nand does not translate directly to treat-\nment decisions (2). Thus, based on the\ncurrent classi\ufb01cation system, both eGFR\nand albuminuria must be quanti\ufb01ed to\nguide treatment decisions. This is also im-\nportant because eGFR levels are essential\nfor modi\ufb01cations of drug dosages or re-\nstrictions of use (Fig. 11.1) (22,23). The\ndegree of albuminuria should in\ufb02uence\nthe choice of antihypertensive medica-\ntions (see Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular\nDisease and Risk Management\u201d) or gluco-\nse-lowering medications (see below). Ob-\nserved history of eGFR loss (which is also\nassociated with risk of CKD progression\nand other adverse health outcomes) and\ncause of kidney damage (including\npossible causes other than diabetes)\nmay also affect these decisions (24).\nACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed by\na 50% or greater sustained increase in se-\nrum creatinine over a short period of\ntime, which is also re\ufb02ected as a rapid\ndecrease in eGFR (25,26). People with di-\nabetes are at higher risk of AKI than\nthose without diabetes (27). Other risk\nfactors for AKI include preexisting CKD,\nthe use of medications that cause kidney\ninjury (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory\ndrugs), and the use of medications that\nalter renal blood \ufb02ow and intrarenal he-\nmodynamics. In particular, many antihy-\npertensive medications (e.g., diuretics,\nACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor\nblockers [ARBs]) can reduce intravascular\nvolume, renal blood \ufb02ow, and/or glo-\nmerular \ufb01ltration. There was concern\nthat sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2\n(SGLT2) inhibitors may promote AKI\nthrough volume depletion, particularly\nwhen combined with diuretics or other\nmedications that reduce glomerular \ufb01l-\ntration; however, this has not been\nfound to be true in randomized clinical\noutcome trials of advanced kidney dis-\nease (28) or high CVD risk with normal\nkidney function (29\u201331). It is also note-\nworthy that the nonsteroidal mineralocor-\nticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) do not\nincrease the risk of AKI when used to\nslow kidney disease progression (32).\nTimely identi\ufb01cation and treatment of\nAKI is important because AKI is associated\nwith increased risks of progressive CKD\nand other poor health outcomes (33).\nElevations in serum creatinine (up to\n30% from baseline) with renin-angioten-\nsin system (RAS) blockers (such as ACE in-\nhibitors and ARBs) must not be confused\nwith AKI (34). An analysis of the Action to\nControl Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes\nBlood Pressure (ACCORD BP) trial demon-\nstrates that participants randomized to in-\ntensive blood pressure lowering with up\nto a 30% increase in serum creatinine did\nnot have any increase in mortality or pro-\ngressive kidney disease (35\u201338). More-\nover, a measure of markers for AKI\nshowed no signi\ufb01cant increase of any\nmarkers with increased creatinine (37).\nAccordingly, ACE inhibitors and ARBs\nshould not be discontinued for increases\nin serum creatinine (<30%) in the ab-\nsence of volume depletion.\nLastly, it should be noted that ACE\ninhibitors and ARBs are commonly not\ndosed at maximum tolerated doses\nbecause of fear that serum creatinine\nwill rise. As noted above, this is an error.\nNote that in all clinical trials demonstrat-\ning ef\ufb01cacy of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in\nslowing kidney disease progression, the\nmaximum tolerated doses were used\u2014\nnot very low doses that do not provide\nbene\ufb01t. Moreover, there are now studies\ndemonstrating outcome bene\ufb01ts on both\nmortality and slowed CKD progression in\npeople with diabetes who have an eGFR\n<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (38). Addition-\nally, when increases in serum creati-\nnine reach 30% without associated\nhyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be\ncontinued (36,39).\nSURVEILLANCE\nBoth albuminuria and eGFR should be\nmonitored annually to enable timely di-\nagnosis of CKD, monitor progression of\nCKD, detect superimposed kidney dis-\neases including AKI, assess risk of CKD\ncomplications, dose drugs appropriately,\nand determine whether nephrology re-\nferral is needed. Among people with ex-\nisting kidney disease, albuminuria and\neGFR may change due to progression of\nCKD, development of a separate super-\nimposed cause of kidney disease, AKI,\nor other effects of medications, as\nnoted above. Serum potassium should\nalso be monitored in patients treated\nwith diuretics because these medica-\ntions can cause hypokalemia, which is\nassociated with cardiovascular risk and\nmortality (40\u201342). Patients with eGFR\n<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving ACE in-\nhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs should have se-\nrum potassium measured periodically.\nAdditionally, people with this lower\nrange of eGFR should have their medi-\ncation dosing veri\ufb01ed, their exposure to\nnephrotoxins (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-\nin\ufb02ammatory drugs and iodinated con-\ntrast) should be minimized, and they\nshould be evaluated for potential CKD\ncomplications (Table 11.1).\nThere is a clear need for annual quanti-\ntative assessment of urinary albumin\nexcretion. This is especially true after a di-\nagnosis of albuminuria, institution of ACE\ninhibitors or ARB therapy to maximum\ntolerated doses, and achievement of\nblood pressure targets.

    "text": "kidney function may be detected by in-\ncreases in albuminuria before changes\nin eGFR (43), and this also signi\ufb01cantly\naffects cardiovascular risk. Moreover, an\ninitial reduction of >30% from baseline,\nsubsequently maintained over at least 2\nyears, is considered a valid surrogate for\nrenal bene\ufb01t by the Division of Cardiology\nand Nephrology of the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) (10). Contin-\nued surveillance can assess both response\nto therapy and disease progression and\nmay aid in assessing participation in ACE\ninhibitor or ARB therapy. In addition, in\nclinical trials of ACE inhibitors or ARB\ntherapy in type 2 diabetes, reducing albu-\nminuria to levels <300 mg/g creatinine\nor by >30% from baseline has been asso-\nciated with improved renal and cardiovas-\ncular outcomes, leading some to suggest\nthat medications should be titrated to\nmaximize reduction in UACR. Data from\npost hoc analyses demonstrate less ben-\ne\ufb01t on cardiorenal outcomes at half\ndoses of RAS blockade (44). In type 1 di-\nabetes, remission of albuminuria may\noccur spontaneously, and cohort studies\nevaluating associations of change in al-\nbuminuria with clinical outcomes have\nreported inconsistent results (45,46).\nThe prevalence of CKD complications\ncorrelates with eGFR (42). When eGFR is\n<60\nmL/min/1.73\nm2,\nscreening\nfor\ncomplications of CKD is indicated (Table\n11.1). Early vaccination against hepatitis\nB virus is indicated in individuals likely\nto progress to ESRD (see Section 4,\n\u201cComprehensive Medical Evaluation and\nAssessment of Comorbidities,\u201d for further\ninformation on immunization).\nPrevention\nThe only proven primary prevention inter-\nventions for CKD are blood glucose and\nblood pressure control. There is no evi-\ndence that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem (RAAS) inhibitors or any other\ninterventions prevent the development\nof diabetic kidney disease. Thus, the\nAmerican Diabetes Association does\nnot recommend routine use of these\nmedications solely for the purpose of\nprevention of the development of di-\nabetic kidney disease.\nINTERVENTIONS\nNutrition\nFor people with non-dialysis-dependent\nCKD, dietary protein intake should be\n\u00010.8 g/kg body weight per day (the rec-\nommended daily allowance) (1). Com-\npared with higher levels of dietary protein\nintake, this level slowed GFR decline with\nevidence of a greater effect over time.\nHigher levels of dietary protein intake\n(>20% of daily calories from protein or\n>1.3 g/kg/day) have been associated\nwith increased albuminuria, more rapid\nkidney function loss, and CVD mortality\nand therefore should be avoided. Reduc-\ning the amount of dietary protein below\nthe recommended daily allowance of\n0.8 g/kg/day is not recommended be-\ncause it does not alter blood glucose\nlevels, cardiovascular risk measures, or\nthe course of GFR decline (47).\nRestriction of dietary sodium (to <2,300\nmg/day) may be useful to control blood\npressure and reduce cardiovascular risk\n(48,49), and individualization of die-\ntary potassium may be necessary to con-\ntrol serum potassium concentrations\n(27,40\u201342). These interventions may\nbe most important for individuals with\nreduced eGFR, for whom urinary excre-\ntion of sodium and potassium may be\nimpaired. For patients on dialysis, higher\nlevels of dietary protein intake should be\nconsidered since malnutrition is a major\nproblem for some patients on dialysis\n(50). Recommendations for dietary so-\ndium and potassium intake should be\nindividualized based on comorbid condi-\ntions, medication use, blood pressure,\nand laboratory data.\nGlycemic Targets\nIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia\nhas been shown in large randomized\nstudies to delay the onset and pro-\ngression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes\n(51,52) and type 2 diabetes (1,53\u201358).\nInsulin alone was used to lower blood\nglucose in the Diabetes Control and\nComplications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology\nof Diabetes Interventions and Complica-\ntions (EDIC) study of type 1 diabetes,\nwhile a variety of agents were used\nin clinical trials of type 2 diabetes,\nsupporting the conclusion that lower-\ning blood glucose itself helps prevent\nCKD and its progression. The effects\nof glucose-lowering therapies on CKD\nhave helped de\ufb01ne A1C targets (see\nTable 6.2).\nThe presence of CKD affects the risks\nand bene\ufb01ts of intensive lowering of\nblood glucose and a number of speci\ufb01c\nglucose-lowering medications. In the Ac-\ntion to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Dia-\nbetes (ACCORD) trial of type 2 diabetes,\nadverse effects of intensive management\nof blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia\nand mortality) were increased among\npeople with kidney disease at baseline\n(59,60). Moreover, there is a lag time\nof at least 2 years in type 2 diabetes to\nover 10 years in type 1 diabetes for the\neffects of intensive glucose control to\nmanifest as improved eGFR outcomes\n(56,60,61). Therefore, in some people\nwith prevalent CKD and substantial co-\nmorbidity, target A1C levels may be less\nintensive (1,62).\nTable 11.1\u2014Selected complications of chronic kidney disease\nComplication\nPhysical and laboratory evaluation\nBlood pressure >130/80 mmHg\nBlood pressure, weight\nVolume overload\nHistory, physical examination, weight\nElectrolyte abnormalities\nSerum electrolytes\nMetabolic acidosis\nSerum electrolytes\nAnemia\nHemoglobin; iron testing if indicated\nMetabolic bone disease\nSerum calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin 25(OH)D\nComplications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) generally become prevalent when estimated\nglomerular \ufb01ltration rate falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (stage 3 CKD or greater) and be-\ncome more common and severe as CKD progresses.

    "text": "Blood Pressure and Use of RAAS\nInhibitors\nRAAS inhibition remains a mainstay of\nmanagement for people with diabetic\nkidney disease with albuminuria and for\nthe treatment of hypertension in people\nwith diabetes (with or without diabetic\nkidney disease). Indeed, all the trials\nthat evaluated the bene\ufb01ts of SGLT2 in-\nhibition or nonsteroidal mineralocorti-\ncoid receptor antagonist effects were\ndone in individuals who were being\ntreated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, in\nsome trials up to maximum tolerated\ndoses.\nHypertension is a strong risk factor\nfor the development and progression\nof CKD (63). Antihypertensive ther-\napy reduces the risk of albuminuria\n(64\u201367),\nand\namong\npeople\nwith\ntype 1 or 2 diabetes with established\nCKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and\nUACR $300 mg/g creatinine), ACE in-\nhibitor or ARB therapy reduces the risk\nof progression to ESRD (68\u201370,74\u201380).\nMoreover, antihypertensive therapy re-\nduces the risk of cardiovascular events\n(64).\nA blood pressure level <130/80 mmHg\nis recommended to reduce CVD mortality\nand slow CKD progression among all\npeople with diabetes. Lower blood pres-\nsure targets (e.g., <130/80 mmHg)\nshould be considered for patients based\non individual anticipated bene\ufb01ts and\nrisks. People with CKD are at increased\nrisk of CKD progression (particularly\nthose with albuminuria) and CVD; there-\nfore, lower blood pressure targets may\nbe suitable in some cases, especially in\nindividuals with severely elevated albu-\nminuria ($300 mg/g creatinine).\nACE inhibitors or ARBs are the preferred\n\ufb01rst-line agents for blood pressure treat-\nment among people with diabetes, hyper-\ntension, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and\nUACR $300 mg/g creatinine because of\ntheir proven bene\ufb01ts for prevention of\nCKD progression (68,69,74). ACE inhibitors\nand ARBs are considered to have similar\nbene\ufb01ts (75,76) and risks. In the setting of\nlower levels of albuminuria (30\u2013299 mg/g\ncreatinine), ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy\nat maximum tolerated doses in trials has\nreduced progression to more advanced\nalbuminuria ($300 mg/g creatinine),\nslowed CKD progression, and reduced car-\ndiovascular events but has not reduced\nprogression to ESRD (74,77). While ACE\ninhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed for\nmoderately increased albuminuria with-\nout hypertension, outcome trials have\nnot been performed in this setting to\ndetermine whether they improve renal\noutcomes. Moreover, two long-term, dou-\nble-blind studies demonstrated no reno-\nprotective effect of either ACE inhibitors\nor ARBs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes\namong those who were normotensive\nwith or without high albuminuria (for-\nmerly microalbuminuria) (78,79).\nAbsent kidney disease, ACE inhibitors\nor ARBs are useful to manage blood\npressure but have not proven superior\nto alternative classes of antihypertensive\ntherapy, including thiazide-like diuretics\nand\ndihydropyridine\ncalcium\nchannel\nblockers (80). In a trial of people with\ntype 2 diabetes and normal urinary albu-\nmin excretion, an ARB reduced or sup-\npressed the development of albuminuria\nbut increased the rate of cardiovascular\nevents (81). In a trial of people with\ntype 1 diabetes exhibiting neither albu-\nminuria nor hypertension, ACE inhibitors\nor ARBs did not prevent the development\nof diabetic glomerulopathy assessed by\nkidney biopsy (78). This was further sup-\nported by a similar trial in people with\ntype 2 diabetes (79).\nTwo clinical trials studied the combina-\ntions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and found\nno bene\ufb01ts on CVD or CKD, and the drug\ncombination had higher adverse event\nrates (hyperkalemia and/or AKI) (82,83).\nTherefore, the combined use of ACE inhibi-\ntors and ARBs should be avoided.\nDirect Renal Effects of Glucose-\nLowering Medications\nSome glucose-lowering medications also\nhave effects on the kidney that are di-\nrect, i.e., not mediated through glycemia.\nFor example, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce re-\nnal tubular glucose reabsorption, weight,\nsystemic blood pressure, intraglomerular\npressure, and albuminuria and slow GFR\nloss through mechanisms that appear in-\ndependent of glycemia (30,84\u201387). More-\nover, recent data support the notion that\nSGLT2 inhibitors reduce oxidative stress\nin the kidney by >50% and blunt in-\ncreases in angiotensinogen as well as\nreduce NLRP3 in\ufb02ammasome activity\n(88\u201390). Glucagon-like peptide 1 recep-\ntor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) also have direct\neffects on the kidney and have been\nreported to improve renal outcomes\ncompared with placebo (91\u201395). Renal\neffects should be considered when\nselecting antihyperglycemia agents (see\nSection 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to\nGlycemic Treatment\u201d).\nSelection of Glucose-Lowering\nMedications for People With Chronic\nKidney Disease\nFor people with type 2 diabetes and es-\ntablished CKD, special considerations for\nthe selection of glucose-lowering medica-\ntions include limitations to available med-\nications when eGFR is diminished and a\ndesire to mitigate risks of CKD progres-\nsion, CVD, and hypoglycemia (96,97).\nDrug dosing may require modi\ufb01cation\nwith eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1).\nThe FDA revised its guidance for the\nuse of metformin in CKD in 2016 (98),\nrecommending use of eGFR instead of\nserum creatinine to guide treatment and\nexpanding the pool of people with kidney\ndisease for whom metformin treatment\nshould be considered. The revised FDA\nguidance states that 1) metformin is\ncontraindicated in patients with an eGFR\n<30 mL/min/1.73 m2, 2) eGFR should\nbe monitored while taking metformin,\n3) the bene\ufb01ts and risks of continuing\ntreatment should be reassessed when\neGFR falls to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2\n(99,100),\n4)\nmetformin should not\nbe initiated for patients with an eGFR\n<45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 5) metformin\nshould be temporarily discontinued at\nthe time of or before iodinated contrast\nimaging procedures in patients with\neGFR 30\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nA number of recent studies have\nshown cardiovascular protection from\nSGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs as\nwell as renal protection from SGLT2 in-\nhibitors and possibly from GLP-1 RAs.\nSelection of which glucose-lowering medi-\ncations to use should be based on the\nusual criteria of an individual patient\u2019s\nrisks (cardiovascular and renal in addition\nto glucose control) as well as convenience\nand cost.\nSGLT2 inhibitors are recommended\nfor people with stage 3 CKD or higher\nand type 2 diabetes, as they slow CKD\nprogression and reduce heart failure\nrisk independent of glucose manage-\nment (101). GLP-1 RAs are suggested\nfor cardiovascular risk reduction if such\nrisk is a predominant problem, as they\nreduce risks of CVD events and hypogly-\ncemia and appear to possibly slow CKD\nprogression (102\u2013105).\nS196\nChronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

These trials in-\nclude EMPA-REG OUTCOME [BI 10773\n(Empagli\ufb02ozin) Cardiovascular Outcome\nEvent Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\nPatients], CANVAS (Canagli\ufb02ozin Cardio-\nvascular Assessment Study), LEADER (Lira-\nglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes:\nEvaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Re-\nsults), and SUSTAIN-6 (Trial to Evaluate\nCardiovascular and Other Long-term Out-\ncomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With\nType 2 Diabetes) (71,86,91,94,102). Spe-\nci\ufb01cally, compared with placebo, empagli-\n\ufb02ozin reduced the risk of incident or\nworsening nephropathy (a composite of\nprogression to UACR >300 mg/g creati-\nnine, doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD,\nor death from ESRD) by 39% and the risk\nof doubling of serum creatinine accompa-\nnied by eGFR #45 mL/min/1.73 m2 by\n44%; canagli\ufb02ozin reduced the risk of pro-\ngression of albuminuria by 27% and the\nrisk of reduction in eGFR, ESRD, or death\nfrom ESRD by 40%; liraglutide reduced\nthe risk of new or worsening nephropa-\nthy (a composite of persistent macroal-\nbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine,\nESRD, or death from ESRD) by 22%; and\nsemaglutide reduced the risk of new or\nworsening nephropathy (a composite of\npersistent UACR >300 mg/g creatinine,\ndoubling of serum creatinine, or ESRD)\nby 36% (each P < 0.01). These analyses\nwere limited by evaluation of study pop-\nulations not selected primarily for CKD\nand examination of renal effects as sec-\nondary outcomes.\nSome large clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibi-\ntors have focused on people with ad-\nvanced CKD, and assessment of primary\nrenal outcomes is either completed or on-\ngoing. Canagli\ufb02ozin and Renal Events in Di-\nabetes\nwith\nEstablished\nNephropathy\nClinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), a placebo-\ncontrolled trial of canagli\ufb02ozin among\n4,401 adults with type 2 diabetes, UACR\n$300\u20135,000 mg/g creatinine, and eGFR\nrange 30\u201390 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean\neGFR 56 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a mean\nalbuminuria level of >900 mg/day),\nhad a primary composite end point of\nESRD, doubling of serum creatinine, or\nrenal or cardiovascular death (28,72). It\nwas stopped early due to positive ef\ufb01-\ncacy and showed a 32% risk reduction\nfor development of ESRD over control\n(28). Additionally, the development of\nthe primary end point, which included\nchronic dialysis for $30 days, kidney\ntransplantation or eGFR <15 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 sustained for $30 days by cen-\ntral\nlaboratory\nassessment,\ndoubling\nfrom the baseline serum creatinine aver-\nage sustained for $30 days by central\nlaboratory assessment, or renal death or\ncardiovascular death, was reduced by\n30%. This bene\ufb01t was on background\nACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in >99% of\nthe patients (28). Moreover, in this ad-\nvanced CKD group, there were clear\nbene\ufb01ts on cardiovascular outcomes dem-\nonstrating a 31% reduction in cardiovascu-\nlar death or heart failure hospitalization\nand a 20% reduction in cardiovascular\ndeath, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or\nnonfatal stroke (28,73,105).\nA second trial in advanced diabetic\nkidney disease was the Dapagli\ufb02ozin and\nPrevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chro-\nnic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) study\n(106). This trial examined a cohort similar\nto that in CREDENCE except 67.5% of the\nparticipants had type 2 diabetes and CKD\n(the other one-third had CKD without\ntype 2 diabetes), and the end points\nwere slightly different. The primary out-\ncome was time to the \ufb01rst occurrence of\nany of the components of the composite,\nincluding $50% sustained decline in\neGFR or reaching ESRD or cardiovascular\ndeath, or renal death. Secondary out-\ncome measures included time to the \ufb01rst\noccurrence of any of the components of\nthe composite kidney outcome ($50%\nsustained decline in eGFR or reaching\nESRD or renal death), time to the \ufb01rst oc-\ncurrence of either of the components of\nthe cardiovascular composite (cardiovas-\ncular death or hospitalization for heart\nfailure), and time to death from any\ncause. The trial had 4,304 participants\nwith a mean eGFR at baseline of 43.1 \u00b1\n12.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 25\u201375 mL/min/\n1.73 m2) and a median UACR of 949 mg/g\n(range 200\u20135,000 mg/g). There was a\nsigni\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t by dapagli\ufb02ozin for\nthe primary end point (hazard ratio\n[HR] 0.61 [95% CI 0.51\u20130.72]; P <\n0.001) (106).\nThe HR for the kidney composite of a\nsustained decline in eGFR of $50%,\nESRD, or death from renal causes was\n0.56 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.68; P < 0.001). The\nHR for the composite of death from\ncardiovascular causes or hospitalization\nfor heart failure was 0.71 (95% CI\n0.55\u20130.92; P 5 0.009). Finally, all-cause\nmortality was decreased in the dapagli-\n\ufb02ozin group compared with the placebo\ngroup (P < 0.004).\nIn addition to renal effects, while\nSGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated reduced\nrisk of\nheart\nfailure\nhospitalizations,\nsome also demonstrated cardiovascular\nrisk reduction. GLP-1 RAs clearly demon-\nstrated cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts. Namely,\nin the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS,\nDapagli\ufb02ozin Effect on Cardiovascular\nEvents\u2013Thrombolysis in Myocardial In-\nfarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58), LEADER,\nand SUSTAIN-6 trials, empagli\ufb02ozin, can-\nagli\ufb02ozin, dapagli\ufb02ozin, liraglutide, and\nsemaglutide, respectively, each reduced\ncardiovascular events, evaluated as pri-\nmary outcomes, compared with placebo\n(see Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease\nand Risk Management,\u201d for further discus-\nsion). While the glucose-lowering effects\nof SGLT2 inhibitors are blunted with eGFR\n<45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the renal and car-\ndiovascular bene\ufb01ts were still seen at\neGFR levels of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 with\nno signi\ufb01cant change in glucose (28,30,\n51,62,71,94,106,107).\nMost\nparticipants\nwith CKD in these trials also had diag-\nnosed atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-\nease (ASCVD) at baseline, although \u000128%\nof CANVAS participants with CKD did not\nhave diagnosed ASCVD (31).\nBased on evidence from the CREDENCE\nand DAPA-CKD trials, as well as secondary\nanalyses of cardiovascular outcomes trials\nwith SGLT2 inhibitors, cardio-vascular and\nrenal events are reduced with SGLT2 in-\nhibitor use in patients with an eGFR of\n20 mL/min/1.73 m2, independent of glu-\ncose-lowering effects (73,105).\nWhile there is clear cardiovascular\nrisk reduction associated with GLP-1 RA\nuse in people with type 2 diabetes and\nCKD, the proof of bene\ufb01t on renal out-\ncomes will come with the results of the\nongoing FLOW (A Research Study to See\nHow\nSemaglutide\nWorks\nCompared\nwith Placebo in People With Type 2 Dia-\nbetes and Chronic Kidney Disease) trial\nwith injectable semaglutide (108). As\nnoted above, published data address\na limited group of people with CKD,\nmostly with coexisting ASCVD.

This is a\nchange in eGFR from previous recom-\nmendations that suggested an eGFR level\n>25 mL/min/1.73 m2.The reason for the\nlower limit of eGFR is as follows.The ma-\njor clinical trials for SGLT2 inhibitors that\nshowed bene\ufb01t for people with dia-\nbetic kidney disease are CREDENCE and\nDAPA-CKD (28,105). CREDENCE enrollment\ncriteria included an eGFR >30 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 and UACR >300 mg/g (28,105).\nDAPA-CKD enrolled individuals with\neGFR >25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR\n>200 mg/g. Subgroup analyses from\nDAPA-CKD (109) and analyses from the\nEMPEROR heart failure trials suggest\nthat SGLT2 inhibitors are safe and effec-\ntive at eGFR levels of >20 mL/min/1.73 m2.\nThe Empagli\ufb02ozin Outcome Trial in Pa-\ntients With Chronic Heart Failure With\nPreserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-\nPreserved) enrolled 5,998 participants\n(110), and the Empagli\ufb02ozin Outcome\nTrial in Patients With Chronic Heart\nFailure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction\n(EMPEROR-Reduced) enrolled 3,730 par-\nticipants (111); enrollment criteria in-\ncluded eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, but\nef\ufb01cacy was seen at eGFR >20 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 in people with heart failure.\nHence, the new recommendation is to\nuse SGLT2 inhibitors in individuals with\neGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. In\naddition, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial sug-\ngested effectiveness in participants with\nnormal urinary albumin levels (112). In\nsum, for people with type 2 diabetes and\ndiabetic kidney disease, use of an SGLT2\ninhibitor is recommended to reduce CKD\nprogression and cardiovascular events\nin people with an eGFR $20 mL/min/\n1.73 m2.\nOf note, GLP-1 RAs may also be used\nat low eGFR for cardiovascular protection\nbut may require dose adjustment (113).\nRenal and Cardiovascular Outcomes\nof Mineralocorticoid Receptor\nAntagonists in Chronic Kidney\nDisease\nMRAs historically have not been well\nstudied in diabetic kidney disease\nbecause of the risk of hyperkalemia\n(114,115). However, data that do exist\nsuggest sustained bene\ufb01t on albumin-\nuria reduction. There are two different\nclasses of MRAs, steroidal and nonste-\nroidal, with one group not extrapolat-\nable to the other (116). Late in 2020,\nthe results of the \ufb01rst of two trials, the\nFinerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure\nand Disease Progression in Diabetic Kid-\nney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) trial, which ex-\namined the renal effects of \ufb01nerenone,\ndemonstrated a signi\ufb01cant reduction in\ndiabetic kidney disease progression and\ncardiovascular events in people with ad-\nvanced diabetic kidney disease (32,117).\nThis trial had a primary end point of time\nto \ufb01rst occurrence of the composite end\npoint of onset of kidney failure, a sus-\ntained decrease of eGFR >40% from\nbaseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal\ndeath. A prespeci\ufb01ed secondary outcome\nwas time to \ufb01rst occurrence of the com-\nposite end point cardiovascular death or\nnonfatal cardiovascular events (myocar-\ndial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization\nfor heart failure). Other secondary out-\ncomes included all-cause mortality, time\nto all-cause hospitalizations, and change\nin UACR from baseline to month 4, and\ntime to \ufb01rst occurrence of the following\ncomposite end point: onset of kidney\nfailure, a sustained decrease in eGFR\nof $57% from baseline over at least\n4 weeks, or renal death.\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled\ntrial randomized 5,734 people with CKD\nand type 2 diabetes to receive \ufb01nere-\nnone, a novel nonsteroidal MRA, or pla-\ncebo. Eligible participants had a UACR\nof 30 to <300 mg/g, an eGFR of 25 to\n<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and diabetic reti-\nnopathy, or a UACR of 300\u20135,000 mg/g\nand an eGFR of 25 to <75 mL/min/\n1.73 m2. The mean age of participants\nwas 65.6 years, and 30% were female.\nThe mean eGFR was 44.3 mL/min/1.73 m2,\nand the mean albuminuria was 852 mg/g\n(interquartile range 446\u20131,634 mg/g).\nThe primary end point was reduced\nwith \ufb01nerenone compared with pla-\ncebo (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73\u20130.93]; P 5\n0.001), as was the key secondary com-\nposite of cardiovascular outcome (HR\n0.86 [95% CI 0.75\u20130.99]; P 5 0.03).\nHyperkalemia resulted in 2.3% discontin-\nuation in the study group compared\nwith 0.9% in the placebo group. How-\never, the study was completed, and\nthere were no deaths related to hy-\nperkalemia. Of note, 4.5% of the total\ngroup were being treated with SGLT2\ninhibitors.\nThe Finerenone in Reducing Cardio-\nvascular Mortality and Morbidity in Di-\nabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD)\ntrial assessed the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of\n\ufb01nerenone in reducing cardiovascular\nevents among people with type 2\ndiabetes and CKD with elevated UACR\n(30 to <300 mg/g creatinine) and eGFR\n25\u201390 mL/min/1.73 m2 (118). The study\nrandomized eligible subjects to either \ufb01-\nnerenone (n 5 3,686) or placebo (n 5\n3,666). Participants with an eGFR of\n25\u201360 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the screening\nvisit received an initial dose at baseline\nof 10 mg once daily, and if eGFR at\nscreening was $60 mL/min/1.73 m2,\nthe initial dose was 20 mg once daily. An\nincrease in the dose from 10 to 20 mg\nonce daily was encouraged after 1 month,\nprovided the serum potassium level was\n#4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was stable. The\nmean age of participants was 64.1 years\n(31% were female), and the median follow-\nup duration was 3.4 years.The median A1C\nwas 7.7%, the mean systolic blood pres-\nsure was 136 mmHg, and the mean\nGFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m2. People\nwith heart failure with a reduced ejection\nfraction and uncontrolled hypertension\nwere excluded.\nThe primary composite outcome was\ncardiovascular death, myocardial infarc-\ntion, stroke, and hospitalization for heart\nfailure. The \ufb01nerenone group showed\na 13% reduction in the primary end point\ncompared with the placebo group (12.4%\nvs. 14.2%; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76\u20130.98];\nP 5 0.03). This bene\ufb01t was primarily\ndriven by a reduction in heart failure hos-\npitalizations: 3.2% vs. 4.4% in the placebo\ngroup (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56\u20130.90]).\nOf the secondary outcomes, the most\nnoteworthy was a 36% reduction in end-\nstage kidney disease: 0.9% vs. 1.3% in\nS198\nChronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

There was a higher inci-\ndence of hyperkalemia in the \ufb01nerenone\ngroup, 10.8% vs. 5.3%, although only 1.2%\nof the 3,686 individuals on \ufb01nerenone\nstopped the study due to hyperkalemia\n(0.6% vs. 0.4% of the placebo group).\nThe FIDELITY prespeci\ufb01ed pooled ef\ufb01-\ncacy and safety analysis incorporated\nindividuals from both the FIGARO-DKD\nand FIDELIO-DKD trials (N 5 13,171) to\nallow for evaluation across the spec-\ntrum of severity of CKD, since the popu-\nlations were different (with a slight\noverlap) and the study designs were\nsimilar (119). The analysis showed a\n14% reduction in composite cardiovascu-\nlar death, nonfatal myocardial infarction,\nnonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for\nheart failure for \ufb01nerenone vs. placebo\n(12.7% vs. 14.4%; HR 0.86 [95% CI\n0.78\u20130.95]; P 5 0.0018).\nIt also demonstrated a 23% reduction\nin the composite kidney outcome, consist-\ning of sustained $57% decrease in eGFR\nfrom baseline over $4 weeks, or renal\ndeath, for \ufb01nerenone vs. placebo (5.5%\nvs. 7.1%; HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67\u20130.88];\nP 5 0.0002).\nThe\npooled\nFIDELITY\ntrial\nanalysis\ncon\ufb01rms and strengthens the positive car-\ndiovascular and renal outcomes with \ufb01-\nnerenone across the spectrum of CKD,\nirrespective of baseline ASCVD history\n(with the exclusion of those with heart\nfailure with reduced ejection fraction).\nREFERRAL TO A NEPHROLOGIST\nHealth care professionals should consider\nreferral to a nephrologist if the patient\nhas continuously rising UACR levels and/\nor continuously declining eGFR, if there is\nuncertainty about the etiology of kidney\ndisease, for dif\ufb01cult management issues\n(anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism,\nsigni\ufb01cant increases in albuminuria in\nspite of good blood pressure manage-\nment, metabolic bone disease, resistant\nhypertension, or electrolyte disturban-\nces), or when there is advanced kidney\ndisease (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) re-\nquiring discussion of renal replacement\ntherapy for ESRD (2). The threshold for\nreferral may vary depending on the fre-\nquency with which a health care profes-\nsional encounters people with diabetes\nand kidney disease. Consultation with\na nephrologist when stage 4 CKD develops\n(eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been\nfound to reduce cost, improve quality of\ncare, and delay dialysis (120). However,\nother specialists and health care professio-\nnals should also educate their patients\nabout the progressive nature of CKD, the\nkidney preservation bene\ufb01ts of proactive\ntreatment of blood pressure and blood\nglucose, and the potential need for renal\nreplacement therapy.\nReferences\n1.

A\n12.2\nOptimize blood pressure and serum lipid control to reduce the risk or\nslow the progression of diabetic retinopathy. A\nDiabetic retinopathy is a highly speci\ufb01c vascular complication of both type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes, with prevalence strongly related to both the duration of diabetes\nand the level of glycemic control (1). Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause\nof new cases of blindness among adults aged 20\u201374 years in developed countries.\nGlaucoma, cataracts, and other eye disorders occur earlier and more frequently in\npeople with diabetes.\nIn addition to diabetes duration, factors that increase the risk of, or are associ-\nated with, retinopathy include chronic hyperglycemia (2,3), nephropathy (4), hyper-\ntension (5), and dyslipidemia (6). Intensive diabetes management with the goal of\nachieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized\nstudies to prevent and/or delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy,\nreduce the need for future ocular surgical procedures, and potentially improve\npatient-reported visual function (2,7\u201310). A meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular\noutcomes studies showed no association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor\nagonist (GLP-1 RA) treatment and retinopathy per se, except through the association\nbetween retinopathy and average A1C reduction at the 3-month and 1-year follow-\nup. Long-term impact of improved glycemic control on retinopathy was not studied\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G, Aroda\nVR, et al., American Diabetes Association. 12.\nRetinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: Standards\nof Care in Diabetes\u20142023.

    "text": "in these trials. Retinopathy status should\nbe assessed when intensifying glucose-\nlowering therapies such as those using\nGLP-1 RAs, since rapid reductions in A1C\ncan be associated with initial worsening\nof retinopathy (11).\nScreening\nRecommendations\n12.3\nAdults with type 1 diabetes\nshould have an initial dilated\nand comprehensive eye exami-\nnation by an ophthalmologist\nor optometrist within 5 years\nafter the onset of diabetes. B\n12.4\nPeople with type 2 diabetes\nshould have an initial dilated\nand comprehensive eye exami-\nnation by an ophthalmologist\nor optometrist at the time of\nthe diabetes diagnosis. B\n12.5\nIf there is no evidence of reti-\nnopathy for one or more an-\nnual eye exams and glycemia\nis well controlled, then screen-\ning every 1\u20132 years may be\nconsidered. If any level of di-\nabetic retinopathy is present,\nsubsequent dilated retinal ex-\naminations should be repeated\nat least annually by an oph-\nthalmologist or optometrist. If\nretinopathy is progressing or\nsight-threatening, then exami-\nnations will be required more\nfrequently. B\n12.6\nPrograms that use retinal pho-\ntography (with remote reading\nor use of a validated assess-\nment tool) to improve access\nto diabetic retinopathy screen-\ning can be appropriate screen-\ning strategies for diabetic retino-\npathy. Such programs need to\nprovide pathways for timely re-\nferral for a comprehensive eye\nexamination when indicated. B\n12.7\nIndividuals of childbearing po-\ntential with preexisting type 1\nor type 2 diabetes who are\nplanning pregnancy or who are\npregnant should be counseled\non the risk of development\nand/or progression of diabetic\nretinopathy. B\n12.8\nIndividuals with preexisting\ntype 1 or type 2 diabetes should\nreceive an eye exam before\npregnancy and in the \ufb01rst\ntrimester and should be moni-\ntored every trimester and for\n1 year postpartum as indicated\nby the degree of retinopathy. B\nThe preventive effects of therapy and\nthe fact that individuals with prolifera-\ntive diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or macu-\nlar edema may be asymptomatic provide\nstrong support for screening to detect\ndiabetic retinopathy. Prompt diagnosis\nallows triage of patients and timely in-\ntervention that may prevent vision loss\nin individuals who are asymptomatic\ndespite advanced diabetic eye disease.\nDiabetic retinopathy screening should\nbe performed using validated approaches\nand methodologies. Youth with type 1 or\ntype 2 diabetes are also at risk for compli-\ncations and need to be screened for dia-\nbetic retinopathy (12) (see Section 14,\n\u201cChildren and Adolescents\u201d). If diabetic\nretinopathy is evident on screening, prompt\nreferral to an ophthalmologist is recom-\nmended. Subsequent examinations for\nindividuals with type 1 or type 2 diabe-\ntes are generally repeated annually for\nindividuals with minimal to no retinop-\nathy. Exams every 1\u20132 years may be\ncost-effective after one or more normal\neye exams. In a population with well-\ncontrolled type 2 diabetes, there was\nlittle risk of development of signi\ufb01cant\nretinopathy within a 3-year interval af-\nter a normal examination (13), and less\nfrequent intervals have been found in\nsimulated modeling to be potentially ef-\nfective in screening for diabetic retinop-\nathy in individuals without diabetic\nretinopathy (14). However, it is impor-\ntant to adjust screening intervals based\non the presence of speci\ufb01c risk factors\nfor retinopathy onset and worsening\nretinopathy. More frequent examina-\ntions by the ophthalmologist will be re-\nquired if retinopathy is progressing or risk\nfactors such as uncontrolled hyperglyce-\nmia, advanced baseline retinopathy, or\ndiabetic macular edema are present.\nRetinal photography with remote read-\ning by experts has great potential to pro-\nvide screening services in areas where\nquali\ufb01ed eye care professionals are not\nreadily available (15\u201317). High-quality fun-\ndus photographs can detect most clinically\nsigni\ufb01cant diabetic retinopathy. Interpreta-\ntion of the images should be performed\nby a trained eye care professional. Retinal\nphotography may also enhance ef\ufb01ciency\nand reduce costs when the expertise of\nophthalmologists can be used for more\ncomplex examinations and for therapy\n(15,18,19). In-person exams are still nec-\nessary when the retinal photos are of\nunacceptable quality and for follow-up if\nabnormalities are detected. Retinal pho-\ntos are not a substitute for dilated com-\nprehensive eye exams, which should be\nperformed at least initially and at yearly\nintervals thereafter or more frequently\nas recommended by an eye care profes-\nsional. Arti\ufb01cial intelligence systems that\ndetect more than mild diabetic retinopa-\nthy and diabetic macular edema, autho-\nrized for use by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), represent an alter-\nnative to traditional screening approaches\n(20). However, the bene\ufb01ts and optimal\nutilization of this type of screening have\nyet to be fully determined. Results of all\nscreening eye examinations should be\ndocumented and transmitted to the refer-\nring health care professional.\nType 1 Diabetes\nBecause retinopathy is estimated to take\nat least 5 years to develop after the on-\nset of hyperglycemia, people with\ntype 1 diabetes should have an initial\ndilated and comprehensive eye exami-\nnation within 5 years after the diagnosis\nof diabetes (21).\nType 2 Diabetes\nPeople with type 2 diabetes who may\nhave had years of undiagnosed diabetes\nand have a signi\ufb01cant risk of prevalent\ndiabetic retinopathy at the time of diag-\nnosis should have an initial dilated and\ncomprehensive eye examination at the\ntime of diagnosis.\nPregnancy\nIndividuals who develop gestational dia-\nbetes mellitus do not require eye ex-\naminations during pregnancy since they\ndo not appear to be at increased risk of\ndeveloping diabetic retinopathy during\npregnancy (22). However, individuals of\nchildbearing potential with preexisting\ntype 1 or type 2 diabetes who are plan-\nning pregnancy or who have become\npregnant should be counseled on the\nbaseline prevalence and risk of devel-\nopment and/or progression of diabetic\nretinopathy.

    "text": "type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the prevalence\nof any diabetic retinopathy and PDR in\nearly pregnancy was 52.3% and 6.1%, re-\nspectively. The pooled progression rate per\n100 pregnancies for new diabetic reti-\nnopathy development was 15.0 (95% CI\n9.9\u201320.8), worsened nonproliferative\ndiabetic retinopathy was 31.0 (95% CI\n23.2\u201339.2), pooled sight-threatening pro-\ngression rate from nonproliferative dia-\nbetic retinopathy to PDR was 6.3 (95% CI\n3.3\u201310.0), and worsened PDR was 37.0\n(95% CI 21.2\u201354.0), demonstrating that\nclose follow-up should be maintained\nduring pregnancy to prevent vision loss\n(23). In addition, rapid implementation\nof intensive glycemic management in\nthe setting of retinopathy is associ-\nated with early worsening of retinop-\nathy (24).\nA systematic review and meta-analysis\nand a controlled prospective study dem-\nonstrate that pregnancy in individuals\nwith type 1 diabetes may aggravate reti-\nnopathy and threaten vision, especially\nwhen glycemic control is poor or retinop-\nathy severity is advanced at the time of\nconception (23,24). Laser photocoagu-\nlation surgery can minimize the risk of\nvision loss during pregnancy for individ-\nuals with high-risk PDR or center-involved\ndiabetic macular edema (24). Anti\u2013vascular\nendothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) med-\nications should not be used in pregnant\nindividuals with diabetes because of the-\noretical risks to the vasculature of the\ndeveloping fetus.\nTreatment\nRecommendations\n12.9\nPromptly refer individuals with\nany level of diabetic macular\nedema, moderate or worse\nnonproliferative diabetic reti-\nnopathy (a precursor of pro-\nliferative diabetic retinopathy),\nor any proliferative diabetic\nretinopathy to an ophthalmol-\nogist who is knowledgeable and\nexperienced in the management\nof diabetic retinopathy. A\n12.10 Panretinal laser photocoagu-\nlation therapy is indicated to\nreduce the risk of vision loss\nin individuals with high-risk\nproliferative diabetic retinop-\nathy and, in some cases, se-\nvere nonproliferative diabetic\nretinopathy. A\n12.11 Intravitreous injections of anti\u2013\nvascular endothelial growth\nfactor are a reasonable alter-\nnative to traditional panretinal\nlaser photocoagulation for\nsome individuals with prolifer-\native diabetic retinopathy and\nalso reduce the risk of vision\nloss in these individuals. A\n12.12 Intravitreous injections of anti\u2013\nvascular endothelial growth\nfactor are indicated as \ufb01rst-\nline treatment for most eyes\nwith diabetic macular edema\nthat involves the foveal center\nand impairs vision acuity. A\n12.13 Macular focal/grid photo-\ncoagulation and intravitreal\ninjections of corticosteroid are\nreasonable treatments in eyes\nwith persistent diabetic macu-\nlar edema despite previous\nanti\u2013vascular endothelial growth\nfactor therapy or eyes that\nare not candidates for this\n\ufb01rst-line approach. A\n12.14 The presence of retinopathy\nis not a contraindication to\naspirin therapy for cardiopro-\ntection, as aspirin does not\nincrease the risk of retinal\nhemorrhage. A\nTwo of the main motivations for screen-\ning for diabetic retinopathy are to pre-\nvent loss of vision and to intervene with\ntreatment when vision loss can be pre-\nvented or reversed.\nPhotocoagulation Surgery\nTwo large trials, the Diabetic Retinopa-\nthy Study (DRS) in individuals with PDR\nand the Early Treatment Diabetic Reti-\nnopathy Study (ETDRS) in individuals with\nmacular edema, provide the strongest\nsupport for the therapeutic bene\ufb01ts of\nphotocoagulation surgery. The DRS (25)\nshowed in 1978 that panretinal photo-\ncoagulation surgery reduced the risk of\nsevere vision loss from PDR from 15.9%\nin untreated eyes to 6.4% in treated\neyes with the greatest bene\ufb01t ratio in\nthose with more advanced baseline\ndisease (disc neovascularization or vitre-\nous hemorrhage). In 1985, the ETDRS\nalso veri\ufb01ed the bene\ufb01ts of panretinal\nphotocoagulation for high-risk PDR and\nin older-onset individuals with severe\nnonproliferative diabetic retinopathy\nor less-than-high-risk PDR. Panretinal\nlaser photocoagulation is still commonly\nused to manage complications of dia-\nbetic retinopathy that involve retinal\nneovascularization and its complications.\nA more gentle, macular focal/grid laser\nphotocoagulation technique was shown\nin the ETDRS to be effective in treating\neyes with clinically signi\ufb01cant macular\nedema from diabetes (26), but this is\nnow largely considered to be second-line\ntreatment for diabetic macular edema.\nAnti\u2013Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor\nTreatment\nData from the DRCR Retina Network\n(formerly the Diabetic Retinopathy Clini-\ncal Research Network) and others dem-\nonstrate that intravitreal injections of\nanti-VEGF agents are effective at re-\ngressing proliferative disease and lead\nto noninferior or superior visual acuity\noutcomes compared with panretinal la-\nser over 2 years of follow-up (27,28). In\naddition, it was observed that individuals\ntreated with ranibizumab tended to have\nless peripheral visual \ufb01eld loss, fewer\nvitrectomy surgeries for secondary com-\nplications from their proliferative dis-\nease, and a lower risk of developing\ndiabetic macular edema. However, a\npotential drawback in using anti-VEGF\ntherapy to manage proliferative disease\nis that patients were required to have a\ngreater number of visits and received a\ngreater number of treatments than is\ntypically required for management with\npanretinal laser, which may not be opti-\nmal for some individuals. The FDA has\napproved a\ufb02ibercept and ranibizumab\nfor the treatment of eyes with diabetic\nretinopathy. Other emerging therapies\nfor retinopathy that may use sustained\nintravitreal delivery of pharmacologic\nagents are currently under investigation.\nAnti-VEGF treatment of eyes with non-\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy has\nbeen demonstrated to reduce subse-\nquent development of retinal neovascu-\nlarization and diabetic macular edema\nbut has not been shown to improve\nvisual outcomes over 2 years of therapy\nand therefore is not routinely recom-\nmended for this indication (29).\nWhile the ETDRS (26) established the\nbene\ufb01t of focal laser photocoagulation\nsurgery in eyes with clinically signi\ufb01cant\nmacular edema (de\ufb01ned as retinal edema\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nRetinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care\nS205\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "located at or threatening the macular\ncenter), current data from well-designed\nclinical trials demonstrate that intravi-\ntreal anti-VEGF agents provide a more\neffective treatment plan for center-\ninvolved diabetic macular edema than\nmonotherapy with laser (30,31). Most\npatients require near-monthly adminis-\ntration of intravitreal therapy with anti-\nVEGF agents during the \ufb01rst 12 months\nof treatment, with fewer injections needed\nin subsequent years to maintain remission\nfrom central-involved diabetic macular\nedema. There are currently three anti-\nVEGF agents commonly used to treat eyes\nwith central-involved diabetic macular\nedema\u2014bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and\na\ufb02ibercept (1)\u2014and a comparative effec-\ntiveness study demonstrated that a\ufb02iber-\ncept provides vision outcomes superior\nto those of bevacizumab when eyes have\nmoderate visual impairment (vision of\n20/50 or worse) from diabetic macular\nedema (32). For eyes that have good\nvision (20/25 or better) despite diabetic\nmacular edema, close monitoring with\ninitiation of anti-VEGF therapy if vision\nworsens provides similar 2-year vision\noutcomes compared with immediate initi-\nation of anti-VEGF therapy (33).\nEyes that have persistent diabetic macu-\nlar edema despite anti-VEGF treatment\nmay bene\ufb01t from macular laser photo-\ncoagulation or intravitreal therapy with\ncorticosteroids. Both of these therapies\nare also reasonable \ufb01rst-line approaches\nfor individuals who are not candidates\nfor anti-VEGF treatment due to systemic\nconsiderations such as pregnancy.\nAdjunctive Therapy\nLowering blood pressure has been shown\nto decrease retinopathy progression,\nalthough tight targets (systolic blood\npressure <120 mmHg) do not impart\nadditional bene\ufb01t (8). In individuals with\ndyslipidemia, retinopathy progression\nmay be slowed by the addition of feno-\n\ufb01brate, particularly with very mild non-\nproliferative diabetic retinopathy at\nbaseline (34,35).\nNEUROPATHY\nScreening\nRecommendations\n12.15 All people with diabetes should\nbe assessed for diabetic pe-\nripheral neuropathy starting at\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes\nand 5 years after the diagnosis\nof type 1 diabetes and at least\nannually thereafter. B\n12.16 Assessment for distal symmet-\nric polyneuropathy should in-\nclude a careful history and\nassessment of either tem-\nperature or pinprick sensation\n(small-\ufb01ber function) and vibra-\ntion sensation using a 128-Hz\ntuning fork (for large-\ufb01ber func-\ntion). All people with diabetes\nshould have annual 10-g mono-\n\ufb01lament testing to identify\nfeet at risk for ulceration and\namputation. B\n12.17 Symptoms and signs of auto-\nnomic neuropathy should be\nassessed in people with diabe-\ntes starting at diagnosis of\ntype 2 diabetes and 5 years\nafter the diagnosis of type 1\ndiabetes and at least annu-\nally thereafter and with evi-\ndence of other microvascular\ncomplications, particularly kid-\nney disease and diabetic pe-\nripheral neuropathy. Screening\ncan include asking about or-\nthostatic dizziness, syncope, or\ndry cracked skin in the ex-\ntremities. Signs of autonomic\nneuropathy include orthostatic\nhypotension, a resting tachy-\ncardia, or evidence of pe-\nripheral dryness or cracking\nof skin. E\nDiabetic neuropathies are a heteroge-\nneous group of disorders with diverse\nclinical manifestations. The early rec-\nognition and appropriate management\nof neuropathy in people with diabetes\nis important. Points to be aware of in-\nclude the following:\n1. Diabetic neuropathy is a diagnosis\nof exclusion. Nondiabetic neuropa-\nthies may be present in people with\ndiabetes and may be treatable.\n2. Up to 50% of diabetic peripheral neu-\nropathy may be asymptomatic. If not\nrecognized and if preventive foot care\nis not implemented, people with dia-\nbetes are at risk for injuries as well as\ndiabetic foot ulcers and amputations.\n3. Recognition and treatment of au-\ntonomic neuropathy may improve\nsymptoms, reduce sequelae, and im-\nprove quality of life.\nSpeci\ufb01c treatment to reverse the un-\nderlying nerve damage is currently not\navailable. Glycemic control can effec-\ntively prevent diabetic peripheral neu-\nropathy (DPN) and cardiac autonomic\nneuropathy (CAN) in type 1 diabetes\n(36,37) and may modestly slow their\nprogression in type 2 diabetes (38), but\nit does not reverse neuronal loss. Treat-\nments of other modi\ufb01able risk factors\n(including lipids and blood pressure) can\naid in prevention of DPN progression in\ntype 2 diabetes and may reduce disease\nprogression in type 1 diabetes (39\u201341).\nTherapeutic strategies (pharmacologic and\nnonpharmacologic) for the relief of painful\nDPN and symptoms of autonomic neurop-\nathy can potentially reduce pain (42) and\nimprove quality of life.\nDiagnosis\nDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathy\nIndividuals with a type 1 diabetes dura-\ntion $5 years and all individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes should be assessed an-\nnually for DPN using the medical history\nand simple clinical tests (42). Symptoms\nvary according to the class of sensory \ufb01-\nbers involved. The most common early\nsymptoms are induced by the involve-\nment of small \ufb01bers and include pain\nand dysesthesia (unpleasant sensations\nof burning and tingling). The involve-\nment of large \ufb01bers may cause numb-\nness and loss of protective sensation\n(LOPS). LOPS indicates the presence of\ndistal sensorimotor polyneuropathy and\nis a risk factor for diabetic foot ulceration.\nThe following clinical tests may be used\nto assess small- and large-\ufb01ber func-\ntion and protective sensation:\n1. Small-\ufb01ber function: pinprick and\ntemperature sensation.\n2. Large-\ufb01ber function: lower-extremity\nre\ufb02exes, vibration perception, and\n10-g mono\ufb01lament.\n3. Protective sensation: 10-g mono-\n\ufb01lament.\nThese tests not only screen for the\npresence of dysfunction but also predict\nfuture risk of complications.

    "text": "where the clinical features are atypical\nor the diagnosis is unclear.\nIn all people with diabetes and\nDPN, causes of neuropathy other than\ndiabetes should be considered, including\ntoxins (e.g., alcohol), neurotoxic medica-\ntions (e.g., chemotherapy), vitamin B12\nde\ufb01ciency, hypothyroidism, renal disease,\nmalignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma,\nbronchogenic carcinoma), infections (e.g.,\nHIV), chronic in\ufb02ammatory demyelinating\nneuropathy, inherited neuropathies, and\nvasculitis (43). See the American Diabetes\nAssociation position statement \u201cDiabetic\nNeuropathy\u201d for more details (42).\nDiabetic Autonomic Neuropathy\nIndividuals who have had type 1 diabe-\ntes for $5 years and all individuals with\ntype 2 diabetes should be assessed an-\nnually for autonomic neuropathy (42).\nThe symptoms and signs of autonomic\nneuropathy should be elicited carefully\nduring the history and physical examina-\ntion. Major clinical manifestations of\ndiabetic autonomic neuropathy include\nresting tachycardia, orthostatic hypoten-\nsion, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea,\nfecal incontinence, erectile dysfunction,\nneurogenic bladder, and sudomotor\ndysfunction with either increased or\ndecreased sweating. Screening for symp-\ntoms of autonomic neuropathy includes\nasking about symptoms of orthostatic in-\ntolerance (dizziness, lightheadedness, or\nweakness with standing), syncope, exer-\ncise intolerance, constipation, diarrhea,\nurinary retention, urinary incontinence,\nor changes in sweat function. Further\ntesting can be considered if symptoms\nare present and will depend on the end\norgan involved but might include cardio-\nvascular autonomic testing, sweat testing,\nurodynamic studies, gastric emptying, or\nendoscopy/colonoscopy. Impaired coun-\nterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia\nin type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to\nhypoglycemia unawareness but are not\ndirectly linked to autonomic neuropathy.\nCardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy. CAN\nis associated with mortality independently\nof other cardiovascular risk factors (44,45).\nIn its early stages, CAN may be completely\nasymptomatic and detected only by\ndecreased heart rate variability with\ndeep breathing. Advanced disease may\nbe associated with resting tachycardia\n(>100 bpm) and orthostatic hypoten-\nsion (a fall in systolic or diastolic blood\npressure by >20 mmHg or >10 mmHg,\nrespectively, upon standing without an\nappropriate increase in heart rate). CAN\ntreatment is generally focused on allevi-\nating symptoms.\nGastrointestinal Neuropathies. Gastrointes-\ntinal neuropathies may involve any por-\ntion of the gastrointestinal tract, with\nmanifestations including esophageal\ndysmotility, gastroparesis, constipation,\ndiarrhea, and fecal incontinence. Gastro-\nparesis should be suspected in individu-\nals with erratic glycemic control or with\nupper gastrointestinal symptoms with-\nout another identi\ufb01ed cause. Exclusion of\nreversible/iatrogenic causes such as medi-\ncations or organic causes of gastric outlet\nobstruction or peptic ulcer disease (with\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy or a barium\nstudy of the stomach) is needed before\nconsidering a diagnosis of or specialized\ntesting for gastroparesis. The diagnostic\ngold standard for gastroparesis is the\nmeasurement of gastric emptying with\nscintigraphy of digestible solids at 15-min\nintervals for 4 h after food intake. The use\nof 13C octanoic acid breath test is an ap-\nproved alternative.\nGenitourinary Disturbances. Diabetic auto-\nnomic neuropathy may also cause geni-\ntourinary disturbances, including sexual\ndysfunction and bladder dysfunction.\nIn men, diabetic autonomic neuropathy\nmay cause erectile dysfunction and/or\nretrograde ejaculation (42). Female sex-\nual dysfunction occurs more frequently\nin those with diabetes and presents as\ndecreased sexual desire, increased pain\nduring intercourse, decreased sexual\narousal, and inadequate lubrication (46).\nLower urinary tract symptoms manifest\nas urinary incontinence and bladder dys-\nfunction (nocturia, frequent urination,\nurination urgency, and weak urinary\nstream). Evaluation of bladder func-\ntion should be performed for individuals\nwith diabetes who have recurrent uri-\nnary tract infections, pyelonephritis, in-\ncontinence, or a palpable bladder.\nTreatment\nRecommendations\n12.18 Optimize glucose control to\nprevent or delay the develop-\nment of neuropathy in people\nwith type 1 diabetes A and\nto slow the progression of\nneuropathy in people with\ntype 2 diabetes. C Optimize\nblood pressure and serum lipid\ncontrol to reduce the risk or\nslow the progression of dia-\nbetic neuropathy. B\n12.19 Assess and treat pain related\nto diabetic peripheral neu-\nropathy B and symptoms of\nautonomic neuropathy to im-\nprove quality of life. E\n12.20 Gabapentinoids, serotonin-\nnorepinephrine reuptake inhib-\nitors, tricyclic antidepressants,\nand sodium channel blockers\nare recommended as initial\npharmacologic treatments for\nneuropathic pain in diabetes.\nA Refer to neurologist or pain\nspecialist when pain control\nis not achieved within the scope\nof practice of the treating\nphysician. E\nGlycemic Control\nNear-normal glycemic control, imple-\nmented early in the course of diabetes,\nhas been shown to effectively delay or\nprevent the development of DPN and\nCAN in people with type 1 diabetes\n(47\u201350). Although the evidence for the\nbene\ufb01t of near-normal glycemic control\nis not as strong that for type 2 diabetes,\nsome studies have demonstrated a mod-\nest slowing of progression without rever-\nsal of neuronal loss (38,51). Speci\ufb01c\nglucose-lowering strategies may have dif-\nferent effects. In a post hoc analysis, par-\nticipants, particularly men, in the Bypass\nAngioplasty Revascularization Investigation\nin Type 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial treated\nwith insulin sensitizers had a lower inci-\ndence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy\nover 4 years than those treated with insu-\nlin/sulfonylurea (52). Additionally, recent\nevidence from the Action to Control Car-\ndiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial\nshowed clear bene\ufb01t of intensive glucose\nand blood pressure control on the preven-\ntion of CAN in type 2 diabetes (53).\nLipid Control\nDyslipidemia is a key factor in the\ndevelopment of neuropathy in people\nwith type 2 diabetes and may contrib-\nute to neuropathy risk in people with\ntype 1 diabetes (54,55).

    "text": "and neuropathy development has be-\ncome increasingly clear in type 2 diabe-\ntes, the optimal therapeutic intervention\nhas not been identi\ufb01ed. Positive effects\nof physical activity, weight loss, and bar-\niatric surgery have been reported in indi-\nviduals with DPN, but use of conventional\nlipid-lowering pharmacotherapy (such as\nstatins or feno\ufb01brates) does not appear\nto be effective in treating or preventing\nDPN development (56).\nBlood Pressure Control\nThere are multiple reasons for blood\npressure control in people with diabetes,\nbut neuropathy progression (especially\nin type 2 diabetes) has now been added\nto this list. Although data from many\nstudies have supported the role of hy-\npertension in risk of neuropathy devel-\nopment, a recent meta-analysis of data\nfrom 14 countries in the International\nPrevalence and Treatment of Diabetes\nand Depression (INTERPRET-DD) study re-\nvealed hypertension as an independent\nrisk of DPN development with an odds\nratio of 1.58 (57). In the ACCORD trial,\nintensive blood pressure intervention\ndecreased CAN risk by 25% (53).\nNeuropathic Pain\nNeuropathic pain can be severe and can\nimpact quality of life, limit mobility, and\ncontribute to depression and social dys-\nfunction (58). No compelling evidence\nexists in support of glycemic control or\nlifestyle management as therapies for\nneuropathic pain in diabetes or predia-\nbetes, which leaves only pharmaceutical\ninterventions (59). A recent guideline by\nthe American Academy of Neurology rec-\nommends that the initial treatment of\npain should also focus on the concurrent\ntreatment of both sleep and mood dis-\norders because of increased frequency\nof these problems in individuals with\nDPN (60).\nA number of pharmacologic therapies\nexist for treatment of pain in diabetes.\nThe American Academy of Neurology\nupdate suggested that gabapentinoids,\nserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-\ntors (SNRIs), sodium channel blockers,\ntricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and SNRI/\nopioid dual-mechanism agents could all\nbe considered in the treatment of pain in\nDPN (60). These American Academy of\nNeurology recommendations offer a sup-\nplement to a recent American Diabetes\nAssociation pain monograph, although\nsome areas of disagreement exist, particu-\nlarly around SNRI/opioid dual-mechanism\nagents (61). A recent head-to-head trial\nsuggested therapeutic equivalency for\nTCAs, SNRIs, and gabapentinoids in the\ntreatment of pain in DPN (62). The trial\nalso supported the role of combination\ntherapy over monotherapy for the treat-\nment of pain in DPN.\nGabapentinoids. Gabapentinoids include\nseveral calcium channel a2-d subunit li-\ngands. Eight high-quality studies and seven\nmedium-quality studies support the role of\npregabalin in treatment of pain in DPN.\nOne high-quality study and many small\nstudies support the role of gabapentin\nin the treatment of pain in DPN. Two\nmedium-quality studies suggest that micro-\ngabalin has a small effect on pain in DPN\n(60). Adverse effects may be more severe\nin older individuals (63) and may be at-\ntenuated by lower starting doses and\nmore gradual titration.\nSNRIs. SNRIs include duloxetine, venla-\nfaxine, and desvenlafaxine, all selective\nSNRIs. Two high-quality studies and \ufb01ve\nmedium-quality studies support the role\nof duloxetine in the treatment of pain in\nDPN. A high-quality study supports the role\nof venlafaxine in the treatment of pain in\nDPN. Only one medium-quality study sup-\nports a possible role for desvenlafaxine for\ntreatment of pain in DPN (60). Adverse\nevents may be more severe in older peo-\nple but may be attenuated with lower\ndoses and slower titration of duloxetine.\nTapentadol and Tramadol. Tapentadol and\ntramadol are centrally acting opioid anal-\ngesics that exert their analgesic effects\nthrough both m-opioid receptor agonism\nand norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake\ninhibition. SNRI/opioid agents are probably\neffective in the treatment of pain in DPN.\nHowever, the use of any opioids for man-\nagement of chronic neuropathic pain carries\nthe risk of addiction and should be avoided.\nTricyclic Antidepressants. Tricyclic anti-\ndepressants have been studied for treat-\nment of pain, and most of the relevant\ndata was acquired from trials of ami-\ntriptyline and include two high-quality\nstudies and two medium-quality stud-\nies supporting the treatment of pain in\nDPN (60,62). Anticholinergic side effects\nmay be dose limiting and restrict use in\nindividuals $65 years of age.\nSodium Channel Blockers. Sodium channel\nblockers include lamotrigine, lacosamide,\noxcarbazepine, and valproic acid. Five\nmedium-quality studies support the role\nof sodium channel blockers in treating\npain in DPN (60).\nCapsaicin. Capsaicin has received FDA ap-\nproval for treatment of pain in DPN using\nan 8% patch, with one high-quality study\nreported. One medium-quality study of\n0.075% capsaicin cream has been re-\nported. In patients with contraindica-\ntions to oral pharmacotherapy or who\nprefer topical treatments, the use of\ntopical capsaicin can be considered.\nCarbamazepine and a-Lipoic Acid. Carba-\nmazepine and a-lipoic acid, although not\napproved for the treatment of painful\nDPN, may be effective and considered for\nthe treatment of painful DPN (41,54,56).\nOrthostatic Hypotension\nTreating orthostatic hypotension is chal-\nlenging. The therapeutic goal is to mini-\nmize postural symptoms rather than to\nrestore normotension. Most patients re-\nquire both nonpharmacologic measures\n(e.g., ensuring adequate salt intake, avoid-\ning medications that aggravate hypoten-\nsion, or using compressive garments over\nthe legs and abdomen) and pharmaco-\nlogic measures. Physical activity and ex-\nercise should be encouraged to avoid\ndeconditioning, which is known to ex-\nacerbate orthostatic intolerance, and\nvolume repletion with \ufb02uids and salt\nis critical. There have been clinical studies\nthat assessed the impact of an approach\nincorporating the aforementioned non-\npharmacologic measures. Additionally,\nsupine blood pressure tends to be much\nhigher in these individuals, often requir-\ning treatment of blood pressure at bed-\ntime with shorter-acting drugs that also\naffect baroreceptor activity such as guan-\nfacine or clonidine, shorter-acting calcium\nblockers (e.g., isradipine), or shorter-\nacting b-blockers such as atenolol or\nmetoprolol tartrate. Alternatives can in-\nclude enalapril if an individual is unable\nto tolerate preferred agents (64\u201366).\nMidodrine and droxidopa are approved\nby the FDA for the treatment of ortho-\nstatic hypotension.\nGastroparesis\nTreatment for diabetic gastroparesis may\nbe very challenging. A low-\ufb01ber, low-fat\neating plan provided in small frequent\nmeals with a greater proportion of liquid\ncalories may be useful (67\u201369).

How-\never, the risk of removal of GLP-1 RAs\nshould be balanced against their potential\nbene\ufb01ts. In cases of severe gastroparesis,\npharmacologic interventions are needed.\nOnly metoclopramide, a prokinetic agent,\nis approved by the FDA for the treatment\nof gastroparesis. However, the level of\nevidence regarding the bene\ufb01ts of meto-\nclopramide for the management of gas-\ntroparesis is weak, and given the risk for\nserious adverse effects (extrapyramidal\nsigns such as acute dystonic reactions,\ndrug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, and\ntardive dyskinesia), its use in the treat-\nment of gastroparesis beyond 12 weeks\nis no longer recommended by the FDA.\nIt should be reserved for severe cases\nthat are unresponsive to other thera-\npies (71). Other treatment options in-\nclude domperidone (available outside\nthe U.S.) and erythromycin, which is only\neffective for short-term use due to tachy-\nphylaxis (72,73). Gastric electrical stimula-\ntion using a surgically implantable device\nhas received approval from the FDA,\nalthough its ef\ufb01cacy is variable and use is\nlimited to individuals with severe symp-\ntoms that are refractory to other treat-\nments (74).\nErectile Dysfunction\nIn addition to treatment of hypogonadism\nif present, treatments for erectile dys-\nfunction may include phosphodiester-\nase type 5 inhibitors, intracorporeal or\nintraurethral prostaglandins, vacuum\ndevices, or penile prostheses. As with\nDPN treatments, these interventions\ndo not change the underlying pathol-\nogy and natural history of the disease\nprocess but may improve a person\u2019s qual-\nity of life.\nFOOT CARE\nRecommendations\n12.21 Perform a comprehensive foot\nevaluation at least annually to\nidentify risk factors for ulcers\nand amputations. A\n12.22 The examination should in-\nclude inspection of the skin,\nassessment of foot deformi-\nties, neurological assessment\n(10-g mono\ufb01lament testing with\nat least one other assessment:\npinprick, temperature, vibra-\ntion), and vascular assess-\nment, including pulses in the\nlegs and feet. B\n12.23 Individuals with evidence of\nsensory loss or prior ulceration\nor amputation should have\ntheir feet inspected at every\nvisit. A\n12.24 Obtain a prior history of ul-\nceration, amputation, Charcot\nfoot, angioplasty or vascular\nsurgery, cigarette smoking,\nretinopathy, and renal disease\nand assess current symptoms\nof neuropathy (pain, burning,\nnumbness) and vascular disease\n(leg fatigue, claudication). B\n12.25 Initial screening for peripheral\narterial disease should include\nassessment of lower-extremity\npulses, capillary re\ufb01ll time, ru-\nbor on dependency, pallor on\nelevation, and venous \ufb01lling\ntime. Individuals with a his-\ntory of leg fatigue, claudica-\ntion, and rest pain relieved\nwith dependency or decreased\nor absent pedal pulses should\nbe referred for ankle\u2013brachial\nindex and for further vascular\nassessment as appropriate. B\n12.26 A multidisciplinary approach is\nrecommended for individuals\nwith foot ulcers and high-risk\nfeet (e.g., those on dialysis,\nthose with Charcot foot, those\nwith a history of prior ulcers\nor amputation, and those with\nperipheral arterial disease). B\n12.27 Refer individuals who smoke\nand have a history of prior\nlower-extremity complications,\nloss of protective sensation,\nstructural\nabnormalities,\nor\nperipheral arterial disease to\nfoot care specialists for on-\ngoing preventive care and\nlifelong surveillance. B\n12.28 Provide general preventive foot\nself-care education to all peo-\nple with diabetes, including\nthose with loss of protective\nsensation, on appropriate ways\nto examine their feet (palpa-\ntion or visual inspection with\nan unbreakable mirror) for\ndaily surveillance of early foot\nproblems. B\n12.29 The use of specialized ther-\napeutic footwear is recom-\nmended for people with\ndiabetes at high risk for ul-\nceration, including those with\nloss of protective sensation,\nfoot deformities, ulcers, cal-\nlous formation, poor periph-\neral circulation, or history of\namputation. B\n12.30 For chronic diabetic foot ul-\ncers that have failed to heal\nwith optimal standard care\nalone, adjunctive treatment\nwith randomized controlled\ntrial\u2013proven advanced agents\nshould be considered. Con-\nsiderations might include\nnegative-pressure wound ther-\napy, placental membranes, bi-\noengineered skin substitutes,\nseveral acellular matrices, au-\ntologous \ufb01brin and leukocyte\nplatelet patches, and topical\noxygen therapy. A\nFoot ulcerations and amputations are\ncommon complications associated with\ndiabetes. These may be the consequences\nof several factors, including peripheral\nneuropathy, peripheral arterial disease\n(PAD), and foot deformities. They rep-\nresent major causes of morbidity and\nmortality in people with diabetes. Early\nrecognition of at-risk feet, preulcerative\nlesions, and prompt treatment of ulcer-\nations and other lower-extremity com-\nplications can delay or prevent adverse\noutcomes.\nEarly recognition requires an under-\nstanding of those factors that put peo-\nple with diabetes at increased risk for\nulcerations and amputations.

    "text": "Identifying the at-risk foot begins with\na detailed history documenting diabetes\ncontrol, smoking history, exercise toler-\nance, history of claudication or rest pain,\nand prior ulcerations or amputations. A\nthorough examination of the feet should\nbe performed annually in all people with\ndiabetes and more frequently in at-risk\nindividuals (75). The examination should\ninclude assessment of skin integrity, as-\nsessment for LOPS using the 10-g mono-\n\ufb01lament along with at least one other\nneurological assessment tool, pulse ex-\namination of the dorsalis pedis and pos-\nterior tibial arteries, and assessment for\nfoot deformities such as bunions, ham-\nmertoes, and prominent metatarsals,\nwhich increase plantar foot pressures\nand increase risk for ulcerations. At-risk\nindividuals should be assessed at each\nvisit and should be referred to foot care\nspecialists for ongoing preventive care\nand surveillance. The physical examina-\ntion can stratify patients into different\ncategories and determine the frequency\nof these visits (76) (Table 12.1).\nEvaluation for Loss of Protective\nSensation\nThe presence of peripheral sensory neu-\nropathy is the single most common com-\nponent cause for foot ulceration. In a\nmulticenter trial, peripheral neuropathy\nwas found to be a component cause in\n78% of people with diabetes with ulcer-\nations and that the triad of peripheral\nsensory neuropathy, minor trauma, and\nfoot deformity was present in >63%\nof participants (77). All people with dia-\nbetes should undergo a comprehensive\nfoot examination at least annually, or\nmore frequently for those in higher-risk\ncategories (75,76).\nLOPS is vital to risk assessment. One\nof the most useful tests to determine\nLOPS is the 10-g mono\ufb01lament test.\nStudies have shown that clinical exami-\nnation and the 10-g mono\ufb01lament test\nare the two most sensitive tests in iden-\ntifying the foot at risk for ulceration\n(78). The mono\ufb01lament test should be\nperformed with at least one other neu-\nrologic assessment tool (e.g., pinprick,\ntemperature perception, ankle re\ufb02exes,\nor vibratory perception with a 128-Hz\ntuning fork or similar device). Absent\nmono\ufb01lament sensation and one other\nabnormal test con\ufb01rms the presence of\nLOPS. Further neurological testing, such\nas nerve conduction, electromyography,\nnerve biopsy, or intraepidermal nerve \ufb01-\nber density biopsies, are rarely indicated\nfor the diagnosis of peripheral sensory\nneuropathy (42).\nEvaluation for Peripheral Arterial\nDisease\nInitial screening for PAD should include\na history of leg fatigue, claudication,\nand rest pain relieved with dependency.\nPhysical examination for PAD should\ninclude assessment of lower-extremity\npulses, capillary re\ufb01ll time, rubor on\ndependency, pallor on elevation, and ve-\nnous \ufb01lling time (75,79). Any patient ex-\nhibiting signs and symptoms of PAD\nshould be referred for noninvasive arte-\nrial studies in the form of Doppler ultra-\nsound with pulse volume recordings.\nWhile ankle\u2013brachial indices will be\ncalculated, they should be interpreted\ncarefully, as they are known to be inac-\ncurate in people with diabetes due to\nnoncompressible vessels. Toe systolic blood\npressure tends to be more accurate. Toe\nsystolic blood pressures <30 mmHg are\nsuggestive of PAD and an inability to\nheal foot ulcerations (80). Individuals with\nabnormal pulse volume recording tracings\nand toe pressures <30 mmHg with foot\nulcers should be referred for immediate\nvascular evaluation. Due to the high\nprevalence of PAD in people with dia-\nbetes, it has been recommended by the\nSociety for Vascular Surgery and the\nAmerican Podiatric Medical Associa-\ntion in their 2016 guidelines that all\npeople with diabetes >50 years of age\nshould undergo screening via noninva-\nsive arterial studies (79,81). If nor-\nmal, these should be repeated every\n5 years (79).\nPatient Education\nAll people with diabetes (and their\nfamilies), particularly those with the\naforementioned high-risk conditions,\nshould receive general foot care edu-\ncation, including appropriate manage-\nment strategies (82\u201384). This education\nshould be provided to all newly diag-\nnosed people with diabetes as part of an\nannual comprehensive examination and\nto individuals with high-risk conditions at\nevery visit. Recent studies have shown\nthat while education improves knowl-\nedge of diabetic foot problems and self-\ncare of the foot, it does not improve\nbehaviors associated with active participa-\ntion in their overall diabetes care and to\nachieve personal health goals (85). Evi-\ndence also suggests that while patient\nand family education are important, the\nknowledge is quickly forgotten and needs\nto be reinforced regularly (86).\nTable 12.1\u2014International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot risk strati\ufb01cation system and corresponding foot screening\nfrequency\nCategory\nUlcer risk\nCharacteristics\nExamination frequency*\n0\nVery low\nNo LOPS and No PAD\nAnnually\n1\nLow\nLOPS or PAD\nEvery 6\u201312 months\n2\nModerate\nLOPS 1 PAD, or\nLOPS 1 foot deformity, or\nPAD 1 foot deformity\nEvery 3\u20136 months\n3\nHigh\nLOPS or PAD and one or more of the following:\n\u0001 History of foot ulcer\n\u0001 Amputation (minor or major)\n\u0001 End-stage renal disease\nEvery 1\u20133 months\nAdapted with permission from Schaper et al.

    "text": "Individuals considered at risk should\nunderstand the implications of foot de-\nformities, LOPS, and PAD; the proper\ncare of the foot, including nail and skin\ncare; and the importance of foot inspec-\ntions on a daily basis. Individuals with\nLOPS should be educated on appropriate\nways to examine their feet (palpation or\nvisual inspection with an unbreakable\nmirror) for daily surveillance of early\nfoot problems. Patients should also be\neducated on the importance of refer-\nrals to foot care specialists. A recent\nstudy showed that people with diabetes\nand foot disease lacked awareness of\ntheir risk status and why they were be-\ning referred to a multidisciplinary team\nof foot care specialists. Further, they ex-\nhibited a variable degree of interest in\nlearning further about foot complica-\ntions (87).\nPatients\u2019 understanding of these issues\nand their physical ability to conduct proper\nfoot surveillance and care should be as-\nsessed. Those with visual dif\ufb01culties, physi-\ncal constraints preventing movement, or\ncognitive problems that impair their\nability to assess the condition of the\nfoot and to institute appropriate responses\nwill need other people, such as family\nmembers, to assist with their care.\nThe selection of appropriate footwear\nand footwear behaviors at home should\nalso be discussed (e.g., no walking\nbarefoot, avoiding open-toed shoes).\nTherapeutic footwear with custom-made\northotic devices have been shown to re-\nduce peak plantar pressures (84). Most\nstudies use reduction in peak plantar\npressures as an outcome as opposed to\nulcer prevention. Certain design features\nof the orthoses, such as rocker soles and\nmetatarsal accommodations, can reduce\npeak plantar pressures more signi\ufb01cantly\nthan insoles alone. A systematic review,\nhowever, showed there was no signi\ufb01-\ncant reduction in ulcer incidence after\n18 months compared with standard\ninsoles and extra-depth shoes. Fur-\nther, it was also noted that evidence\nto prevent \ufb01rst ulcerations was non-\nexistent (88).\nTreatment\nTreatment recommendations for people\nwith diabetes will be determined by\ntheir risk category. No-risk or low-risk\nindividuals can often be managed with\neducation and self-care. People in the\nmoderate- to high-risk category should\nbe referred to foot care specialists for\nfurther evaluation and regular surveil-\nlance as outlined in Table 12.1. This in-\ncludes individuals with LOPS, PAD, and/\nor structural foot deformities, such as\nCharcot foot, bunions, or hammertoes.\nIndividuals with any open ulceration or\nunexplained swelling, erythema, or in-\ncreased skin temperature should be re-\nferred urgently to a foot care specialist\nor multidisciplinary team.\nInitial treatment recommendations\nshould include daily foot inspection,\nuse of moisturizers for dry, scaly skin,\nand avoidance of self-care of ingrown\nnails and calluses. Well-\ufb01tted athletic or\nwalking shoes with customized pressure-\nrelieving orthoses should be part of ini-\ntial recommendations for people with\nincreased plantar pressures (as demon-\nstrated by plantar calluses). Individuals\nwith deformities such as bunions or\nhammertoes may require specialized\nfootwear such as extra-depth shoes.\nThose with even more signi\ufb01cant de-\nformities, as in Charcot joint disease,\nmay require custom-made footwear.\nSpecial consideration should be given\nto individuals with neuropathy who pre-\nsent with a warm, swollen, red foot\nwith or without a history of trauma and\nwithout an open ulceration. These indi-\nviduals require a thorough workup for\npossible Charcot neuroarthropathy (89).\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of this\ncondition is of paramount importance\nin preventing deformities and instability\nthat can lead to ulceration and amputa-\ntion. These individuals require total non\u2013\nweight-bearing and urgent referral to a\nfoot care specialist for further manage-\nment. Foot and ankle X-rays should be\nperformed in all individuals presenting\nwith the above clinical \ufb01ndings.\nThere have been a number of devel-\nopments in the treatment of ulcerations\nover the years (90). These include\nnegative-pressure therapy, growth fac-\ntors, bioengineered tissue, acellular ma-\ntrix tissue, stem cell therapy, hyperbaric\noxygen therapy, and, most recently, topi-\ncal oxygen therapy (91\u201393). While there\nis literature to support many modalities\ncurrently used to treat diabetic foot\nwounds, robust randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) are often lacking. How-\never, it is agreed that the initial treat-\nment and evaluation of ulcerations\ninclude the following \ufb01ve basic prin-\nciples of ulcer treatment:\n\u2022 Of\ufb02oading of plantar ulcerations\n\u2022 Debridement of necrotic, nonviable\ntissue\n\u2022 Revascularization of ischemic wounds\nwhen necessary\n\u2022 Management of infection: soft tissue\nor bone\n\u2022 Use of physiologic, topical dressings\nHowever, despite following the above\nprinciples, some ulcerations will become\nchronic and fail to heal. In those situa-\ntions, advanced wound therapy can\nplay a role. When to employ advanced\nwound therapy has been the subject of\nmuch discussion, as the therapy is often\nquite expensive. It has been determined\nthat if a wound fails to show a reduc-\ntion of 50% or more after 4 weeks of\nappropriate wound management (i.e.,\nthe \ufb01ve basic principles above), consid-\neration should be given to the use of\nadvanced wound therapy (94). Treat-\nment of these chronic wounds is best\nmanaged in a multidisciplinary setting.\nEvidence to support advanced wound\ntherapy is challenging to produce and\nto assess. Randomization of trial partici-\npants is dif\ufb01cult, as there are many\nvariables that can affect wound heal-\ning. In addition, many RCTs exclude\ncertain cohorts of people, e.g., individu-\nals with chronic renal disease or those on\ndialysis. Finally, blinding of participants\nand clinicians is not always possible.\nMeta-analyses and systematic reviews of\nobservational studies are used to deter-\nmine the clinical effectiveness of these\nmodalities. Such studies can augment for-\nmal RCTs by including a greater variety of\nparticipants in various clinical settings\nwho are typically excluded from the\nmore rigidly structured clinical trials.\nAdvanced wound therapy can be cat-\negorized into nine broad categories (90)\n(Table 12.2). Topical growth factors, acel-\nlular matrix tissues, and bioengineered\ncellular therapies are commonly em-\nployed in of\ufb01ces and wound care cen-\nters to expedite healing of chronic, more\nsuper\ufb01cial ulcerations. Numerous clinical\nreports and retrospective studies have\ndemonstrated the clinical effectiveness\nof each of these modalities. Over the\nyears, there has been increased evidence\nto support the use of these modalities.\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nRetinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care\nS211\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "Nonetheless, use of those products\nor agents with robust RCTs or system-\natic reviews should generally be pre-\nferred over those without level 1 evidence\n(Table 12.2).\nNegative-pressure wound therapy was\n\ufb01rst introduced in the early to mid-\n1990s. It has become especially useful\nin wound preparation for skin grafts\nand \ufb02aps and assists in the closure of\ndeep, large wounds (95,96). A variety of\ntypes exist in the marketplace and range\nfrom electrically powered to mechanically\npowered in different sizes depending\nupon the speci\ufb01c wound requirements.\nElectrical stimulation, pulsed radio-\nfrequency energy, and extracorporeal\nshockwave therapy are biophysical mo-\ndalities that are believed to upregulate\ngrowth factors or cytokines to stimulate\nwound healing, while low-frequency non-\ncontact ultrasound is used to debride\nwounds. However, most of the studies\nadvocating the use of these modalities\nhave been retrospective observational\nor poor-quality RCTs.\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy is the de-\nlivery of oxygen through a chamber, ei-\nther individual or multiperson, with the\nintention of increasing tissue oxygena-\ntion to increase tissue perfusion and\nneovascularization, combat resistant bac-\nteria, and stimulate wound healing. While\nthere had been great interest in this\nmodality being able to expedite healing\nof chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs),\nthere has only been one positive RCT\npublished in the last decade that re-\nported increased healing rates at 9\nand 12 months compared with control\nsubjects (97). More recent studies with\nsigni\ufb01cant design de\ufb01ciencies and par-\nticipant dropouts have failed to provide\ncorroborating evidence that hyperbaric\noxygen therapy should be widely used\nfor managing nonhealing DFUs (98,99).\nWhile there may be some bene\ufb01t in\nprevention of amputation in selected\nchronic neuroischemic ulcers, recent stud-\nies have shown no bene\ufb01t in healing\nDFUs in the absence of ischemia and/\nor infection (93,100).\nTopical oxygen therapy has been\nstudied rather vigorously in recent years,\nwith several high-quality RCTs and at\nleast \ufb01ve systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses all supporting its ef\ufb01cacy in\nhealing chronic DFUs at 12 weeks\n(19,20,30\u201334,91,92,101\u2013105). Three\ntypes of topical oxygen devices are\navailable, including continuous-delivery,\nlow-constant-pressure, and cyclical-\npressure modalities. Importantly, topical\noxygen therapy devices provide for\nhome-based therapy rather than the\nneed for daily visits to specialized cen-\nters. Very high participation with very\nfew reported adverse events combined\nwith improved healing rates makes this\ntherapy another attractive option for ad-\nvanced wound care.\nIf DFUs fail to heal despite appropriate\nwound care, adjunctive advanced thera-\npies should be instituted and are best\nmanaged in a multidisciplinary manner.\nOnce healed, all individuals should be\nenrolled in a formal comprehensive\nprevention program focused on reducing\nthe incidence of recurrent ulcerations and\nsubsequent amputations (75,106,107).\nReferences\n1.

Gabbay,\non behalf of the American Diabetes\nAssociation\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) \u201cStandards of Care in Diabetes\u201d in-\ncludes the ADA\u2019s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to\nprovide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guide-\nlines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional\nPractice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for up-\ndating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a de-\ntailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the\nevidence-grading system for ADA\u2019s clinical practice recommendations and a full\nlist of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction\nand Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are\ninvited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.\nRecommendations\n13.1\nConsider the assessment of medical, psychological, functional (self-\nmanagement abilities), and social domains in older adults to provide\na framework to determine targets and therapeutic approaches for dia-\nbetes management. B\n13.2\nScreen for geriatric syndromes (i.e., polypharmacy, cognitive impairment,\ndepression, urinary incontinence, falls, persistent pain, and frailty) in older\nadults, as they may affect diabetes self-management and diminish quality\nof life. B\nDiabetes is a highly prevalent health condition in the aging population. Over one-\nquarter of people over the age of 65 years have diabetes, and one-half of older\nadults have prediabetes (1,2), and the number of older adults living with these con-\nditions is expected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. Diabetes in older\nadults is also a highly heterogeneous condition. While type 2 diabetes predomi-\nnates in the older population as much as in the younger population, improvements\nin insulin delivery, technology, and care over the last few decades have led to in-\ncreasing numbers of people with childhood and adult-onset type 1 diabetes surviv-\ning and thriving into their later decades. Diabetes management in older adults\nrequires regular assessment of medical, psychological, functional, and social do-\nmains. When assessing older adults with diabetes, it is important to accurately cat-\negorize the type of diabetes as well as other factors, including diabetes duration,\nthe presence of complications, and treatment-related concerns, such as fear of hy-\npoglycemia. Screening for diabetes complications in older adults should be individu-\nalized and periodically revisited, as the results of screening tests may impact\ntargets and therapeutic approaches (3\u20135). Older adults with diabetes have higher\nrates of premature death, functional disability, accelerated muscle loss, and coexist-\ning illnesses, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke, than those\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G, Aroda\nVR, et al., American Diabetes Association. 13.\nOlder adults: Standards of Care in Diabetes\u2014\n2023.

At the same time,\nolder adults with diabetes are also at\ngreater risk than other older adults for\nseveral common geriatric syndromes,\nsuch as polypharmacy, cognitive impair-\nment, depression, urinary incontinence,\ninjurious falls, persistent pain, and frailty\n(1). These conditions may impact older\nadults\u2019 diabetes self-management abili-\nties and quality of life if left unaddressed\n(2,6,7). See Section 4, \u201cComprehensive\nMedical Evaluation and Assessment of\nComorbidities,\u201d for the full range of is-\nsues to consider when caring for older\nadults with diabetes.\nThe comprehensive assessment de-\nscribed above may provide a framework\nto determine targets and therapeutic\napproaches (8\u201310), including whether\nreferral for diabetes self-management\neducation is appropriate (when compli-\ncating factors arise or when transitions\nin care occur) or whether the current\nplan is too complex for the individual\u2019s\nself-management ability or the care-\ngivers providing care (11). Particular atten-\ntion should be paid to complications that\ncan develop over short periods of time\nand/or would signi\ufb01cantly impair func-\ntional status, such as visual and lower-\nextremity complications. Please refer to the\nAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA) con-\nsensus report \u201cDiabetes in Older Adults\u201d\nfor details (3).\nNEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION\nRecommendation\n13.3\nScreening for early detection\nof mild cognitive impairment\nor dementia should be per-\nformed for adults 65 years\nof age or older at the ini-\ntial visit, annually, and as\nappropriate. B\nOlder adults with diabetes are at higher\nrisk of cognitive decline and institution-\nalization (12,13). The presentation of\ncognitive impairment ranges from sub-\ntle executive dysfunction to memory\nloss and overt dementia. People with di-\nabetes have higher incidences of all-\ncause dementia, Alzheimer disease, and\nvascular dementia than people with nor-\nmal glucose tolerance (14). The effects\nof hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hy-\nperinsulinemia on the brain are areas of\nintense research. Poor glycemic control\nis associated with a decline in cognitive\nfunction (15,16), and longer duration of\ndiabetes is associated with worsening cog-\nnitive function. There are ongoing studies\nevaluating whether preventing or delay-\ning diabetes onset may help to maintain\ncognitive function in older adults. How-\never, studies examining the effects of\nintensive glycemic and blood pressure con-\ntrol to achieve speci\ufb01c targets have not\ndemonstrated a reduction in brain function\ndecline (17,18).\nClinical trials of speci\ufb01c interventions\u2014\nincluding cholinesterase inhibitors and\nglutamatergic antagonists\u2014have not shown\npositive therapeutic bene\ufb01t in maintain-\ning or signi\ufb01cantly improving cognitive\nfunction or in preventing cognitive de-\ncline (19). Pilot studies in individuals\nwith mild cognitive impairment evaluat-\ning the potential bene\ufb01ts of intranasal\ninsulin therapy and metformin therapy\nprovide insights for future clinical trials\nand mechanistic studies (20\u201323).\nDespite the paucity of therapies to\nprevent or remedy cognitive decline,\nidentifying cognitive impairment early\nhas important implications for diabetes\ncare. The presence of cognitive impair-\nment can make it challenging for clinicians\nto help their patients reach individualized\nglycemic, blood pressure, and lipid tar-\ngets. Cognitive dysfunction makes it dif\ufb01-\ncult for individuals to perform complex\nself-care tasks (24), such as monitoring\nglucose and adjusting insulin doses. It\nalso hinders their ability to appropriately\nmaintain the timing of meals and content\nof the diet. When clinicians are providing\ncare for people with cognitive dysfunc-\ntion, it is critical to simplify care plans and\nto facilitate and engage the appropriate\nsupport structure to assist individuals in\nall aspects of care.\nOlder adults with diabetes should be\ncarefully screened and monitored for\ncognitive impairment (2). Several simple\nassessment tools are available to screen\nfor cognitive impairment (24,25), such\nas the Mini-Mental State Examination\n(26), Mini-Cog (27), and the Montreal\nCognitive Assessment (28), which may\nhelp to identify individuals requiring\nneuropsychological evaluation, particu-\nlarly those in whom dementia is sus-\npected (i.e., experiencing memory loss\nand decline in their basic and instru-\nmental activities of daily living). Annual\nscreening is indicated for adults 65 years\nof age or older for early detection of\nmild cognitive impairment or dementia\n(4,29). Screening for cognitive impairment\nshould additionally be considered when\nan individual presents with a signi\ufb01cant\ndecline in clinical status due to increased\nproblems with self-care activities, such as\nerrors in calculating insulin dose, dif\ufb01culty\ncounting carbohydrates, skipped meals,\nskipped insulin doses, and dif\ufb01culty rec-\nognizing, preventing, or treating hypo-\nglycemia. People who screen positive\nfor cognitive impairment should receive\ndiagnostic assessment as appropriate,\nincluding referral to a behavioral health\nprofessional for formal cognitive/neuro-\npsychological evaluation (30).\nHYPOGLYCEMIA\nRecommendations\n13.4\nBecause older adults with di-\nabetes have a greater risk of\nhypoglycemia than younger\nadults, episodes of hypogly-\ncemia should be ascertained\nand addressed at routine\nvisits. B\n13.5\nFor older adults with type 1\ndiabetes, continuous glucose\nmonitoring is recommended to\nreduce hypoglycemia. A\n13.6\nFor older adults with type 2\ndiabetes on multiple daily\ndoses of insulin, continuous\nglucose monitoring should be\nconsidered to improve glyce-\nmic outcomes and decrease\nglucose variability. B\n13.7\nFor older adults with type 1 dia-\nbetes, consider the use of auto-\nmated insulin delivery systems\nB and other advanced insulin\ndelivery devices such as con-\nnected pens E to reduce risk\nof hypoglycemia, based on\nindividual ability.\nOlder adults are at higher risk of hypo-\nglycemia for many reasons, including\ninsulin de\ufb01ciency necessitating insulin\ntherapy and progressive renal insuf\ufb01-\nciency (31). As described above, older\nadults have higher rates of unidenti-\n\ufb01ed cognitive impairment and demen-\ntia, leading to dif\ufb01culties in adhering to\ncomplex self-care activities (e.g., glucose\nmonitoring, insulin dose adjustment).\nCognitive decline has been associated\nwith increased risk of hypoglycemia,\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nOlder Adults\nS217\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "and conversely, severe hypoglycemia has\nbeen linked to increased risk of de-\nmentia\n(32,33).\nTherefore,\nas\ndis-\ncussed in Recommendation 13.3, it is\nimportant to routinely screen older\nadults for cognitive impairment and\ndementia and discuss \ufb01ndings with\nthe patients and their caregivers.\nPeople with diabetes and their care-\ngivers should be routinely queried about\nhypoglycemia (e.g., selected questions\nfrom the Diabetes Care Pro\ufb01le) (34) and\nhypoglycemia unawareness (35). Older\nadults can also be strati\ufb01ed for future risk\nfor hypoglycemia with validated risk calcu-\nlators (e.g., Kaiser Hypoglycemia Model)\n(36). An important step to mitigate hypo-\nglycemia risk is to determine whether the\nperson with diabetes is skipping meals\nor inadvertently repeating doses of their\nmedications. Glycemic targets and phar-\nmacologic treatments may need to be\nadjusted to minimize the occurrence of\nhypoglycemic events (2). This recommen-\ndation is supported by results from mul-\ntiple randomized controlled trials, such\nas the Action to Control Cardiovascular\nRisk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study and the\nVeterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT),\nwhich showed that intensive treatment\nprotocols targeting A1C <6.0% with com-\nplex drug regimens signi\ufb01cantly increased\nthe risk for hypoglycemia requiring assis-\ntance compared with standard treat-\nment (37,38). However, these intensive\ntreatment plans included extensive use\nof insulin and minimal use of glucagon-\nlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists,\nand they preceded the availability of\nsodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)\ninhibitors.\nFor older people with type 1 diabetes,\ncontinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is\na useful approach to predicting and re-\nducing the risk of hypoglycemia (39). In\nthe Wireless Innovation in Seniors with\nDiabetes Mellitus (WISDM) trial, adults\nover 60 years of age with type 1 diabe-\ntes were randomized to CGM or stan-\ndard blood glucose monitoring. Over\n6 months, use of CGM resulted in a small\nbut statistically signi\ufb01cant reduction in\ntime spent with hypoglycemia (glucose\nlevel <70 mg/dL) compared with standard\nblood glucose monitoring (adjusted treat-\nment difference \u00011.9% [\u000127 min/day];\n95% CI \u00012.8% to \u00011.1% [\u000140 to\n\u000116 min/day]; P < 0.001) (40,41). Among\nsecondary outcomes, glycemic variability\nwas reduced with CGM, as re\ufb02ected by an\n8% (95% CI 6.0\u201311.5) increase in time\nspent in range between 70 and 180 mg/dL.\nA 6-month extension of the trial demon-\nstrated that these bene\ufb01ts were sustained\nfor up to a year (42). These and other\nshort-term trials are supported by obser-\nvational data from the Diabetes Control\nand Complications Trial/Epidemiology of\nDiabetes Interventions and Complications\n(DCCT/EDIC) study indicating that among\nolder adults (mean age 58 years) with\nlong-standing type 1 diabetes, routine\nCGM and insulin pump use was associ-\nated with fewer hypoglycemic events\nand\nhyperglycemic\nexcursions\nand\nlower A1C levels (43).While the current\nevidence base for older adults is pri-\nmarily in type 1 diabetes, the evidence\ndemonstrating the clinical bene\ufb01ts of\nCGM for people with type 2 diabetes\nusing insulin is growing (44) (see Sec-\ntion 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology\u201d). The DI-\nAMOND (Multiple Daily Injections and\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabe-\ntes) study demonstrated that in adults\n$60 years of age with either type 1 or\ntype 2 diabetes using multiple daily injec-\ntions, CGM use was associated with im-\nproved\nA1C\nand\nreduced\nglycemic\nvariability (45). Another population for\nwhich CGM may play an increasing role is\nolder adults with physical or cognitive lim-\nitations who require monitoring of blood\nglucose by a surrogate.\nThe availability of accurate CGM devi-\nces that can communicate with insulin\npumps through Bluetooth has enabled\nthe development of advanced insulin\ndelivery algorithms for pumps. These al-\ngorithms fall into two categories: pre-\ndictive low-glucose suspend algorithms\nthat automatically shut off insulin deliv-\nery if a hypoglycemic event is imminent\nand hybrid closed-loop algorithms that\nautomatically adjust insulin infusion\nrates based on feedback from a CGM to\nkeep glucose levels in a target range. Ad-\nvanced insulin delivery devices have been\nshown to improve glycemic outcomes in\nboth children and adults with type 1 dia-\nbetes. Most trials of these devices have\nincluded a broad range of people with\ntype 1 diabetes but relatively few older\nadults. Recently, two small randomized\ncontrolled trials in older adults have been\npublished. The Older Adult Closed Loop\n(ORACL) trial in 30 older adults (mean\nage 67 years) with type 1 diabetes found\nthat a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery\nstrategy was associated with signi\ufb01cant\nimprovements in time in range compared\nwith sensor-augmented pump therapy\n(46). Moreover, they found small but sig-\nni\ufb01cant decreases in hypoglycemia with\nthe hybrid closed-loop strategy. Boughton\net al. (47) reported results of an open-\nlabel, crossover design clinical trial in\n37 older adults ($60 years) in which\n16 weeks of treatment with a hybrid\nclosed-loop advanced insulin delivery\nsystem was compared with sensor-\naugmented pump therapy. They found\nthat hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery\nimproved the proportion of time glucose\nwas in range largely due to decreases in\nhyperglycemia. In contrast to the ORACL\nstudy, no signi\ufb01cant differences in hypo-\nglycemia were observed. Both studies\nenrolled older individuals whose blood\nglucose was relatively well managed\n(mean A1C \u00037.4%), and both used\na crossover design comparing hybrid\nclosed-loop insulin delivery to sensor-\naugmented pump therapy. These trials\nprovide the \ufb01rst evidence that older\nindividuals with long-standing type 1\ndiabetes can successfully use advanced\ninsulin delivery technologies to improve\nglycemic outcomes, as has been seen in\nyounger populations. Use of such technol-\nogies should be periodically reassessed,\nas the burden may outweigh the bene-\n\ufb01ts in those with declining cognitive or\nfunctional status.\nTREATMENT GOALS\nRecommendations\n13.8\nOlder adults who are other-\nwise healthy with few coexist-\ning chronic illnesses and intact\ncognitive function and func-\ntional status should have lower\nglycemic goals (such as A1C\n<7.0\u20137.5% [53\u201358 mmol/mol]),\nwhile those with multiple\ncoexisting chronic illnesses,\ncognitive impairment, or\nfunctional dependence should\nhave less-stringent glycemic\ngoals (such as A1C <8.0%\n[64 mmol/mol]). C\n13.9\nGlycemic goals for some older\nadults might reasonably be\nrelaxed as part of individual-\nized care, but hyperglycemia\nleading to symptoms or risk\nof acute hyperglycemia com-\nplications should be avoided\nin all people with diabetes.

    "text": "13.10 Screening for diabetes compli-\ncations should be individualized\nin older adults. Particular atten-\ntion should be paid to compli-\ncations that would lead to\nfunctional impairment. C\n13.11 Treatment of hypertension to\nindividualized target levels is in-\ndicated in most older adults. C\n13.12 Treatment of other cardiovas-\ncular risk factors should be\nindividualized in older adults\nconsidering the time frame of\nbene\ufb01t. Lipid-lowering therapy\nand aspirin therapy may bene-\n\ufb01t those with life expectancies\nat least equal to the time\nframe of primary prevention or\nsecondary intervention trials. E\nThe care of older adults with diabetes is\ncomplicated by their clinical, cognitive,\nand functional heterogeneity. Some older\nindividuals may have developed diabetes\nyears earlier and have signi\ufb01cant compli-\ncations, others are newly diagnosed and\nmay have had years of undiagnosed dia-\nbetes with resultant complications, and\nstill, other older adults may have truly\nrecent-onset disease with few or no com-\nplications (48). Some older adults with di-\nabetes have other underlying chronic\nconditions, substantial diabetes-related\ncomorbidity, limited cognitive or physical\nfunctioning, or frailty (49,50). Other older\nindividuals with diabetes have little co-\nmorbidity and are active. Life expectan-\ncies are highly variable but are often\nlonger than clinicians realize. Multiple\nprognostic tools for life expectancy for\nolder adults are available (51), includ-\ning tools speci\ufb01cally designed for older\nadults with diabetes (52). Older pa-\ntients also vary in their preferences\nfor the intensity and mode of glucose\ncontrol (53). Health care professionals\ncaring for older adults with diabetes\nmust take this heterogeneity into con-\nsideration when setting and prioritizing\ntreatment goals (9,10) (Table 13.1). In\naddition, older adults with diabetes\nshould be assessed for disease treat-\nment and self-management knowledge,\nhealth literacy, and mathematical\nliteracy (numeracy) at the onset of\ntreatment. See Fig. 6.2 for patient/\ndisease-related factors to consider when\ndetermining individualized glycemic\ntargets.\nA1C may have limitations in those\nwho have medical conditions that im-\npact red blood cell turnover (see Sec-\ntion 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of\nDiabetes,\u201d for additional details on the\nlimitations of A1C) (54). Many condi-\ntions associated with increased red\nblood cell turnover, such as hemodialy-\nsis, recent blood loss or transfusion, or\nerythropoietin therapy, are commonly\nseen in older adults and can falsely in-\ncrease or decrease A1C. In these instan-\nces, plasma blood glucose \ufb01ngerstick\nand sensor glucose readings should be\nused for goal setting (Table 13.1).\nOlder Adults With Good Functional\nStatus and Without Complications\nThere are few long-term studies in older\nadults demonstrating the bene\ufb01ts of in-\ntensive glycemic, blood pressure, and\nlipid control. Older adults who can be ex-\npected to live long enough to realize the\nbene\ufb01ts of long-term intensive diabetes\nmanagement, who have good cognitive\nand physical function, and who choose\nto do so via shared decision-making may\nbe treated using therapeutic inter-\nventions and goals similar to those\nfor younger adults with diabetes (Table\n13.1).\nAs for all people with diabetes, diabe-\ntes self-management education and on-\ngoing diabetes self-management support\nare vital components of diabetes care\nfor older adults and their caregivers. Self-\nmanagement knowledge and skills should\nbe reassessed when treatment plan\nchanges are made or an individual\u2019s func-\ntional abilities diminish. In addition, de-\nclining or impaired ability to perform\ndiabetes self-care behaviors may be an\nindication that an older person with dia-\nbetes needs a referral for cognitive and\nphysical functional assessment, using age-\nnormalized evaluation tools, as well as\nhelp establishing a support structure\nfor diabetes care (3,30).\nPatients With Complications and\nReduced Functionality\nFor people with advanced diabetes comp-\nlications, life-limiting comorbid illnesses,\nor substantial cognitive or functional im-\npairments, it is reasonable to set less-\nintensive glycemic goals (Table 13.1).\nFactors to consider in individualizing gly-\ncemic goals are outlined in Fig. 6.2.\nBased on concepts of competing mortal-\nity and time to bene\ufb01t, people with ad-\nvanced diabetes complications are less\nlikely to bene\ufb01t from reducing the risk of\nmicrovascular complications (55). In addi-\ntion, they are more likely to suffer seri-\nous adverse effects of therapeutics, such\nas hypoglycemia (56). However, those\nwith poorly managed diabetes may be\nsubject to acute complications of diabe-\ntes, including dehydration, poor wound\nhealing, and hyperglycemic hyperosmo-\nlar coma. Glycemic goals should, at a\nminimum, avoid these consequences.\nWhile Table 13.1 provides overall\nguidance for identifying complex and\nvery complex patients, there is not yet\nglobal consensus on geriatric patient\nclassi\ufb01cation. Ongoing empiric research\non the classi\ufb01cation of older adults with\ndiabetes based on comorbid illness has\nrepeatedly found three major classes\nof patients: a healthy, a geriatric, and a\ncardiovascular class (9,57). The geriatric\nclass has the highest prevalence of obe-\nsity, hypertension, arthritis, and inconti-\nnence, and the cardiovascular class has\nthe highest prevalence of myocardial\ninfarctions, heart failure, and stroke.\nCompared with the healthy class, the\ncardiovascular class has the highest risk\nof frailty and subsequent mortality. Ad-\nditional research is needed to develop a\nreproducible classi\ufb01cation scheme to\ndistinguish the natural history of disease\nas well as differential response to glu-\ncose control and speci\ufb01c glucose-lowering\nagents (58).\nVulnerable Patients at the End of Life\nFor people with diabetes receiving pallia-\ntive care and end-of-life care, the focus\nshould be to avoid hypoglycemia and\nsymptomatic hyperglycemia while reduc-\ning the burdens of glycemic management.\nThus, as organ failure develops, several\nagents will have to be deintensi\ufb01ed or\ndiscontinued. For a dying person, most\nagents for type 2 diabetes may be re-\nmoved (59). There is, however, no con-\nsensus for the management of type 1\ndiabetes in this scenario (60). See the sec-\ntion END-OF-LIFE CARE below for additional\ninformation.\nBeyond Glycemic Management\nAlthough\nminimizing\nhyperglycemia\nmay be important in older individuals\nwith diabetes, greater reductions in\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nOlder Adults\nS219\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Diabetes\nis also recognized as an independent risk\nfactor for frailty. Frailty is characterized by\ndecline in physical performance and an\nincreased risk of poor health outcomes\ndue to physiologic vulnerability and func-\ntional or psychosocial stressors. Inadequate\nnutritional intake, particularly inadequate\nprotein intake, can increase the risk of\nsarcopenia and frailty in older adults.\nManagement of frailty in diabetes in-\ncludes optimal nutrition with adequate\nprotein intake combined with an exercise\nprogram that includes aerobic, weight-\nbearing, and resistance training.

The Look AHEAD\n(Action for Health in Diabetes) trial is\ndescribed in Section 8, \u201cObesity and\nWeight Management for the Prevention\nand Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.\u201d\nLook AHEAD speci\ufb01cally excluded indi-\nviduals with a low functional status.\nIt enrolled people between 45 and\n74 years of age and required that they\nbe able to perform a maximal exercise\ntest (69,70). While the Look AHEAD trial\ndid not achieve its primary outcome of\nreducing cardiovascular events, the in-\ntensive lifestyle intervention had multiple\nclinical bene\ufb01ts that are important to\nthe quality of life of older adults. Bene-\n\ufb01ts included weight loss, improved physi-\ncal \ufb01tness, increased HDL cholesterol,\nlowered systolic blood pressure, reduced\nA1C levels, reduced waist circumference,\nand reduced need for medications (71).\nAdditionally, several subgroups, including\nparticipants who lost at least 10% of\nbaseline body weight at year 1, had\nimproved cardiovascular outcomes (72).\nRisk factor control was improved with\nreduced utilization of antihypertensive\nmedications, statins, and insulin (73).\nIn age-strati\ufb01ed analyses, older adults\nin the trial (60 to early 70s) had simi-\nlar bene\ufb01ts compared with younger\npeople (74,75). In addition, lifestyle in-\ntervention produced bene\ufb01ts on aging-\nrelevant outcomes such as reductions\nin multimorbidity and improvements\nin physical function and quality of life\n(76\u201379).\nPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY\nRecommendations\n13.15 In older adults with type 2 dia-\nbetes at increased risk of hy-\npoglycemia, medication classes\nwith low risk of hypoglycemia\nare preferred. B\n13.16 Overtreatment of diabetes is\ncommon in older adults and\nshould be avoided. B\n13.17 Deintensi\ufb01cation of treatment\ngoals is recommended to reduce\nthe risk of hypoglycemia if it\ncan be achieved within the in-\ndividualized A1C target. B\n13.18 Simpli\ufb01cation of complex treat-\nment plans (especially insulin)\nis recommended to reduce the\nrisk of hypoglycemia and poly-\npharmacy and decrease the\nburden of the disease if it can\nbe achieved within the individ-\nualized A1C target. B\n13.19 Consider costs of care and in-\nsurance coverage rules when\ndeveloping treatment plans in\norder to reduce risk of cost-\nrelated barriers to adherence. B\nSpecial care is required in prescribing\nand monitoring pharmacologic therapies\nin older adults (80). See Fig. 9.3 for gen-\neral recommendations regarding gluco-\nse-lowering treatment for adults with\ntype 2 diabetes and Table 9.2 for per-\nson- and drug-speci\ufb01c factors to consider\nwhen selecting glucose-lowering agents.\nCost may be an especially important\nconsideration, as older adults tend to be\non many medications and live on \ufb01xed\nincomes (81). Accordingly, the costs of\ncare and insurance coverage rules should\nbe considered when developing treat-\nment plans to reduce the risk of cost-\nrelated barriers to adherence (82,83).\nSee Table 9.3 and Table 9.4 for median\nmonthly cost in the U.S. of noninsulin\nglucose-lowering agents and insulin, re-\nspectively. It is important to match\ncomplexity of the treatment plan to the\nself-management ability of older adults\nwith diabetes and their available social\nand medical support. Many older adults\nwith diabetes struggle to maintain the fre-\nquent blood glucose monitoring and insu-\nlin injection regimens they previously\nfollowed, perhaps for many decades, as\nthey develop medical conditions that may\nimpair their ability to follow their treat-\nment plan safely. Individualized glycemic\ngoals should be established (Fig. 6.2) and\nperiodically adjusted based on coexisting\nchronic illnesses, cognitive function, and\nfunctional status (2). Intensive glycemic\ncontrol with regimens including insulin\nand sulfonylureas in older adults with\ncomplex or very complex medical con-\nditions has been identi\ufb01ed as over-\ntreatment and found to be very common\nin clinical practice (84\u201388). Ultimately, the\ndetermination of whether a person is\nconsidered overtreated requires an elicita-\ntion of the person\u2019s perceptions of the\ncurrent medication burden and preferen-\nces for treatments. For those seeking to\nsimplify their diabetes regimen, deintensi-\n\ufb01cation of regimens in individuals taking\nnoninsulin glucose-lowering medications\ncan be achieved by either lowering the\ndose or discontinuing some medications,\nas long as the individualized glycemic tar-\ngets are maintained (89). When older\nadults are found to have an insulin regi-\nmen with complexity beyond their self-\nmanagement abilities, lowering the dose\nof insulin may not be adequate (90). Sim-\npli\ufb01cation of the insulin plan to match an\nindividual\u2019s self-management abilities and\ntheir available social and medical support\nin these situations has been shown to re-\nduce hypoglycemia and disease-related\ndistress without worsening glycemic out-\ncomes (91\u201394). Figure 13.1 depicts an al-\ngorithm that can be used to simplify the\ninsulin regimen (93). There are now multi-\nple studies evaluating deintensi\ufb01cation\nprotocols in diabetes as well as hyperten-\nsion, demonstrating that deintensi\ufb01cation\nis safe and possibly bene\ufb01cial for older\nadults (89). Table 13.2 provides examples\nof and rationale for situations where de-\nintensi\ufb01cation and/or insulin regimen\nsimpli\ufb01cation may be appropriate in\nolder adults.\nMetformin\nMetformin is the \ufb01rst-line agent for older\nadults with type 2 diabetes. Recent stud-\nies have indicated that it may be used\nsafely in individuals with estimated glo-\nmerular \ufb01ltration rate $30 mL/min/\n1.73 m2 (95). However, it is contraindi-\ncated in those with advanced renal insuf-\n\ufb01ciency and should be used with caution\nin those with impaired hepatic function\nor heart failure because of the increased\nrisk of lactic acidosis. Metformin may be\ntemporarily discontinued before proce-\ndures, during hospitalizations, and when\nacute illness may compromise renal or\nliver function. Additionally, metformin can\ncause gastrointestinal side effects and a\nreduction in appetite that can be prob-\nlematic for some older adults. Reduction\nor elimination of metformin may be nec-\nessary for those experiencing persistent\ngastrointestinal side effects.

Glyburide is a longer-acting\nsulfonylurea and should be avoided in\nolder adults (99).\nIncretin-Based Therapies\nOral dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)\ninhibitors have few side effects and\nminimal risk of hypoglycemia, but their\ncost may be a barrier to some older\nadults. DPP-4 inhibitors do not reduce\nor increase major adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes (100). Across the trials of this\ndrug class, there appears to be no inter-\naction by age-group (101\u2013103). A chal-\nlenge of interpreting the age-strati\ufb01ed\nanalyses of this drug class and other car-\ndiovascular outcomes trials is that while\nmost of these analyses were prespeci-\n\ufb01ed, they were not powered to detect\ndifferences.\nGLP-1 receptor agonists have demon-\nstrated cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts among\npeople with diabetes and established\natherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\n(ASCVD) and those at higher ASCVD\nrisk, and newer trials are expanding\nour understanding of their bene\ufb01ts in\nother populations (100). See Section 9,\n\u201cPharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic\nTreatment,\u201d and Section 10, \u201cCardio-\nvascular Disease and Risk Management,\u201d\nfor a more extensive discussion regard-\ning the speci\ufb01c indications for this class\nof agents. In a systematic review and\nmeta-analysis of GLP-1 receptor agonist\ntrials, these agents have been found to\nreduce\nmajor\nadverse\ncardiovascular\nevents, cardiovascular deaths, stroke, and\nmyocardial infarction to the same degree\nfor people over and under 65 years of\nage (104). While the evidence for this class\nof agents for older adults continues to\ngrow, there are a number of practical is-\nsues that should be considered speci\ufb01-\ncally for older people.

Given\nthe gastrointestinal side effects of this\nclass, GLP-1 receptor agonists may not\nbe preferred in older adults who are\nexperiencing unexplained weight loss.\nSodium\u2013Glucose Cotransporter 2\nInhibitors\nSGLT2 inhibitors are administered orally,\nwhich may be convenient for older adults\nwith diabetes. In those with established\nASCVD, these agents have shown cardio-\nvascular bene\ufb01ts (100). This class of\nagents has also been found to be ben-\ne\ufb01cial for people with heart failure and\nto slow the progression of chronic kidney\ndisease. See Section 9, \u201cPharmacologic\nApproaches to Glycemic Treatment,\u201d and\nSection 10, \u201cCardiovascular Disease and\nRisk Management,\u201d for a more extensive\ndiscussion regarding the indications for\nthis class of agents. The strati\ufb01ed analy-\nses of the trials of this drug class indicate\nthat older adults have similar or greater\nbene\ufb01ts than younger people (106\u2013108).\nWhile understanding of the clinical bene-\n\ufb01ts of this class is evolving, side effects\nsuch as volume depletion, urinary tract\ninfections, and worsening urinary incon-\ntinence may be more common among\nolder people.\nInsulin Therapy\nThe use of insulin therapy requires that\nindividuals or their caregivers have good\nvisual and motor skills and cognitive abil-\nity. Insulin therapy relies on the ability of\nthe older person with diabetes to admin-\nister insulin on their own or with the assis-\ntance of a caregiver. Insulin doses should\nbe titrated to meet individualized glycemic\ntargets and to avoid hypoglycemia.\nOnce-daily basal insulin injection ther-\napy is associated with minimal side ef-\nfects and may be a reasonable option in\nmany older adults (109). When choosing\na basal insulin, long-acting insulin ana-\nlogs have been found to be associated\nwith a lower risk of hypoglycemia com-\npared with NPH insulin in the Medicare\npopulation. Multiple daily injections of\ninsulin may be too complex for an older\nperson with advanced diabetes compli-\ncations, life-limiting coexisting chronic\nillnesses, or limited functional status.\nFigure 13.1 provides a potential ap-\nproach to insulin regimen simpli\ufb01cation.\nOther Factors to Consider\nThe needs of older adults with diabetes\nand their caregivers should be evaluated\nto construct a tailored care plan. Im-\npaired social functioning may reduce\nthese individuals\u2019 quality of life and in-\ncrease the risk of functional dependency\n(7). The person\u2019s living situation must\nbe considered as it may affect diabetes\nmanagement and support needs. Social\nand instrumental support networks (e.g.,\nadult children, caretakers) that provide\ninstrumental or emotional support for\nolder adults with diabetes should be in-\ncluded in diabetes management discus-\nsions and shared decision-making.\nThe need for ongoing support of older\nadults becomes even greater when tran-\nsitions to acute care and long-term care\n(LTC) become necessary. Unfortunately,\nthese transitions can lead to discontinu-\nity in goals of care, errors in dosing, and\nchanges in nutrition and activity (110).\nOlder adults in assisted living facilities\nmay not have support to administer\ntheir own medications, whereas those\nliving in a nursing home (community liv-\ning centers) may rely completely on\nthe care plan and nursing support.\nThose receiving palliative care (with or\nwithout hospice) may require an ap-\nproach that emphasizes comfort and\nsymptom\nmanagement\nwhile\nde-\nemphasizing strict metabolic and blood\npressure control.\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR OLDER\nADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES\nDue in part to the success of modern di-\nabetes management, people with type 1\ndiabetes are living longer, and the popu-\nlation of these people over 65 years of\nage is growing (111\u2013113). Many of the\nrecommendations in this section regard-\ning a comprehensive geriatric assessment\nand personalization of goals and treat-\nments are directly applicable to older\nadults with type 1 diabetes; however, this\npopulation has unique challenges and re-\nquires distinct treatment considerations\n(114). Insulin is an essential life-preserving\ntherapy for people with type 1 diabetes,\nunlike for those with type 2 diabetes. To\navoid diabetic ketoacidosis, older adults\nwith type 1 diabetes need some form of\nbasal insulin even when they are unable\nto ingest meals. Insulin may be delivered\nthrough an insulin pump or injections.\nCGM is approved for use by Medicare\nand can play a critical role in improving\nA1C, reducing glycemic variability, and\nreducing risk of hypoglycemia (45) (see\nSection 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d and\nSection 9, \u201cPharmacologic Approaches to\nGlycemic Treatment\u201d). In older people\nwith type 1 diabetes, administration of\ninsulin may become more dif\ufb01cult as\ncomplications,\ncognitive\nimpairment,\nand functional impairment arise. This in-\ncreases the importance of caregivers in\nthe lives of these individuals. Many\nolder people with type 1 diabetes re-\nquire placement in LTC settings (i.e.,\nnursing homes and skilled nursing facili-\nties) and unfortunately can encounter\nstaff that are less familiar with insulin\npumps or CGM. Some staff may be less\nknowledgeable about the differences\nbetween type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In\nthese instances, the individual or the\nperson\u2019s family may be more familiar\nwith their diabetes management plan\nthan the staff or health care professio-\nnals. Education of relevant support staff\nand health care professionals in rehabil-\nitation and LTC settings regarding insu-\nlin dosing and use of pumps and CGM\nis recommended as part of general dia-\nbetes education (see Recommendations\n13.20 and 13.21).\nTREATMENT IN SKILLED NURSING\nFACILITIES AND NURSING HOMES\nRecommendations\n13.20 Consider diabetes education for\nthe staff of long-term care and\nrehabilitation facilities to im-\nprove the management of older\nadults with diabetes. E\n13.21 People with diabetes residing\nin long-term care facilities need\ncareful assessment to establish\nindividualized glycemic goals\nand\nto\nmake\nappropriate\nchoices of glucose-lowering\nagents based on their clini-\ncal and functional status. E\n13.22 Consider use of continuous\nglucose monitoring to assess\nrisk for hypoglycemia in older\nadults treated with sulfonylur-\neas or insulin. E\nManagement of diabetes in the LTC set-\nting is unique. Individualization of health\ncare is important for all people with dia-\nbetes; however, practical guidance is\nneeded for health care professionals as\nS224\nOlder Adults\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

LTC facilities should develop\ntheir own policies and procedures for\nprevention and management of hypogly-\ncemia. With the increased longevity of\npopulations, the care of people with dia-\nbetes and its complications in LTC is an\narea that warrants greater study.\nResources\nStaff of LTC facilities should receive ap-\npropriate diabetes education to improve\nthe management of older adults with\ndiabetes. Treatments for each patient\nshould be individualized. Special manage-\nment considerations include the need to\navoid both hypoglycemia and the compli-\ncations of hyperglycemia (2,116). For\nmore information, see the ADA position\nstatement \u201cManagement of Diabetes in\nLong-term Care and Skilled Nursing Facili-\nties\u201d (115).\nNutritional Considerations\nAn older adult residing in an LTC facility\nmay have irregular and unpredictable\nmeal consumption, undernutrition, an-\norexia, and impaired swallowing. Further-\nmore, therapeutic diets may inadvertently\nlead to decreased food intake and con-\ntribute to unintentional weight loss and\nundernutrition. Meals tailored to a per-\nson\u2019s culture, preferences, and personal\ngoals may increase quality of life, satisfac-\ntion with meals, and nutrition status\n(117). It may be helpful to give insulin af-\nter meals to ensure that the dose is ap-\npropriate for the amount of carbohydrate\nthe individual consumed in the meal.\nHypoglycemia\nOlder adults with diabetes in LTC are es-\npecially vulnerable to hypoglycemia. They\nhave a disproportionately high number\nof clinical complications and comorbid-\nities that can increase hypoglycemia risk:\nimpaired cognitive and renal function,\nslowed hormonal regulation and counter-\nregulation, suboptimal hydration, variable\nappetite and nutritional intake, polyphar-\nmacy, and slowed intestinal absorption\n(118). Oral agents may achieve glycemic\noutcomes similar to basal insulin in LTC\npopulations (84,119). CGM may be a use-\nful approach to monitoring for hypogly-\ncemia among individuals treated with\ninsulin in LTC, but the data are limited.\nAnother consideration for the LTC set-\nting is that unlike in the hospital setting,\nhealth care professionals are not required\nto evaluate patients daily. According to\nfederal guidelines, assessments should\nbe done at least every 30 days for the\n\ufb01rst 90 days after admission and then\nat least once every 60 days. Although in\npractice patients may actually be seen\nmore frequently, the concern is that\nthese individuals may have uncontrolled\nglucose levels or wide excursions with-\nout the practitioner being noti\ufb01ed. Health\ncare professionals may adjust treat-\nment plans by telephone, fax, or in\nperson directly at the LTC facilities, pro-\nvided they are given timely noti\ufb01cation\nof blood glucose management issues\nfrom a standardized alert system.\nThe following alert strategy could be\nconsidered:\n1. Call health care professional imme-\ndiately in cases of low blood glucose\nlevels (<70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]).\n2. Call as soon as possible when\na) glucose values are 70\u2013100 mg/dL\n(3.9\u20135.6 mmol/L) (treatment plan\nmay need to be adjusted),\nb) glucose values are consistently\n>250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) within\na 24-h period,\nc) glucose values are consistently\n>300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) over\n2 consecutive days,\nd) any reading is too high for the\nglucose monitoring device, or\ne) the person is sick, with vomiting,\nsymptomatic hyperglycemia, or\npoor oral intake.\nEND-OF-LIFE CARE\nRecommendations\n13.23 When palliative care is needed\nin older adults with diabetes,\nhealth care professionals should\ninitiate conversations regard-\ning the goals and intensity of\ncare. Strict glucose and blood\npressure control are not nec-\nessary E, and simpli\ufb01cation of\nregimens can be considered.\nSimilarly, the intensity of lipid\nmanagement can be relaxed,\nand withdrawal of lipid-lowering\ntherapy may be appropriate. A\n13.24 Overall comfort, prevention\nof distressing symptoms, and\npreservation of quality of life\nand dignity are primary goals\nfor diabetes management at\nthe end of life. C\nThe management of the older adult at\nthe end of life receiving palliative medi-\ncine or hospice care is a unique situation.\nOverall, palliative medicine promotes\ncomfort, symptom control and preven-\ntion (pain, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,\nand dehydration), and preservation of\ndignity and quality of life in older adults\nwith limited life expectancy (116,120). In\nthe setting of palliative care, health care\nprofessionals should initiate conversa-\ntions regarding the goals and intensity of\ndiabetes care; strict glucose and blood\npressure control may not be consistent\nwith achieving comfort and quality of\nlife. Avoidance of severe hypertension\nand hyperglycemia aligns with the goals\nof palliative care. In a multicenter trial,\nwithdrawal of statins among people with\ndiabetes in palliative care was found to\nimprove quality of life (121\u2013123). The ev-\nidence for the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of de-\nintensi\ufb01cation protocols in older adults is\ngrowing for both glucose and blood pres-\nsure control (88,124) and is clearly rele-\nvant for palliative care. An individual has\nthe right to refuse testing and treatment,\nwhereas health care professionals may\nconsider withdrawing treatment and lim-\niting diagnostic testing, including a\nreduction in the frequency of blood\nglucose monitoring (125,126). Glucose\ntargets should aim to prevent hypoglyce-\nmia and hyperglycemia. Treatment inter-\nventions need to be mindful of quality\nof life. Careful monitoring of oral intake\nis warranted. The decision process may\nneed to involve the individual, family,\nand caregivers, leading to a care plan\nthat is both convenient and effective for\nthe goals of care (127). The pharmaco-\nlogic therapy may include oral agents as\n\ufb01rst line, followed by a simpli\ufb01ed insulin\nregimen. If needed, basal insulin can be\nimplemented, accompanied by oral agents\nand without rapid-acting insulin. Agents\nthat can cause gastrointestinal symptoms\nsuch as nausea or excess weight loss may\nnot be good choices in this setting. As\nsymptoms progress, some agents may\nbe slowly tapered and discontinued.\nDifferent patient categories have been\nproposed for diabetes management in\nthose with advanced disease (59).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nOlder Adults\nS225\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

A stable patient: Continue with the\nperson\u2019s previous regimen, with a\nfocus\non\n1)\nthe\nprevention\nof\nhypoglycemia and 2) the manage-\nment of hyperglycemia using blood\nglucose testing, keeping levels below\nthe renal threshold of glucose, and\nhyperglycemia-mediated dehydration.\nThere is no role for A1C monitoring.\n2. A patient with organ failure: Pre-\nventing hypoglycemia is of greatest\nsigni\ufb01cance. Dehydration must be\nprevented and treated. In people\nwith type 1 diabetes, insulin admin-\nistration may be reduced as the oral\nintake of food decreases but should\nnot be stopped. For those with type 2\ndiabetes, agents that may cause hy-\npoglycemia should be reduced in\ndose. The main goal is to avoid hypo-\nglycemia, allowing for glucose values\nin the upper level of the desired tar-\nget range.\n3. A dying patient: For people with\ntype 2 diabetes, the discontinuation\nof all medications may be a reason-\nable approach, as these individuals\nare unlikely to have any oral intake.\nIn people with type 1 diabetes, there\nis no consensus, but a small amount\nof basal insulin may maintain glucose\nlevels and prevent acute hyperglyce-\nmic complications.\nReferences\n1.

Members of the ADA Professional\nPractice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for up-\ndating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a de-\ntailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the\nevidence-grading system for ADA\u2019s clinical practice recommendations and a full\nlist of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction\nand Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are\ninvited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.\nThe management of diabetes in children and adolescents (individuals <18 years of\nage) cannot simply be derived from care routinely provided to adults with diabetes.\nThe epidemiology, pathophysiology, developmental considerations, and response to\ntherapy in pediatric diabetes are often different from those of adult diabetes. There\nare also differences in recommended care for children and adolescents with type 1\ndiabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of pediatric diabetes. This section is di-\nvided into two major parts: the \ufb01rst part addresses care for children and adolescents\nwith type 1 diabetes, and the second part addresses care for children and adoles-\ncents with type 2 diabetes. Monogenic diabetes (neonatal diabetes and maturity-\nonset diabetes in the young [MODY]) and cystic \ufb01brosis\u2013related diabetes, which are\noften present in youth, are discussed in Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of\nDiabetes.\u201d Table 14.1A and Table 14.1B provide an overview of the recommenda-\ntions for screening and treatment of complications and related conditions in pediatric\ntype 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. In addition to comprehensive dia-\nbetes care, youth with diabetes should receive age-appropriate and developmentally\nappropriate pediatric care, including vaccines and immunizations as recommended\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1). To ensure continuity of\ncare as an adolescent with diabetes becomes an adult, guidance is provided at the\nend of this section on the transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care.\nDue to the nature of pediatric clinical research, the recommendations for children\nand adolescents with diabetes are less likely to be based on clinical trial evidence.\nHowever, expert opinion and a review of available and relevant experimental data\nare summarized in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statements\n\u201cType 1 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents\u201d (2) and \u201cEvaluation and Management\nof Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\u201d (3). Finally, other sections in the Standards of Care\nmay have recommendations that apply to youth with diabetes and are referenced in\nthe narrative of this section.\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G,\nAroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.\n14.

    "text": "TYPE 1 DIABETES\nType 1 diabetes is the most common\nform of diabetes in youth (4), although\ndata suggest that it may account for a\nlarge proportion of cases diagnosed in\nadult life (5). The health care profes-\nsional must consider the unique aspects\nof care and management of children\nand adolescents with type 1 diabetes,\nsuch as changes in insulin sensitivity re-\nlated to physical growth and sexual\nmaturation, ability to provide self-care,\nsupervision in the childcare and school\nenvironment, neurological vulnerability\nto hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in\nyoung children, and possible adverse\nneurocognitive effects of diabetic ketoa-\ncidosis (DKA) (6,7). Attention to family\ndynamics, developmental stages, and\nphysiologic differences related to sexual\nmaturity is essential in developing and\nimplementing an optimal diabetes treat-\nment plan (8).\nA multidisciplinary team trained in pedi-\natric diabetes management and sensitive\nto the challenges of children and adoles-\ncents with type 1 diabetes and their fami-\nlies should provide diabetes-speci\ufb01c care\nfor this population. It is essential that di-\nabetes self-management education and\nsupport, medical nutrition therapy, and\npsychosocial support be provided at di-\nagnosis and regularly thereafter in a de-\nvelopmentally appropriate format that\nbuilds on prior knowledge by a team of\nhealth care professionals experienced\nwith the biological, educational, nutri-\ntional, behavioral, and emotional needs\nof the growing child and family. The dia-\nbetes team, taking into consideration\nthe youth\u2019s developmental and psycho-\nsocial needs, should ask about and ad-\nvise the youth and parents/caregivers\nabout diabetes management responsibil-\nities on an ongoing basis.\nDiabetes Self-Management Education\nand Support\nRecommendation\n14.1 Youth with type 1 diabetes and\ntheir parents/caregivers (for\npatients aged <18 years) should\nreceive culturally sensitive and\ndevelopmentally appropriate\nindividualized diabetes self-\nmanagement education and sup-\nport according to national stand-\nards at diagnosis and routinely\nthereafter. B\nSelf-management in pediatric diabetes\ninvolves both the youth and their pa-\nrents/adult caregivers. No matter how\nsound the medical plan is, it can only\nbe effective if the family and/or affected\nindividuals are able to implement it.\nFamily involvement is a vital compo-\nnent of optimal diabetes management\nthroughout childhood and adolescence.\nAs parents/caregivers are critical to dia-\nbetes self-management in youth, diabe-\ntes care requires an approach that places\nthe youth and their parents/caregivers at\nthe center of the care model. The pediat-\nric diabetes care team must be capable\nof evaluating the educational, behavioral,\nemotional, and psychosocial factors that\nimpact the implementation of a treat-\nment plan and must work with the youth\nand family to overcome barriers or rede-\n\ufb01ne goals as appropriate. Diabetes self-\nmanagement education and support\nrequires periodic reassessment, espe-\ncially as the youth grows, develops, and\nacquires the need and desire for greater\nindependent self-care skills. The pediat-\nric diabetes team should work with the\nyouth and their parents/caregivers to\nensure there is not a premature transfer\nof self-management tasks to the youth\nduring this time. In addition, it is neces-\nsary to assess the educational needs\nand skills of, and provide training to,\nday care workers, school nurses, and\nschool personnel who are responsible\nfor the care and supervision of the\nchild with diabetes (9\u201311).\nNutrition Therapy\nRecommendations\n14.2 Individualized medical nutri-\ntion therapy is recommended\nfor youth with type 1 diabe-\ntes as an essential compo-\nnent of the overall treatment\nplan. A\n14.3 Monitoring carbohydrate in-\ntake, whether by carbohy-\ndrate counting or experience-\nbased estimation, is a key\ncomponent to optimizing gly-\ncemic management. B\n14.4 Comprehensive nutrition educa-\ntion at diagnosis, with annual\nupdates, by an experienced reg-\nistered dietitian nutritionist, is\nrecommended to assess caloric\nand nutrition intake in relation\nto weight status and cardiovas-\ncular disease risk factors and to\ninform macronutrient choices. E\nNutrition management should be indi-\nvidualized: family habits, food preferen-\nces, religious or cultural needs, \ufb01nances,\nschedules, physical activity, and the youth\u2019s\nand family\u2019s abilities in numeracy, literacy,\nand self-management should be consid-\nered. Visits with a registered dietitian nu-\ntritionist should include assessment for\nchanges in food preferences over time,\naccess to food, growth, and develop-\nment, weight status, cardiovascular risk,\nand potential for disordered eating. Fol-\nlowing recommended nutrition plans is\nassociated with better glycemic outcomes\nin youth with type 1 diabetes (12).\nPhysical Activity and Exercise\nRecommendations\n14.5 Physical activity is recommended\nfor all youth with type 1 diabe-\ntes with the goal of 60 min of\nmoderate- to vigorous-intensity\naerobic activity daily, with vigor-\nous\nmuscle-strengthening\nand\nbone-strengthening activities at\nleast 3 days per week. C\n14.6 Frequent glucose monitoring be-\nfore, during, and after exercise,\nvia blood glucose meter or con-\ntinuous glucose monitoring, is\nimportant to prevent, detect,\nand treat hypoglycemia and\nhyperglycemia associated with\nexercise. C\n14.7 Youth and their parents/care-\ngivers should receive education\non targets and management of\nglycemia before, during, and af-\nter physical activity, individual-\nized according to the type and\nintensity of the planned physical\nactivity. E\n14.8 Youth and their parents/care-\ngivers should be educated on\nstrategies to prevent hypogly-\ncemia during, after, and over-\nnight following physical activity\nand exercise, which may in-\nclude reducing prandial insulin\ndosing for the meal/snack pre-\nceding (and, if needed, follow-\ning) exercise, reducing basal\ninsulin doses, increasing carbo-\nhydrate intake, eating bedtime\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nChildren and Adolescents\nS233\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

While it affects insulin sensitivity,\nphysical \ufb01tness, strength building, weight\nmanagement, social interaction, mood,\nself-esteem building, and the creation of\nhealthful habits for adulthood, it also has\nthe potential to cause both hypoglyce-\nmia and hyperglycemia.\nSee below for strategies to mitigate\nhypoglycemia risk and minimize hyper-\nglycemia associated with exercise. For\nan in-depth discussion, see reviews and\nguidelines (14\u201316).\nOverall, it is recommended that youth\nparticipate in 60 min of moderate-\nintensity (e.g., brisk walking, dancing)\nto vigorous-intensity (e.g., running,\njumping rope) aerobic activity daily,\nincluding resistance and \ufb02exibility train-\ning (17). Although uncommon in the pe-\ndiatric population, patients should be\nmedically evaluated for comorbid condi-\ntions or diabetes complications that may\nrestrict participation in an exercise pro-\ngram. As hyperglycemia can occur be-\nfore, during, and after physical activity,\nit is important to ensure that the ele-\nvated glucose level is not related to\ninsulin de\ufb01ciency that would lead to\nworsening hyperglycemia with exercise\nand ketosis risk. Intense activity should\nbe postponed with marked hyperglyce-\nmia (glucose $350 mg/dL [19.4 mmol/L]),\nmoderate to large urine ketones, and/or\nb-hydroxybutyrate (B-OHB) >1.5 mmol/L.\nCaution may be needed when B-OHB\nlevels are $0.6 mmol/L (12,14).\nThe prevention and treatment of hy-\npoglycemia associated with physical ac-\ntivity include decreasing the prandial\ninsulin for the meal/snack before exer-\ncise and/or increasing food intake. Youth\non insulin pumps can lower basal rates\nby \u000110\u201350% or more or suspend for\n1\u20132 h during exercise (18). Decreasing\nbasal rates or long-acting insulin doses by\n\u000120% after exercise may reduce delayed\nexercise-induced hypoglycemia (19). Ac-\ncessible rapid-acting carbohydrates and\nfrequent blood glucose monitoring before,\nduring, and after exercise, with or without\ncontinuous glucose monitoring (CGM),\nmaximize safety with exercise. The use\nof hybrid closed-loop systems may im-\nprove time in range (70\u2013180 mg/dL) dur-\ning exercise, and youth can use \u201cexercise\nmode\u201d to prevent hypoglycemia (20).\nBlood glucose targets prior to physi-\ncal activity and exercise should be\n126\u2013180 mg/dL (7.0\u201310.0 mmol/L) but\nshould be individualized based on the\ntype, intensity, and duration of activity\n(14,16). Consider additional carbohydrate\nintake during and/or after exercise, de-\npending on the duration and intensity of\nphysical activity, to prevent hypoglycemia.\nFor low- to moderate-intensity aerobic ac-\ntivities (30\u201360 min), and if the youth is\nfasting, 10\u201315 g of carbohydrate may pre-\nvent hypoglycemia (21). After insulin bo-\nluses (relative hyperinsulinemia), consider\n0.5\u20131.0 g of carbohydrates/kg per hour\nof exercise (\u000130\u201360 g), which is similar\nto carbohydrate requirements to opti-\nmize performance in athletes without\ntype 1 diabetes (22\u201324).\nIn addition, obesity is as common in\nyouth with type 1 diabetes as in those\nwithout diabetes. It is associated with a\nhigher frequency of cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors, and it disproportionately affects ra-\ncial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. (25\u201329).\nTherefore, diabetes health care profes-\nsionals should monitor weight status and\nencourage a healthy eating pattern, physi-\ncal activity, and healthy weight as key com-\nponents of pediatric type 1 diabetes care.\nSchool and Child Care\nAs a large portion of a youth\u2019s day is\nspent in school and/or day care, training\nof school or day care personnel to pro-\nvide care in accordance with the child\u2019s\nindividualized diabetes medical manage-\nment plan is essential for optimal diabe-\ntes management and safe access to all\nschool or day care-sponsored opportuni-\nties (10,11,30). In addition, federal and\nstate laws require schools, day care facili-\nties, and other entities to provide needed\ndiabetes care to enable the child to safely\naccess the school or day care environ-\nment.

B\nRapid and dynamic cognitive, develop-\nmental, and emotional changes occur dur-\ning childhood, adolescence, and emerging\nadulthood. Diabetes management during\nchildhood and adolescence places sub-\nstantial burdens on the youth and family,\nnecessitating ongoing assessment of psy-\nchosocial status, social determinants of\nhealth, and diabetes distress in the youth\nand the parents/caregivers during routine\ndiabetes visits (31\u201341). It is important to\nconsider the impact of diabetes on quality\nof life as well as the development of men-\ntal health problems related to diabetes\ndistress, fear of hypoglycemia (and hyper-\nglycemia), symptoms of anxiety, dis-\nordered eating behaviors and eating\ndisorders, and symptoms of depression\n(42). Consider screening youth for diabe-\ntes distress, generally starting at 7 or\n8 years of age (43). Consider screening\nfor depression and disordered eating\nbehaviors using available screening tools\n(44,45). Early detection of depression,\nanxiety, disordered eating, and learn-\ning disabilities can facilitate effective\ntreatment options and help minimize\nadverse effects on diabetes manage-\nment and disease outcomes (35,43).\nThere are validated tools that can be\nused in assessing diabetes-speci\ufb01c distress\nin youth starting at age 8 years and in\ntheir parents/caregivers (36,46). Further-\nmore, the complexities of diabetes man-\nagement require ongoing parental\ninvolvement in care throughout child-\nhood with developmentally appropriate\nfamily teamwork between the growing\nchild/teen and parent in order to maintain\nengagement in self-management be-\nhaviors and to prevent deterioration\nin glycemia (47,48). It is appropriate to\ninquire about diabetes-speci\ufb01c family con-\n\ufb02ict during visits and to either help to ne-\ngotiate a plan for resolution or refer to\nan appropriate mental health professional\n(49). Such professionals can conduct\nfurther assessment and deliver evidence-\nbased behavioral interventions to support\ndevelopmentally appropriate, collabo-\nrative family involvement in diabetes\nself-management (50,51). Monitoring of\nsocial adjustment (peer relationships)\nand school performance can facilitate\nboth well-being and academic achieve-\nment (52). Elevated A1C is a risk factor\nfor underperformance at school and in-\ncreased absenteeism (53).\nShared decision-making with youth re-\ngarding the adoption of management\nplan components and self-management\nbehaviors can improve diabetes self-\nef\ufb01cacy, participation in diabetes care,\nand metabolic outcomes (26,54). Although\ncognitive abilities vary, the ethical posi-\ntion often adopted is the \u201cmature minor\nrule,\u201d whereby children after age 12\nor 13 years who appear to be \u201cmature\u201d\nhave the right to consent or withhold\nconsent to general medical treatment,\nexcept in cases in which refusal would\nsigni\ufb01cantly endanger health (55).\nBeginning at the onset of puberty or at\ndiagnosis of diabetes, all individuals with\nchildbearing potential should receive edu-\ncation about the risks of fetal malforma-\ntions associated with elevated A1C and\nthe use of effective contraception to pre-\nvent unplanned pregnancy. Preconcep-\ntion counseling using developmentally\nappropriate educational and behavioral\nstrategies enables individuals of child-\nbearing potential to make well-informed\ndecisions (56). Preconception counseling\nresources tailored for adolescents are\navailable at no cost through the ADA\n(57). Refer to the ADA position state-\nment \u201cPsychosocial Care for People With\nDiabetes\u201d for further details (43).\nYouth with type 1 diabetes have an\nincreased risk of disordered eating be-\nhavior as well as clinical eating disorders\nwith serious short-term and long-term\nnegative effects on diabetes outcomes\nand health in general. It is important to\nrecognize the unique and dangerous\ndisordered eating behavior of insulin\nomission for weight management in\ntype 1 diabetes (58) using tools such as\nthe Diabetes Eating Problems Survey-\nRevised (DEPS-R) to allow for early di-\nagnosis and intervention (45,59\u201361).\nGiven the complexity of treating dis-\nordered eating behaviors, collaboration\nbetween the diabetes health care team\nand a mental health professional, ideally\nwith expertise in disordered eating be-\nhaviors and diabetes, is recommended.\nThe presence of a mental health pro-\nfessional on pediatric multidisciplinary\nteams highlights the importance of at-\ntending to the psychosocial issues of\ndiabetes. These psychosocial factors are\nsigni\ufb01cantly related to self-management\ndif\ufb01culties, elevated A1C, reduced qual-\nity of life, and higher rates of acute and\nchronic diabetes complications.\nGlycemic Monitoring, Insulin\nDelivery, and Targets\nRecommendations\n14.18 All youth with type 1 diabetes\nshould monitor glucose levels\nmultiple times daily (up to\n6\u201310 times/day by blood glu-\ncose meter or continuous glu-\ncose monitoring), including prior\nto meals and snacks, at bed-\ntime, and as needed for safety\nin speci\ufb01c situations such as\nphysical activity, driving, or\nthe presence of symptoms of\nhypoglycemia.

B\n14.27 Continuous glucose monitoring\nmetrics derived from continu-\nous glucose monitor use over\nthe most recent 14 days (or\nlonger for youth with more\nglycemic variability), including\ntime in range (70\u2013180 mg/dL),\ntime below target (<70 and\n<54 mg/dL), and time above\ntarget (>180 and >250 mg/dL),\nare recommended to be used in\nconjunction with A1C whenever\npossible. E\nCurrent standards for diabetes manage-\nment re\ufb02ect the need to minimize hy-\nperglycemia as safely as possible. The\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT), which did not enroll children\n<13 years of age, demonstrated that\nnear normalization of blood glucose\nlevels was more dif\ufb01cult to achieve in\nadolescents than in adults. Nevertheless,\nthe increased use of basal-bolus regi-\nmens, insulin pumps, frequent blood\nglucose monitoring, CGM, automated\ninsulin delivery systems, goal setting, and\nimproved patient education has been as-\nsociated with more children and adoles-\ncents reaching the blood glucose targets\nrecommended by the ADA (62\u201364), par-\nticularly in families in which both the\nparents/caregivers and the child with\ndiabetes participate jointly to perform\nthe required diabetes-related tasks.\nLower A1C in adolescence and young\nadulthood is associated with a lower\nrisk and rate of microvascular and mac-\nrovascular complications (65\u201368) and\ndemonstrates the effects of metabolic\nmemory (69\u201372).\nIn addition, type 1 diabetes can be as-\nsociated with adverse effects on cogni-\ntion during childhood and adolescence\n(6,73\u201375), and neurocognitive imaging\ndifferences related to hyperglycemia in\nchildren provide another motivation for\nachieving glycemic targets (6). DKA has\nbeen shown to cause adverse effects on\nbrain development and function. Addi-\ntional factors (76\u201379) that contribute to\nadverse effects on brain development\nand function include young age, severe\nhypoglycemia at <6 years of age, and\nchronic hyperglycemia (80\u201382). However,\nmeticulous use of therapeutic modalities\nsuch as rapid- and long-acting insulin\nanalogs, technological advances (e.g.,\nCGM, sensor-augmented pump therapy,\nand automated insulin delivery systems),\nand intensive self-management educa-\ntion now make it more feasible to achieve\nglycemic goals while reducing the inci-\ndence of severe hypoglycemia (83\u2013106).\nPlease refer to Section 7, \u201cDiabetes\nTechnology,\u201d for more information on tech-\nnology to support people with diabetes.\nIn selecting individualized glycemic\ntargets, the long-term health bene\ufb01ts of\nachieving a lower A1C should be bal-\nanced against the risks of hypoglycemia\nand the developmental burdens of in-\ntensive treatment plans in youth (107).\nRecent data with newer devices and in-\nsulins indicate that the risk of hypogly-\ncemia with lower A1C is less than it was\nbefore (108\u2013117). Some data suggest\nthat there could be a threshold where\nlower A1C is associated with more hypo-\nglycemia (118,119); however, the con\ufb01-\ndence intervals were large, suggesting\ngreat variability. In addition, achieving\nlower A1C levels is likely facilitated by\nsetting lower\nA1C targets\n(120,121).\nLower goals may be possible during the\n\u201choneymoon\u201d phase of type 1 diabetes.\nSpecial consideration should be given to\nthe risk of hypoglycemia in young children\n(aged <6 years) who are often unable to\nrecognize, articulate, and/or manage hy-\npoglycemia.However, registry data indicate\nthat A1C targets can be achieved in chil-\ndren, including those aged <6 years, with-\nout increased risk of severe hypoglycemia\n(109,120). Recent data have demonstrated\nthat the use of real-time CGM lowered\nA1C and increased time in range in\nadolescents and young adults and, in\nchildren aged <8 years old, was asso-\nciated with a lower risk of hypoglyce-\nmia (122,123). Please refer to Section\n6, \u201cGlycemic Targets,\u201d for more infor-\nmation on glycemic assessment.\nA strong relationship exists between\nthe frequency of blood glucose monitor-\ning and glycemic management (84\u201386,\n124\u2013130). Glucose levels for all children\nand adolescents with type 1 diabetes\nshould be monitored multiple times\ndaily by blood glucose monitoring and/or\nCGM. In the U.S., real-time CGM is ap-\nproved for nonadjunctive use in children\naged 2 years and older and intermittently\nscanned CGM is approved for nonadjunc-\ntive use in children aged 4 years and\nolder. Parents/caregivers and youth should\nbe offered initial and ongoing education\nand support for CGM use. Behavioral sup-\nport may further improve ongoing CGM\nuse (123). Metrics derived from CGM in-\nclude percent time in target range, below\ntarget range, and above target range\n(131). While studies indicate a relationship\nbetween time in range and A1C (132,\n133), it is still uncertain what the ideal\ntarget time in range should be for chil-\ndren, and further studies are needed.\nS236\nChildren and Adolescents\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

B\nBecause of the increased frequency of\nother autoimmune diseases in type 1 dia-\nbetes, screening for thyroid dysfunction\nand celiac disease should be considered\n(134\u2013138). Periodic screening in asymp-\ntomatic individuals has been recom-\nmended, but the optimal frequency\nof screening is unclear.\nAlthough much less common than thy-\nroid dysfunction and celiac disease, other\nautoimmune conditions, such as Addison\ndisease (primary adrenal insuf\ufb01ciency),\nautoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune gas-\ntritis, dermatomyositis, and myasthenia\ngravis, occur more commonly in the pop-\nulation with type 1 diabetes than in the\ngeneral pediatric population and should\nbe assessed and monitored as clinically\nindicated. In addition, relatives of youth\nwith type 1 diabetes should be offered\ntesting for islet autoantibodies through\nresearch studies (e.g., TrialNet) and na-\ntional programs for early diagnosis of pre-\nclinical type 1 diabetes (stages 1 and 2).\nThyroid Disease\nRecommendations\n14.29 Consider testing children with\ntype 1 diabetes for antithyroid\nperoxidase and antithyroglo-\nbulin antibodies soon after\ndiagnosis. B\n14.30 Measure thyroid-stimulating\nhormone concentrations at di-\nagnosis when clinically stable\nor soon after optimizing glyce-\nmia. If normal, suggest recheck-\ning every 1\u20132 years or sooner\nif the youth has positive thyroid\nantibodies or develops symp-\ntoms or signs suggestive of\nthyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly,\nan abnormal growth rate, or un-\nexplained glycemic variability. B\nAutoimmune thyroid disease is the most\ncommon autoimmune disorder associ-\nated with diabetes, occurring in 17\u201330%\nof\nindividuals\nwith\ntype\n1\ndiabetes\n(135,139,140). At the time of diagnosis,\n\u000125% of children with type 1 diabetes\nhave thyroid autoantibodies (141), the\npresence of which is predictive of thyroid\ndysfunction\u2014most commonly hypothy-\nroidism, although hyperthyroidism occurs\nin \u00010.5% of people with type 1 diabetes\n(142,143). For thyroid autoantibodies, a\nstudy from Sweden indicated that anti-\nthyroid peroxidase antibodies were more\npredictive than antithyroglobulin antibod-\nies in multivariate analysis (144). Thyroid\nfunction tests may be misleading (euthy-\nroid sick syndrome) if performed at the\ntime of diagnosis owing to the effect of\nprevious hyperglycemia, ketosis or ke-\ntoacidosis, weight loss, etc. Therefore, if\nperformed at diagnosis and slightly ab-\nnormal, thyroid function tests should be\nrepeated soon after a period of meta-\nbolic stability and achievement of glyce-\nmic targets. Subclinical hypothyroidism\nmay be associated with an increased\nrisk of symptomatic hypoglycemia (145)\nand a reduced linear growth rate. Hy-\nperthyroidism alters glucose metabo-\nlism and usually causes deterioration of\nglycemia.\nCeliac Disease\nRecommendations\n14.31 Screen youth with type 1 dia-\nbetes for celiac disease by\nmeasuring IgA tissue trans-\nglutaminase (tTG) antibodies,\nwith documentation of nor-\nmal total serum IgA levels,\nsoon after the diagnosis of\ndiabetes, or IgG tTG and dea-\nmidated gliadin antibodies if\nIgA is de\ufb01cient. B\n14.32 Repeat screening within 2 years\nof diabetes diagnosis and then\nagain after 5 years and con-\nsider more frequent screening\nin youth who have symptoms\nor a \ufb01rst-degree relative with\nceliac disease. B\n14.33 Individuals with con\ufb01rmed ce-\nliac disease should be placed\non a gluten-free diet for treat-\nment and to avoid complica-\ntions; they should also have a\nconsultation with a registered\ndietitian nutritionist experienced\nin managing both diabetes and\nceliac disease. B\nCeliac disease is an immune-mediated\ndisorder that occurs with increased fre-\nquency in people with type 1 diabetes\n(1.6\u201316.4% of individuals compared with\n0.3\u20131% in the general population) (134,\n137,138,146\u2013150). Screening people with\ntype 1 diabetes for celiac disease is fur-\nther justi\ufb01ed by its association with oste-\noporosis, iron de\ufb01ciency, growth failure,\nand potential increased risk of retinopa-\nthy and albuminuria (151\u2013154).\nScreening for celiac disease includes\nmeasuring serum levels of IgA and tis-\nsue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibod-\nies, or, with IgA de\ufb01ciency, screening\ncan include measuring tTG IgG antibod-\nies or deamidated gliadin peptide IgG\nantibodies. Because most cases of celiac\ndisease are diagnosed within the \ufb01rst\n5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 dia-\nbetes, screening should be considered\nat the time of diagnosis and repeated at\n2 and then 5 years (148) or if clinical\nsymptoms indicate, such as poor growth\nor increased hypoglycemia (149,151).\nAlthough celiac disease can be diag-\nnosed more than 10 years after diabe-\ntes diagnosis, there are insuf\ufb01cient data\nafter 5 years to determine the optimal\nscreening frequency. Measurement of\ntTG antibody should be considered at\nother times in individuals with symp-\ntoms suggestive of celiac disease (148).\nMonitoring for symptoms should include\nan assessment of linear growth and\nweight gain (149,151).

European guidelines on screening\nfor celiac disease in children (not speci\ufb01c\nto children with type 1 diabetes) suggest\nthat biopsy may not be necessary in\nsymptomatic children with high anti-\nbody titers (i.e., greater than 10 times\nthe upper limit of normal) provided that\nfurther testing is performed (veri\ufb01cation\nof endomysial antibody positivity on a\nseparate blood sample) (156). Whether\nthis approach may be appropriate for\nasymptomatic children in high-risk groups\nremains an open question, though evi-\ndence is emerging (157). It is also advis-\nable to check for celiac disease-associated\nHLA types in patients who are diagnosed\nwithout a small intestinal biopsy. In symp-\ntomatic children with type 1 diabetes and\ncon\ufb01rmed celiac disease, gluten-free diets\nreduce symptoms and rates of hypoglyce-\nmia (158). The challenging dietary restric-\ntions associated with having both type 1\ndiabetes and celiac disease place a signi\ufb01-\ncant burden on individuals. Therefore, a\nbiopsy to con\ufb01rm the diagnosis of celiac\ndisease is recommended, especially in\nasymptomatic children, before establish-\ning a diagnosis of celiac disease (159) and\nendorsing signi\ufb01cant dietary changes. A\ngluten-free diet was bene\ufb01cial in asymp-\ntomatic adults with positive antibodies\ncon\ufb01rmed by biopsy (160).\nManagement of Cardiovascular Risk\nFactors\nHypertension Screening\nRecommendation\n14.34 Blood pressure should be mea-\nsured at every routine visit. In\nyouth with high blood pressure\n(blood pressure $90th percen-\ntile for age, sex, and height or,\nin adolescents aged $13 years,\nblood pressure $120/80 mmHg)\non three separate measure-\nments, ambulatory blood pres-\nsure monitoring should be\nstrongly considered. B\nHypertension Treatment\nRecommendations\n14.35 Treatment of elevated blood\npressure (de\ufb01ned as 90th to\n<95th percentile for age, sex,\nand height or, in adolescents\naged $13 years, 120\u2013129/\n<80 mmHg) is lifestyle modi-\n\ufb01cation\nfocused\non\nhealthy\nnutrition, physical activity, sleep,\nand, if appropriate, weight\nmanagement. C\n14.36 In addition to lifestyle mod-\ni\ufb01cation, ACE inhibitors or\nangiotensin receptor blockers\nshould be started for treat-\nment of con\ufb01rmed hyperten-\nsion (de\ufb01ned as blood pressure\nconsistently $95th percentile\nfor age, sex, and height or, in\nadolescents aged $13 years,\n$130/80 mmHg). Due to the\npotential teratogenic effects,\nindividuals of childbearing age\nshould receive reproductive\ncounseling, and ACE inhibitors\nand angiotensin receptor block-\ners should be avoided in indi-\nviduals of childbearing age\nwho are not using reliable\ncontraception. B\n14.37 The goal of treatment is blood\npressure <90th percentile for\nage, sex, and height or, in ado-\nlescents\naged\n$13\nyears,\n<130/80 mmHg. C\nBlood pressure measurements should\nbe performed using the appropriate size\ncuff with the youth seated and relaxed.\nElevated blood pressure should be con-\n\ufb01rmed on at least three separate days,\nand ambulatory blood pressure moni-\ntoring should be considered. Evaluation\nshould proceed as clinically indicated\n(161,162). Treatment is generally initi-\nated with an ACE inhibitor, but an an-\ngiotensin receptor blocker can be used\nif the ACE inhibitor is not tolerated\n(e.g., due to cough) (163).\nDyslipidemia Screening\nRecommendations\n14.38 Initial lipid pro\ufb01le should be\nperformed soon after diagno-\nsis, preferably after glycemia\nhas improved and age is $2\nyears. If initial LDL cholesterol\nis #100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L),\nsubsequent testing should be\nperformed at 9\u201311 years of\nage. B Initial testing may be\ndone with a nonfasting lipid\nlevel with con\ufb01rmatory test-\ning with a fasting lipid panel.\n14.39 If LDL cholesterol values are\nwithin the accepted risk level\n(<100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]),\na lipid pro\ufb01le repeated every\n3 years is reasonable. E\nDyslipidemia Treatment\nRecommendations\n14.40 If lipids are abnormal, initial\ntherapy should consist of op-\ntimizing glycemia and medical\nnutrition therapy to limit the\namount of calories from fat\nto 25\u201330% and saturated fat\nto <7%, limit cholesterol to\n<200 mg/day, avoid trans\nfats, and aim for \u000110% cal-\nories from monounsaturated\nfats. A\n14.41 After the age of 10 years, ad-\ndition of a statin may be con-\nsidered in youth with type 1\ndiabetes who, despite medical\nnutrition therapy and lifestyle\nchanges, continue to have\nLDL cholesterol >160 mg/dL\n(4.1 mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol\n>130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and\none or more cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors. E Due to\nthe potential teratogenic effects,\nindividuals of childbearing age\nshould receive reproductive\ncounseling, and statins should\nbe avoided in individuals of\nchildbearing age who are not\nusing reliable contraception. B\n14.42 The goal of therapy is an LDL\ncholesterol value <100 mg/dL\n(2.6 mmol/L). E\nPopulation-based studies estimate that\n14\u201345% of children with type 1 diabetes\nhave two or more atherosclerotic car-\ndiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors\n(164\u2013166), and the prevalence of car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in-\ncrease with age (166) and among racial/\nethnic minorities (25), with girls having\na higher risk burden than boys (165).\nPathophysiology. The atherosclerotic pro-\ncess begins in childhood, and although\nASCVD events are not expected to occur\nduring childhood, observations using a va-\nriety of methodologies show that youth\nwith type 1 diabetes may have subclinical\nCVD within the \ufb01rst decade of diagnosis\n(167\u2013169).

Lipid evaluation for these patients\ncontributes to risk assessment and identi-\n\ufb01es an important proportion of those with\ndyslipidemia. Therefore, initial screening\nshould be done soon after diagnosis. If\nthe initial screen is normal, subsequent\nscreening may be done at 9\u201311 years of\nage, which is a stable time for lipid as-\nsessment in children (170). Children with\na primary lipid disorder (e.g., familial hy-\nperlipidemia) should be referred to a lipid\nspecialist. Non-HDL cholesterol level has\nbeen identi\ufb01ed as a signi\ufb01cant predictor\nof the presence of atherosclerosis\u2014as\npowerful as any other lipoprotein choles-\nterol measure in children and adoles-\ncents. For both children and adults, non-\nHDL cholesterol level seems to be more\npredictive of persistent dyslipidemia\nand, therefore, atherosclerosis and fu-\nture events than total cholesterol, LDL\ncholesterol, or HDL cholesterol levels\nalone. A major advantage of non-HDL\ncholesterol is that it can be accurately\ncalculated in a nonfasting state and\ntherefore is practical to obtain in clini-\ncal practice as a screening test (171).\nYouth with type 1 diabetes have a\nhigh prevalence of lipid abnormalities\n(164,172).\nEven if normal, screening should be\nrepeated within 3 years, as A1C and\nother cardiovascular risk factors can\nchange dramatically during adolescence\n(173).\nTreatment. Pediatric lipid guidelines pro-\nvide some guidance relevant to children\nwith type 1 diabetes and secondary dys-\nlipidemia (162,170,174,175); however,\nthere are few studies on modifying lipid\nlevels in children with type 1 diabetes.\nA 6-month trial of dietary counseling\nproduced a signi\ufb01cant improvement in\nlipid levels (176); likewise, a lifestyle in-\ntervention trial with 6 months of exercise\nin adolescents demonstrated improve-\nment in lipid levels (177). Data from the\nSEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH)\nstudy show that improved glucose over a\n2-year period is associated with a more\nfavorable lipid pro\ufb01le; however, improved\nglycemia alone will not normalize lipids\nin youth with type 1 diabetes and dyslipi-\ndemia (173).\nAlthough intervention data are sparse,\nthe American Heart Association catego-\nrizes children with type 1 diabetes in the\nhighest tier for cardiovascular risk and\nrecommends both lifestyle and pharma-\ncologic treatment for those with elevated\nLDL cholesterol levels (175,178). Initial\ntherapy should include a nutrition plan\nthat restricts saturated fat to 7% of total\ncalories and dietary cholesterol to\n200 mg/day (170). Data from random-\nized clinical trials in children as young as\n7 months of age indicate that this diet is\nsafe and does not interfere with normal\ngrowth and development (179).\nNeither long-term safety nor cardio-\nvascular outcome ef\ufb01cacy of statin ther-\napy has been established for children;\nhowever, studies have shown short-term\nsafety equivalent to that seen in adults\nand ef\ufb01cacy in lowering LDL cholesterol\nlevels in familial hypercholesterolemia or\nsevere hyperlipidemia, improving endo-\nthelial function and causing regression of\ncarotid intimal thickening (180,181). Sta-\ntins are not approved for children aged\n<10 years, and statin treatment should\ngenerally not be used in children with\ntype 1 diabetes before this age. Statins\nare contraindicated in pregnancy; there-\nfore, the prevention of unplanned preg-\nnancies is of paramount importance.\nStatins should be avoided in individuals\nof childbearing age who are not using\nreliable contraception (see Section 15,\n\u201cManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy,\u201d\nfor more information). The multicenter,\nrandomized, placebo-controlled Adoles-\ncent Type 1 Diabetes Cardio-Renal Inter-\nvention Trial (AdDIT) provides safety data\non pharmacologic treatment with an ACE\ninhibitor and statin in adolescents with\ntype 1 diabetes (162).\nSmoking\nRecommendations\n14.43 Elicit a smoking history at ini-\ntial and follow-up diabetes\nvisits; discourage smoking in\nyouth who do not smoke and\nencourage smoking cessation\nin those who do smoke. A\n14.44 Electronic cigarette use should\nbe discouraged. A\nThe adverse health effects of smoking\nare well recognized with respect to fu-\nture cancer and CVD risk. Despite this,\nsmoking rates are signi\ufb01cantly higher\namong youth with diabetes than among\nyouth without diabetes (182,183). In\nyouth with diabetes, it is important to\navoid additional CVD risk factors. Smok-\ning increases the risk of the onset of al-\nbuminuria; therefore, smoking avoidance\nis important to prevent both microvas-\ncular and macrovascular complications\n(170,184). Discouraging cigarette smok-\ning, including electronic cigarettes (185,\n186), is an important part of routine dia-\nbetes care. In light of CDC evidence of\ndeaths related to electronic cigarette use\n(187,188), no individuals should be ad-\nvised to use electronic cigarettes, either\nas a way to stop smoking tobacco or\nas a recreational drug. In younger chil-\ndren, it is important to assess exposure\nto cigarette smoke in the home because\nof the adverse effects of secondhand\nsmoke and to discourage youth from ever\nsmoking.\nMicrovascular Complications\nNephropathy Screening\nRecommendation\n14.45 Annual screening for albumin-\nuria with a random (morning\nsample preferred to avoid\neffects of exercise) spot urine\nsample for albumin-to-creatinine\nratio should be considered at\npuberty or at age >10 years,\nwhichever is earlier, once the\nchild has had diabetes for\n5 years.

B\nData from 7,549 participants <20 years\nof age in the T1D Exchange clinic registry\nemphasize the importance of meeting\nglycemic and blood pressure goals, par-\nticularly as diabetes duration increases,\nin order to reduce the risk of diabetic kid-\nney disease. The data also underscore\nthe importance of routine screening to\nensure early diagnosis and timely treat-\nment of albuminuria (189). An estimation\nof glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR), cal-\nculated using GFR estimating equations\nfrom the serum creatinine, height, age,\nand sex (190), should be considered at\nbaseline and repeated as indicated based\non clinical status, age, diabetes duration,\nand therapies. Improved methods are\nneeded to screen for early GFR loss\nsince estimated GFR is inaccurate at\nGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (190,191). The\nAdDIT study in adolescents with type 1\ndiabetes demonstrated the safety of ACE\ninhibitor treatment, but the treatment\ndid not change the albumin-to-creatinine\nratio over the course of the study (162).\nRetinopathy\nRecommendations\n14.47 An initial dilated and compre-\nhensive eye examination is rec-\nommended once youth have\nhad type 1 diabetes for 3\u20135\nyears, provided they are aged\n$11 years or puberty has\nstarted, whichever is earlier. B\n14.48 After the initial examination, re-\npeat dilated and comprehensive\neye examination every 2 years.\nLess frequent examinations, ev-\nery 4 years, may be acceptable\non the advice of an eye care\nprofessional and based on risk\nfactor assessment, including a\nhistory of A1C <8%. B\n14.49 Programs that use retinal pho-\ntography (with remote reading\nor use of a validated assess-\nment tool) to improve access to\ndiabetic retinopathy screening\ncan be appropriate screening\nstrategies for diabetic retinopa-\nthy. Such programs need to\nprovide pathways for timely re-\nferral for a comprehensive eye\nexamination when indicated. E\nRetinopathy (like albuminuria) most\ncommonly occurs after the onset of pu-\nberty and after 5\u201310 years of diabetes\nduration (192). It is currently recognized\nthat there is a low risk of development of\nvision-threatening retinal lesions prior to\n12 years of age (193,194). A 2019 publi-\ncation based on the follow-up of the\nDCCT adolescent cohort supports a lower\nfrequency of eye examinations than pre-\nviously recommended, particularly in\nadolescents with A1C closer to the target\nrange (195,196). Referrals should be\nmade to eye care professionals with ex-\npertise in diabetic retinopathy and experi-\nence in counseling pediatric patients and\nfamilies on the importance of prevention,\nearly detection, and intervention.\nNeuropathy\nRecommendation\n14.50 Consider an annual comprehen-\nsive foot exam at the start of\npuberty or at age $10 years,\nwhichever is earlier, once the\nyouth has had type 1 diabetes\nfor 5 years. The examination\nshould include inspection, as-\nsessment of foot pulses, pin-\nprick, and 10-g mono\ufb01lament\nsensation tests, testing of\nvibration sensation using a\n128-Hz tuning fork, and ankle\nre\ufb02ex tests. B\nDiabetic neuropathy rarely occurs in pre-\npubertal children or after only 1\u20132 years\nof diabetes (192), although data suggest\na prevalence of distal peripheral neuropa-\nthy of 7% in 1,734 youth with type 1 dia-\nbetes and association with the presence\nof CVD risk factors (197,198). A compre-\nhensive foot exam, including inspection,\npalpation of dorsalis pedis and posterior\ntibial pulses, and determination of propri-\noception, vibration, and mono\ufb01lament\nsensation, should be performed annually\nalong with an assessment of symptoms\nof neuropathic pain (198). Foot inspec-\ntion can be performed at each visit to ed-\nucate youth regarding the importance of\nfoot care (see Section 12, \u201cRetinopathy,\nNeuropathy, and Foot Care\u201d).\nTYPE 2 DIABETES\nFor information on risk-based screening\nfor type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in chil-\ndren and adolescents, please refer to\nSection 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of\nDiabetes.\u201d For additional support for these\nrecommendations, see the ADA position\nstatement \u201cEvaluation and Management\nof Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\u201d (3).\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes in\nyouth has continued to increase over\nthe past 20 years (4). The CDC published\nprojections for type 2 diabetes prevalence\nusing the SEARCH database; assuming a\n2.3% annual increase, the prevalence in\nthose under 20 years of age will quadru-\nple in 40 years (199,200).\nEvidence suggests that type 2 diabe-\ntes in youth is different not only from\ntype 1 diabetes but also from type 2 dia-\nbetes in adults and has unique features,\nsuch as a more rapidly progressive de-\ncline in b-cell function and accelerated\ndevelopment of diabetes complications\n(3,201). Long-term follow-up data from\nthe Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabe-\ntes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY)\nstudy showed that a majority of individu-\nals with type 2 diabetes diagnosed as\nyouth had microvascular complications\nby young adulthood (202). Type 2 diabe-\ntes disproportionately impacts youth of\nethnic and racial minorities and can oc-\ncur in complex psychosocial and cultural\nenvironments, which may make it dif\ufb01cult\nto sustain healthy lifestyle changes and\nself-management behaviors (26,203\u2013206).\nAdditional risk factors associated with\ntype 2 diabetes in youth include adiposity,\nfamily history of diabetes, female sex,\nand low socioeconomic status (201).\nAs with type 1 diabetes, youth with\ntype 2 diabetes spend much of the day\nin school. Therefore, close communica-\ntion with and the cooperation of school\npersonnel are essential for optimal dia-\nbetes management, safety, and maximal\nacademic opportunities.\nScreening and Diagnosis\nRecommendations\n14.51 Risk-based screening for predi-\nabetes and/or type 2 diabetes\nshould be considered after the\nonset of puberty or $10 years\nof age, whichever occurs ear-\nlier, in youth with overweight\n(BMI $85th percentile) or obe-\nsity (BMI $95th percentile)\nand who have one or more ad-\nditional risk factors for diabetes\n(see Table 2.4 for evidence\ngrading of other risk factors).\nS240\nChildren and Adolescents\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

C\n14.53 Fasting plasma glucose, 2-h\nplasma glucose during a 75-g\noral\nglucose\ntolerance\ntest,\nand A1C can be used to test\nfor prediabetes or diabetes in\nchildren and adolescents. B\n14.54 Children and adolescents with\noverweight or obesity in whom\nthe diagnosis of type 2 diabetes\nis being considered should have\na panel of pancreatic autoanti-\nbodies tested to exclude the\npossibility of autoimmune type 1\ndiabetes. B\nIn the last decade, the incidence and prev-\nalence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents\nhas increased dramatically, especially in ra-\ncial and ethnic minority populations (170,\n207). A few studies suggest oral glucose\ntolerance tests or fasting plasma glucose\nvalues as more suitable diagnostic tests\nthan A1C in the pediatric population, es-\npecially among certain ethnicities (208), al-\nthough fasting glucose alone may over-\ndiagnose diabetes in children (209,210). In\naddition, many of these studies do not rec-\nognize that diabetes diagnostic criteria are\nbased on long-term health outcomes, and\nvalidations are not currently available in\nthe pediatric population (211). An analysis\nof National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) data suggests using\nA1C for screening of high-risk youth (212).\nThe ADA acknowledges the limited\ndata supporting A1C for diagnosing type 2\ndiabetes in children and adolescents. Al-\nthough A1C is not recommended for diag-\nnosis of diabetes in children with cystic\n\ufb01brosis or symptoms suggestive of acute\nonset of type 1 diabetes, and only A1C as-\nsays without interference are appropriate\nfor children with hemoglobinopathies, the\nADA continues to recommend A1C for di-\nagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this popula-\ntion (213,214).\nDiagnostic Challenges\nGiven the current obesity epidemic, dis-\ntinguishing between type 1 and type 2\ndiabetes in children can be dif\ufb01cult.\nOverweight and obesity are common in\nchildren with type 1 diabetes (27), and\ndiabetes-associated autoantibodies and\nketosis may be present in pediatric indi-\nviduals with clinical features of type 2\ndiabetes (including obesity and acantho-\nsis nigricans) (209). The presence of islet\nautoantibodies\nhas\nbeen\nassociated\nwith faster progression to insulin de\ufb01-\nciency (209). At the onset, DKA occurs\nin \u00016% of youth aged 10\u201319 years with\ntype 2 diabetes (215). Although uncom-\nmon, type 2 diabetes has been ob-\nserved in prepubertal children under\nthe age of 10 years, and thus it should\nbe part of the differential in children\nwith suggestive symptoms (216). Finally,\nobesity contributes to the development\nof type 1 diabetes in some individuals\n(217), which further blurs the lines be-\ntween diabetes types. However, accu-\nrate diagnosis is critical, as treatment\nplans, educational approaches, dietary\nadvice, and outcomes differ markedly\nbetween patients with the two diag-\nnoses. The signi\ufb01cant diagnostic dif\ufb01cul-\nties posed by MODY are discussed in\nSection 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of\nDiabetes.\u201d In addition, there are rare and\natypical diabetes cases that represent a\nchallenge for clinicians and researchers.\nManagement\nLifestyle Management\nRecommendations\n14.55 All youth with type 2 diabe-\ntes and their families should\nreceive comprehensive dia-\nbetes self-management edu-\ncation and support that is\nspeci\ufb01c to youth with type 2\ndiabetes\nand\nis\nculturally\nappropriate. B\n14.56 Youth with overweight/obe-\nsity and type 2 diabetes and\ntheir families should be pro-\nvided with developmentally and\nculturally appropriate compre-\nhensive lifestyle programs that\nare integrated with diabetes\nmanagement to achieve a\n7\u201310% decrease in excess\nweight. C\n14.57 Given the necessity of long-\nterm weight management for\nyouth with type 2 diabetes,\nlifestyle intervention should\nbe based on a chronic care\nmodel\nand offered in the\ncontext of diabetes care. E\n14.58 Youth with prediabetes and\ntype 2 diabetes, like all children\nand adolescents, should be\nencouraged to participate in\nat least 60 min of moderate to\nvigorous physical activity daily\n(with muscle and bone strength\ntraining at least 3 days/week) B\nand to decrease sedentary\nbehavior. C\n14.59 Nutrition for youth with pre-\ndiabetes and type 2 diabetes,\nlike for all children and adoles-\ncents, should focus on healthy\neating patterns that emphasize\nconsumption of nutrient-dense,\nhigh-quality foods and decreased\nconsumption of calorie-dense,\nnutrient-poor foods, particularly\nsugar-added beverages.

A\n14.67 In individuals with incidentally\ndiagnosed\nor\nmetabolically\nstable diabetes (A1C <8.5%\n[69 mmol/mol] and asymp-\ntomatic), metformin is the ini-\ntial pharmacologic treatment\nof choice if renal function is\nnormal. A\n14.68 Youth with marked hyperglyce-\nmia (blood glucose $250 mg/dL\n[13.9 mmol/L], A1C $8.5%\n[69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis\nat diagnosis who are symptom-\natic with polyuria, polydipsia,\nnocturia, and/or weight loss\nshould be treated initially with\nlong-acting insulin while metfor-\nmin is initiated and titrated. B\n14.69 In individuals with ketosis/ketoa-\ncidosis, treatment with subcu-\ntaneous or intravenous insulin\nshould be initiated to rapidly\ncorrect the hyperglycemia and\nthe metabolic derangement.\nOnce acidosis is resolved, met-\nformin should be initiated while\nsubcutaneous insulin therapy is\ncontinued. A\n14.70 In individuals presenting with\nsevere hyperglycemia (blood\nglucose $600 mg/dL [33.3\nmmol/L]), consider assessment\nfor hyperglycemic hyperosmolar\nnonketotic syndrome. A\n14.71 If glycemic targets are no lon-\nger met with metformin (with\nor without long-acting insulin),\nglucagon-like peptide 1 recep-\ntor agonist therapy approved\nfor youth with type 2 diabetes\nshould be considered in chil-\ndren 10 years of age or older if\nthey have no past medical his-\ntory or family history of medul-\nlary\nthyroid\ncarcinoma\nor\nmultiple\nendocrine\nneoplasia\ntype 2. A\n14.72 Individuals treated with metfor-\nmin, a glucagon-like peptide 1\nreceptor agonist, and long-\nacting insulin who do not meet\nglycemic targets should be\nmoved to multiple daily injec-\ntions with long-acting and pran-\ndial insulins or insulin pump\ntherapy. E\n14.73 In individuals initially treated\nwith insulin and metformin\nwho are meeting glucose tar-\ngets based on blood glucose\nmonitoring,\ninsulin\ncan\nbe\ntapered over 2\u20136 weeks by\ndecreasing the insulin dose\n10\u201330% every few days. B\n14.74 Use of medications not ap-\nproved by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration for youth\nwith type 2 diabetes is not\nrecommended outside of re-\nsearch trials. B\nTreatment of youth-onset type 2 diabetes\nshould include lifestyle management, dia-\nbetes self-management education and\nsupport, and pharmacologic treatment.\nInitial treatment of youth with obesity\nand diabetes must take into account that\ndiabetes type is often uncertain in the\n\ufb01rst few weeks of treatment due to over-\nlap in presentation and that a substantial\npercentage of youth with type 2 diabetes\nwill present with clinically signi\ufb01cant ke-\ntoacidosis (218). Therefore, initial therapy\nshould address the hyperglycemia and\nassociated metabolic derangements ir-\nrespective of ultimate diabetes type,\nwith adjustment of therapy once meta-\nbolic compensation has been established\nand subsequent information, such as\nislet autoantibody results, becomes\navailable. Figure 14.1 provides an ap-\nproach to the initial treatment of new-\nonset diabetes in youth with overweight\nor obesity with clinical suspicion of\ntype 2 diabetes.\nGlycemic targets should be individual-\nized, taking into consideration the long-\nterm health bene\ufb01ts of more stringent\ntargets and risk for adverse effects, such\nas hypoglycemia. A lower target A1C in\nyouth with type 2 diabetes when com-\npared with those recommended in type 1\ndiabetes is justi\ufb01ed by a lower risk of\nhypoglycemia and higher risk of compli-\ncations (202,219\u2013222).\nSelf-management in pediatric diabe-\ntes involves both the youth and their\nparents/adult caregivers. Individuals and\ntheir families should receive education\nand support for healthful nutrition and\nphysical activity such as a balanced meal\nplan, achieving and maintaining a healthy\nweight, and regular physical activity. Phys-\nical activity should include aerobic, mus-\ncle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening\nactivities (17). A family-centered approach\nto nutrition and lifestyle modi\ufb01cation is\nessential in children and adolescents with\ntype 2 diabetes, and nutrition recom-\nmendations should be culturally appro-\npriate and sensitive to family resources\n(see Section 5, \u201cFacilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to Improve\nHealth Outcomes\u201d). Given the complex\nsocial and environmental context sur-\nrounding youth with type 2 diabetes,\nindividual-level lifestyle interventions\nmay not be suf\ufb01cient to target the\ncomplex interplay of family dynamics,\nmental health, community readiness,\nand the broader environmental sys-\ntem (3).\nA multidisciplinary diabetes team,\nincluding a physician, diabetes care\nand education specialist, registered di-\netitian nutritionist, and psychologist\nor social worker, is essential. In addition\nto achieving glycemic targets and self-\nmanagement education (223\u2013225), ini-\ntial treatment must include manage-\nment of comorbidities such as obesity,\ndyslipidemia, hypertension, and micro-\nvascular complications.\nCurrent pharmacologic treatment op-\ntions for youth-onset type 2 diabetes are\nlimited to three approved drugs classes:\ninsulin,\nmetformin,\nand\nglucagon-like\npeptide 1 receptor agonists. Presenta-\ntion with ketoacidosis or marked ketosis\nrequires a period of insulin therapy until\nfasting and postprandial glycemia have\nbeen restored to normal or near-normal\nlevels.

A\nThe results of weight loss and lifestyle in-\nterventions for obesity in children and\nadolescents\nhave\nbeen\ndisappointing,\nand treatment options as adjuncts to life-\nstyle therapy are limited. Recent U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration\u2013approved\nmedications for youth ages 12 and older\ninclude phentermine and topiramate ex-\ntended-release capsules and liraglutide\n(234\u2013236). Over the last decade, weight\nloss surgery has been increasingly per-\nformed in adolescents with obesity. Small\nretrospective analyses and a prospective\nmulticenter, nonrandomized study sug-\ngest that bariatric or metabolic surgery\nmay have bene\ufb01ts in adolescents with\nobesity and type 2 diabetes similar to\nthose observed in adults. Teenagers ex-\nperience similar degrees of weight loss,\ndiabetes remission, and improvement of\ncardiometabolic risk factors for at least\n3 years after surgery (237). A secondary\ndata analysis from the Teen-Longitudinal\nAssessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-\nLABS) and TODAY studies suggests surgi-\ncal treatment of adolescents with severe\nobesity and type 2 diabetes is associated\nwith improved glycemia (238); however,\nno randomized trials have yet compared\nthe effectiveness and safety of surgery\nto those of conventional treatment op-\ntions in adolescents (239). The guidelines\nused as an indication for metabolic\nsurgery in adolescents generally include\nBMI >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities or\nBMI >40 kg/m2 with or without comor-\nbidities (240\u2013251). A number of groups,\nincluding the Pediatric Bariatric Study\nGroup and Teen-LABS study, have dem-\nonstrated the effectiveness of metabolic\nsurgery in adolescents (244\u2013250).\nPrevention and Management of\nDiabetes Complications\nHypertension\nRecommendations\n14.77 Blood pressure should be mea-\nsured at every visit. In youth\nwith high blood pressure (blood\npressure $90th percentile\nfor age, sex, and height or, in\nadolescents aged $13 years,\n$120/80 mmHg) on three sepa-\nrate measurements, ambulatory\nblood pressure monitoring should\nbe strongly considered. B\n14.78 Treatment of elevated blood\npressure (de\ufb01ned as 90th to\n<95th percentile for age, sex,\nand height or, in adolescents\naged\n$13\nyears,\n120\u2013129/\n<80 mmHg) is lifestyle modi\ufb01-\ncation focused on healthy nu-\ntrition, physical activity, sleep,\nand,\nif\nappropriate,\nweight\nmanagement. C\n14.79 In addition to lifestyle modi\ufb01ca-\ntion, ACE inhibitors or angioten-\nsin receptor blockers should be\nstarted for treatment of con-\n\ufb01rmed hypertension (de\ufb01ned\nas blood pressure consistently\n$95th percentile for age, sex,\nand height or, in adolescents\naged $13 years, $130/80\nmmHg). Due to the potential\nteratogenic effects, individuals\nof childbearing age should re-\nceive reproductive counseling,\nand ACE inhibitors and angio-\ntensin receptor blockers should\nbe avoided in individuals of\nchildbearing age who are not\nusing reliable contraception. B\n14.80 The goal of treatment is blood\npressure <90th percentile\nfor age, sex, and height or, in\nadolescents aged $13 years,\n<130/80 mmHg. C\nNephropathy\nRecommendations\n14.81 Protein intake should be at\nthe recommended daily al-\nlowance of 0.8 g/kg/day. E\n14.82 Urine albumin-to-creatinine\nratio should be obtained at\nthe time of diagnosis and an-\nnually thereafter. An elevated\nurine albumin-to-creatinine ratio\n(>30 mg/g creatinine) should\nbe con\ufb01rmed on two of three\nsamples. B\n14.83 Estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration\nrate should be determined at\nthe time of diagnosis and an-\nnually thereafter. E\n14.84 In youth with diabetes and\nhypertension, either an ACE in-\nhibitor or an angiotensin recep-\ntor blocker is recommended for\nthose with modestly elevated\nurinary albumin-to-creatinine\nratio\n(30\u2013299\nmg/g creati-\nnine) and is strongly recom-\nmended\nfor\nthose\nwith\nurinary albumin-to-creatinine\nratio >300 mg/g creatinine\nand/or estimated glomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate <60 mL/min/\n1.73 m2. E Due to the potential\nteratogenic effects, individuals\nof childbearing age should re-\nceive reproductive counseling,\nand ACE inhibitors and angio-\ntensin receptor blockers should\nbe avoided in individuals of\nchildbearing age who are not\nusing reliable contraception. B\n14.85 For those with nephropathy,\ncontinued monitoring (yearly\nurinary albumin-to-creatinine\nratio,\nestimated\nglomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate, and serum po-\ntassium) may aid in assessing\nengagement and detecting pro-\ngression of disease. E\n14.86 Referral to nephrology is recom-\nmended in case of uncertainty\nof etiology, worsening urinary al-\nbumin-to-creatinine ratio, or de-\ncrease in estimated glomerular\n\ufb01ltration rate.

E\nDyslipidemia\nRecommendations\n14.100 Lipid screening should be\nperformed initially after op-\ntimizing glycemia and annu-\nally thereafter. B\n14.101 Optimal goals are LDL choles-\nterol <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L),\nHDL cholesterol >35 mg/dL\n(0.91 mmol/L), and triglycerides\n<150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L). E\n14.102 If lipids are abnormal, initial\ntherapy should consist of op-\ntimizing glycemia and medi-\ncal\nnutritional\ntherapy\nto\nlimit the amount of calories\nfrom fat to 25\u201330% and sat-\nurated fat to <7%, limit cho-\nlesterol\nto\n<200\nmg/day,\navoid trans fats, and aim for\n\u000110% calories from mono-\nunsaturated fats for elevated\nLDL. For elevated triglycer-\nides, medical nutrition ther-\napy should also focus on\ndecreasing simple sugar in-\ntake and increasing dietary\nn-3 fatty acids in addition to\nthe above changes.

C\nCardiac Function Testing\nRecommendation\n14.105 Routine screening for heart\ndisease with electrocardio-\ngram, echocardiogram, or\nstress testing is not recom-\nmended in asymptomatic\nyouth with type 2 diabetes. B\nComorbidities may already be present\nat the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabe-\ntes in youth (201,252). Therefore, blood\npressure measurement, a fasting lipid\npanel, assessment of random urine al-\nbumin-to-creatinine ratio, and a dilated\neye examination should be performed\nat diagnosis. Additional medical condi-\ntions that may need to be addressed in-\nclude polycystic ovary disease and other\ncomorbidities associated with pediatric\nobesity, such as sleep apnea, hepatic\nsteatosis, orthopedic complications, and\npsychosocial concerns. The ADA position\nstatement\n\u201cEvaluation\nand\nManage-\nment of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes\u201d\n(3) provides guidance on the preven-\ntion, screening, and treatment of type 2\ndiabetes and its comorbidities in chil-\ndren and adolescents.\nYouth-onset type 2 diabetes is associ-\nated with signi\ufb01cant microvascular and\nmacrovascular risk burden and a sub-\nstantial increase in the risk of cardiovas-\ncular morbidity and mortality at an\nearlier age than in those diagnosed later\nin life (202,253). The higher complica-\ntion risk in earlier-onset type 2 diabetes\nis likely related to prolonged lifetime ex-\nposure to hyperglycemia and other ath-\nerogenic risk factors, including insulin\nresistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension,\nand chronic in\ufb02ammation. There is a\nlow risk of hypoglycemia in youth with\ntype 2 diabetes, even if they are being\ntreated with insulin (254), and there are\nhigh rates of complications (219\u2013222).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nChildren and Adolescents\nS245\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

In addition,\nthe progression of vascular abnormali-\nties appears to be more pronounced in\nyouth-onset type 2 diabetes than with\ntype 1 diabetes of similar duration, in-\ncluding ischemic heart disease and stroke\n(255).\nPsychosocial Factors\nRecommendations\n14.106 Health care professionals\nshould screen for food inse-\ncurity, housing instability/\nhomelessness, health literacy,\n\ufb01nancial barriers, and social/\ncommunity support and apply\nthat information to treatment\ndecisions. E\n14.107 Use\nage-appropriate\nstan-\ndardized and validated tools\nto screen for diabetes dis-\ntress, depressive symptoms,\nand mental/behavioral health\nin youth with type 2 diabetes,\nwith attention to symptoms\nof depression and disordered\neating, and refer to a quali-\n\ufb01ed\nmental\nhealth\nprofes-\nsional when indicated. B\n14.108 When\nchoosing\nglucose-\nlowering or other medica-\ntions for youth with over-\nweight or obesity and type 2\ndiabetes, consider medication-\ntaking behavior and the medi-\ncations\u2019 effect on weight. E\n14.109 Starting at puberty, precon-\nception counseling should\nbe incorporated into routine\ndiabetes clinic visits for all\nindividuals of childbearing po-\ntential because of the adverse\npregnancy outcomes in this\npopulation. A\n14.110 Adolescents and young adults\nshould be screened for to-\nbacco,\nelectronic cigarettes,\nand alcohol use at diagnosis\nand regularly thereafter. C\nMost youth with type 2 diabetes come\nfrom racial/ethnic minority groups, have\nlow socioeconomic status, and often ex-\nperience multiple psychosocial stressors\n(26,43,205,206). Consideration of the\nsociocultural context and efforts to per-\nsonalize diabetes management are of\ncritical importance to minimize barriers\nto care, enhance participation, and max-\nimize response to treatment.\nEvidence about psychiatric disorders\nand symptoms in youth with type 2 dia-\nbetes is limited (256\u2013260), but given the\nsociocultural context for many youth and\nthe medical burden and obesity associ-\nated with type 2 diabetes, ongoing sur-\nveillance\nof\nmental\nhealth/behavioral\nhealth is indicated. Symptoms of depres-\nsion and disordered eating are common\nand associated with poorer glycemic con-\ntrol (39,257,261,262).\nMany of the medications prescribed\nfor diabetes and psychiatric disorders\nare associated with weight gain and can\nincrease concerns about eating, body\nshape, and weight (263,264).\nThe TODAY study documented high\nrates of maternal complications during\npregnancy and low rates of preconcep-\ntion counseling and contraception use\n(265).\nTRANSITION FROM PEDIATRIC TO\nADULT CARE\nRecommendations\n14.111 Pediatric diabetes care teams\nshould begin to prepare youth\nfor transition to adult health\ncare in early adolescence and,\nat the latest, at least 1 year\nbefore the transition. E\n14.112 Both pediatric and adult diabe-\ntes care professionals should\nprovide support and resources\nfor transitioning young adults. E\n14.113 Youth with type 2 diabetes\nshould be transferred to an\nadult-oriented diabetes spe-\ncialist when deemed appro-\npriate by the young adult and\nhealth care professional. E\nCare and close supervision of diabetes\nmanagement are increasingly shifted\nfrom parents and other adults to the\nyouth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes\nthroughout childhood and adolescence.\nThe shift from pediatric to adult health\ncare professionals, however, often oc-\ncurs abruptly as the older teen enters\nthe next developmental stage, referred\nto as emerging adulthood (266), which\nis a critical period for young people\nwho have diabetes. During this period\nof major life transitions, youth may be-\ngin to move out of their parents\u2019 homes\nand become increasingly responsible for\ntheir diabetes care. Their new responsi-\nbilities include self-management of their\ndiabetes, making medical appointments,\nand \ufb01nancing health care once they are\nno longer covered by their parents\u2019 health\ninsurance plans (ongoing coverage until\nage 26 years is currently available under\nprovisions of the U.S. Affordable Care\nAct). In addition to lapses in health care,\nthis is also a period associated with dete-\nrioration in glycemic stability; increased\noccurrence of acute complications; psy-\nchosocial, emotional, and behavioral chal-\nlenges; and the emergence of chronic\ncomplications (267\u2013272). The transition\nperiod from pediatric to adult care is\nprone to fragmentation in health care de-\nlivery, which may adversely impact health\ncare quality, cost, and outcomes (273).\nWorsening diabetes health outcomes\nduring the transition to adult care and\nearly adulthood have been documented\n(274,275).\nAlthough scienti\ufb01c evidence is limited,\nit is clear that comprehensive and coordi-\nnated planning that begins in early ado-\nlescence is necessary to facilitate a\nseamless transition from pediatric to\nadult health care (267,268,276,277). New\ntechnologies and other interventions are\nbeing tried to support the transition to\nadult care in young adulthood (278\u2013282).\nGiven the behavioral, psychosocial, and\ndevelopmental factors that relate to this\ntransition, diabetes care teams addressing\ntransition should include social workers,\npsychologists, and other behavioral health\nprofessionals, as available (51,283). A\ncomprehensive discussion regarding the\nchallenges faced during this period, in-\ncluding\nspeci\ufb01c\nrecommendations,\nis\nfound in the ADA position statement\n\u201cDiabetes Care for Emerging Adults: Rec-\nommendations for Transition From Pedi-\natric to Adult Diabetes Care Systems\u201d\n(268).\nThe Endocrine Society, in collabora-\ntion with the ADA and other organiza-\ntions, has developed transition tools for\nclinicians and youth and families (277).\nReferences\n1.

Not only is the prevalence of type 1 diabe-\ntes and type 2 diabetes increasing in individuals of reproductive age, but there is\nalso a dramatic increase in the reported rates of gestational diabetes mellitus\n(GDM). Diabetes confers signi\ufb01cantly greater maternal and fetal risk largely related\nto the degree of hyperglycemia but also related to chronic complications and co-\nmorbidities of diabetes. In general, speci\ufb01c risks of diabetes in pregnancy include\nspontaneous abortion, fetal anomalies, preeclampsia, fetal demise, macrosomia,\nneonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal respiratory distress syn-\ndrome, among others. In addition, diabetes in pregnancy may increase the risk of\nobesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in offspring later in life (1,2).\nPreconception Counseling\nRecommendations\n15.1\nStarting at puberty and continuing in all people with diabetes and re-\nproductive potential, preconception counseling should be incorporated\ninto routine diabetes care. A\n15.2\nFamily planning should be discussed, and effective contraception (with\nconsideration of long-acting, reversible contraception) should be pre-\nscribed and used until an individual\u2019s treatment plan and A1C are opti-\nmized for pregnancy. A\n15.3\nPreconception counseling should address the importance of achieving\nglucose levels as close to normal as is safely possible, ideally A1C\n<6.5% (48 mmol/mol), to reduce the risk of congenital anomalies, pre-\neclampsia, macrosomia, preterm birth, and other complications.

    "text": "All individuals with diabetes and repro-\nductive potential should be informed\nabout the importance of achieving and\nmaintaining as near euglycemia as safely\npossible prior to conception and through-\nout pregnancy. Observational studies show\nan increased risk of diabetic embryopathy,\nespecially anencephaly, microcephaly, con-\ngenital heart disease, renal anomalies,\nand caudal regression, directly propor-\ntional to elevations in A1C during the\n\ufb01rst 10 weeks of pregnancy (3). Although\nobservational studies are confounded by\nthe association between elevated peri-\nconceptional A1C and other engagement\nin self-care behaviors, the quantity and\nconsistency of data are convincing and\nsupport the recommendation to opti-\nmize glycemia prior to conception,\ngiven that organogenesis occurs pri-\nmarily at 5\u20138 weeks of gestation, with\nan A1C <6.5% (48 mmol/mol), which\nis associated with the lowest risk of\ncongenital\nanomalies,\npreeclampsia,\nand preterm birth (3\u20137). A systematic\nreview and meta-analysis of observa-\ntional studies of preconception care for\npregnant individuals with preexisting dia-\nbetes demonstrated lower A1C and re-\nduced risk of birth defects, preterm\ndelivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-ges-\ntational-age births, and neonatal inten-\nsive care unit admission (8).\nThere are opportunities to educate\nall adults and adolescents with diabetes\nand reproductive potential about the\nrisks of unplanned pregnancies and\nabout improved maternal and fetal out-\ncomes with pregnancy planning (8). Ef-\nfective preconception counseling could\navert substantial health and associated\ncost burdens in offspring (9). Family\nplanning should be discussed, including\nthe bene\ufb01ts of long-acting, reversible\ncontraception, and effective contracep-\ntion should be prescribed and used until\nthe individual is prepared and ready to\nbecome pregnant (10\u201314).\nTo minimize the occurrence of compli-\ncations, beginning at the onset of puberty\nor at diagnosis, all adults and adolescents\nwith diabetes of childbearing potential\nshould receive education about 1) the\nrisks of malformations associated with un-\nplanned pregnancies and even mild hy-\nperglycemia and 2) the use of effective\ncontraception at all times when prevent-\ning a pregnancy. Preconception counsel-\ning using developmentally appropriate\neducational tools enables adolescent girls\nto make well-informed decisions (8). Pre-\nconception counseling resources tailored\nfor adolescents are available at no cost\nthrough the American Diabetes Associa-\ntion (ADA) (15).\nPreconception Care\nRecommendations\n15.4 Individuals with preexisting\ndiabetes who are planning a\npregnancy should ideally begin\nreceiving care in preconception\nat a multidisciplinary clinic in-\ncluding an endocrinologist, ma-\nternal-fetal medicine specialist,\nregistered dietitian nutritionist,\nand diabetes care and education\nspecialist, when available. B\n15.5 In addition to focused attention\non achieving glycemic targets\nA, standard preconception care\nshould be augmented with ex-\ntra focus on nutrition, diabetes\neducation, and screening for\ndiabetes comorbidities and\ncomplications. B\n15.6 Individuals with preexisting type 1\nor type 2 diabetes who are\nplanning a pregnancy or who\nhave become pregnant should\nbe counseled on the risk of de-\nvelopment and/or progression\nof diabetic retinopathy. Dilated\neye examinations should occur\nideally before pregnancy or in\nthe \ufb01rst trimester, and then\npregnant individuals should be\nmonitored every trimester and\nfor 1 year postpartum as indi-\ncated by the degree of reti-\nnopathy and as recommended\nby the eye care health care\nprofessional. B\nThe importance of preconception care for\nall pregnant people is highlighted by\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gy-\nnecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion\n762, \u201cPrepregnancy Counseling\u201d (16). Pre-\nconception counseling for pregnant peo-\nple with preexisting type 1 or type 2\ndiabetes is highly effective in reducing the\nrisk of congenital malformations and de-\ncreasing the risk of preterm delivery and\nadmission to neonatal intensive care units.\nPreconception counseling likely also re-\nduces perinatal mortality and small-for-\ngestational-age birth weight (17). A key\npoint is the need to incorporate a ques-\ntion about plans for pregnancy into the\nroutine primary and gynecologic care of\npeople with diabetes. Preconception\ncare for people with diabetes should in-\nclude the standard screenings and care\nrecommended for any person planning\npregnancy (16). Prescription of prenatal\nvitamins with at least 400 mg of folic\nacid and 150 mg of potassium iodide\n(18) is recommended prior to concep-\ntion. Review and counseling on the use\nof nicotine products, alcohol, and recrea-\ntional drugs, including marijuana, is im-\nportant. Standard care includes screening\nfor sexually transmitted diseases and thy-\nroid disease, recommended vaccinations,\nroutine genetic screening, a careful re-\nview of all prescription and nonprescrip-\ntion medications and supplements used,\nand a review of travel history and plans\nwith special attention to areas known to\nhave Zika virus, as outlined by ACOG. See\nTable 15.1 for additional details on ele-\nments of preconception care (16,19).\nCounseling on the speci\ufb01c risks of\nobesity in pregnancy and lifestyle inter-\nventions to prevent and treat obesity, in-\ncluding referral to a registered dietitian\nnutritionist (RDN), is recommended.\nDiabetes-speci\ufb01c counseling should\ninclude an explanation of the risks to\nmother and fetus related to pregnancy\nand the ways to reduce risk, including\nglycemic goal setting, lifestyle and be-\nhavioral\nmanagement,\nand\nmedical\nnutrition therapy (17). The most impor-\ntant diabetes-speci\ufb01c component of\npreconception care is the attainment\nof glycemic goals prior to conception.\nIn addition, the presence of microvas-\ncular complications is associated with\nhigher risk of disease progression and\nadverse pregnancy outcomes (20). Dia-\nbetes-speci\ufb01c testing should include\nA1C, creatinine, and urinary albumin-\nto-creatinine ratio. Special attention\nshould be paid to the review of the\nmedication list for potentially harmful\ndrugs, i.e., ACE inhibitors (21,22), an-\ngiotensin receptor blockers (21), and\nstatins (22,23). A referral for a compre-\nhensive eye exam is recommended. Indi-\nviduals with preexisting diabetic retino-\npathy will need close monitoring during\npregnancy to assess for the progression\nof retinopathy and provide treatment if\nindicated (24).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\nS255\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "including nutrient-dense fruits,\nvegetables, legumes, whole\ngrains, and healthy fats with\nn-3 fatty acids that include\nnuts and seeds and \ufb01sh in the\neating pattern. E\nPregnancy in people with normal glu-\ncose metabolism is characterized by\nfasting levels of blood glucose that are\nlower than in the nonpregnant state\ndue to insulin-independent glucose up-\ntake by the fetus and placenta and by\nmild postprandial hyperglycemia and car-\nbohydrate intolerance as a result of dia-\nbetogenic placental hormones. In people\nwith preexisting diabetes, glycemic tar-\ngets are usually achieved through a com-\nbination of insulin administration and\nmedical nutrition therapy. Because glyce-\nmic targets in pregnancy are stricter than\nin nonpregnant individuals, it is impor-\ntant that pregnant people with diabetes\neat consistent amounts of carbohy-\ndrates to match with insulin dosage\nand to avoid hyperglycemia or hypo-\nglycemia. Referral to an RDN is impor-\ntant to establish a food plan and\ninsulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and de-\ntermine weight gain goals. The quality\nof the carbohydrates should be evaluated.\nA subgroup analysis of the Continuous\nGlucose Monitoring in Pregnant Women\nWith Type 1 Diabetes Trial (CONCEPTT)\nstudy demonstrated that the diets of indi-\nviduals planning pregnancy and currently\npregnant\nassessed\nduring\nthe\nrun-in\nphase prior to randomization were char-\nacterized by high-fat, low-\ufb01ber, and poor-\nquality carbohydrate intakes. Fruit and\nvegetable consumption was inadequate,\nwith one in four participants at risk for\nmicronutrient de\ufb01ciencies, highlighting\nthe importance of medical nutrition\ntherapy (25). An expert panel on nutri-\ntion in pregnancy recommends a balance\nof macronutrients. A diet that severely\nrestricts any macronutrient class should\nbe avoided, speci\ufb01cally the ketogenic diet\nthat lacks carbohydrates, the Paleo diet\nbecause of dairy restriction, and any\ndiet characterized by excess saturated\nfats. Nutrient-dense, whole foods are\nrecommended, including fruits, vegeta-\nbles, legumes, whole grains, and healthy\nfats with n-3 fatty acids that include nuts\nand seeds and \ufb01sh, which are less\nlikely to promote excessive weight gain.\nProcessed foods, fatty red meat, and\nsweetened foods and beverages should\nbe limited (26).\nInsulin Physiology\nGiven that early pregnancy is a time of\nenhanced insulin sensitivity and lower\nglucose levels, many people with type 1\ndiabetes will have lower insulin require-\nments and an increased risk for hypo-\nglycemia (27). Around 16 weeks, insulin\nresistance begins to increase, and total\ndaily insulin doses increase linearly \u00035%\nper week through week 36. This usually\nresults in a doubling of daily insulin dose\ncompared with the prepregnancy require-\nment. The insulin requirement levels off\ntoward the end of the third trimester\nwith placental aging. A rapid reduction in\ninsulin requirements can indicate the de-\nvelopment of placental insuf\ufb01ciency (28).\nIn people with normal pancreatic func-\ntion, insulin production is suf\ufb01cient to\nmeet the challenge of this physiological\ninsulin resistance and to maintain normal\nglucose levels. However, in people with\ndiabetes, hyperglycemia occurs if treat-\nment is not adjusted appropriately.\nGlucose Monitoring\nRe\ufb02ecting this physiology, fasting and\npostprandial blood glucose monitoring\nis recommended to achieve metabolic\ncontrol in pregnant people with diabe-\ntes. Preprandial testing is also recom-\nmended when using insulin pumps or\nbasal-bolus therapy so that premeal\nrapid-acting insulin dosage can be ad-\njusted. Postprandial monitoring is asso-\nciated with better glycemic outcomes\nand\na\nlower\nrisk\nof\npreeclampsia\n(29\u201331). There are no adequately pow-\nered randomized trials comparing differ-\nent\nfasting\nand\npostmeal\nglycemic\ntargets in diabetes in pregnancy.\nSimilar to the targets recommended\nby ACOG (upper limits are the same as\nfor GDM, described below) (32), the\nADA-recommended targets for pregnant\npeople with type 1 or type 2 diabetes\nare as follows:\n\u2022 Fasting glucose 70\u201395 mg/dL (3.9\u20135.3\nmmol/L) and either\n\u2022 One-hour postprandial glucose 110\u2013140\nmg/dL (6.1\u20137.8 mmol/L) or\n\u2022 Two-hour postprandial glucose 100\u2013120\nmg/dL (5.6\u20136.7 mmol/L)\nLower limits are based on the mean\nof normal blood glucose in pregnancy\n(33). Lower limits do not apply to individ-\nuals with type 2 diabetes treated with\nnutrition alone. Hypoglycemia in preg-\nnancy is as de\ufb01ned and treated in Rec-\nommendations\n6.10\u20136.15\n(Section\n6,\n\u201cGlycemic Targets\u201d). These values repre-\nsent optimal control if they can be\nachieved safely. In practice, it may be\nchallenging for a person with type 1 dia-\nbetes to achieve these targets without\nhypoglycemia, particularly those with a\nhistory of recurrent hypoglycemia or hy-\npoglycemia unawareness. If an individual\ncannot achieve these targets without sig-\nni\ufb01cant hypoglycemia, the ADA suggests\nless-stringent targets based on clinical\nexperience and individualization of care.\nA1C in Pregnancy\nIn studies of individuals without preexist-\ning diabetes, increasing A1C levels within\nthe normal range are associated with ad-\nverse outcomes (34). In the Hyperglyce-\nmia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome\n(HAPO) study, increasing levels of glyce-\nmia were also associated with worsening\noutcomes (35). Observational studies in\npreexisting diabetes and pregnancy show\nthe lowest rates of adverse fetal out-\ncomes in association with A1C <6\u20136.5%\n(42\u201348 mmol/mol) early in gestation\n(4\u20136,36). Clinical trials have not evalu-\nated the risks and bene\ufb01ts of achieving\nthese\ntargets,\nand\ntreatment\ngoals\nshould account for the risk of maternal\nhypoglycemia in setting an individualized\ntarget of <6% (42 mmol/mol) to <7%\n(53 mmol/mol). Due to physiological in-\ncreases in red blood cell turnover, A1C\nlevels\nfall\nduring\nnormal\npregnancy\n(37,38). Additionally, as A1C represents\nan integrated measure of glucose, it may\nnot fully capture postprandial hyperglyce-\nmia, which drives macrosomia. Thus, al-\nthough A1C may be useful, it should be\nused as a secondary measure of glycemic\noutcomes in pregnancy, after blood glu-\ncose monitoring.\nIn the second and third trimesters,\nA1C <6% (42 mmol/mol) has the lowest\nrisk of large-for-gestational-age infants\n(36,39,40), preterm delivery (41), and\npreeclampsia (1,42). Taking all of this into\naccount, a target of <6% (42 mmol/mol)\nis optimal during pregnancy if it can be\nachieved without signi\ufb01cant hypoglyce-\nmia.

Given the alter-\nation in red blood cell kinetics during\npregnancy and physiological changes in\nglycemic parameters, A1C levels may\nneed to be monitored more frequently\nthan usual (e.g., monthly).\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring in\nPregnancy\nCONCEPTT was a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT) of real-time continuous glu-\ncose monitoring (CGM) in addition to\nstandard care, including optimization of\npre- and postprandial glucose targets\nversus standard care for pregnant peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes. It demon-\nstrated the value of real-time CGM in\npregnancy complicated by type 1 dia-\nbetes by showing a mild improvement\nin A1C without an increase in hypogly-\ncemia and reductions in large-for-ges-\ntational-age births, length of stay, and\nneonatal hypoglycemia (44). An obser-\nvational cohort study that evaluated\nthe glycemic variables reported using\nCGM found that lower mean glucose,\nlower standard deviation, and a higher\npercentage of time in target range\nwere associated with lower risk of\nlarge-for-gestational-age births and other\nadverse neonatal outcomes (45). Use of\nthe CGM-reported mean glucose is supe-\nrior to the use of estimated A1C, glucose\nmanagement indicator, and other calcula-\ntions to estimate A1C, given the changes\nto A1C that occur in pregnancy (46).\nCGM time in range (TIR) can be used for\nassessment of glycemic outcomes in peo-\nple with type 1 diabetes, but it does not\nprovide actionable data to address fasting\nand postprandial hypoglycemia or hyper-\nglycemia. The cost of CGM in pregnancies\ncomplicated by type 1 diabetes is offset\nby improved maternal and neonatal out-\ncomes (47).\nThere are insuf\ufb01cient data to support\nthe use of CGM in people with type 2\ndiabetes or GDM (48,49).\nThe international consensus on TIR\n(50) endorses pregnancy target ranges\nand goals for TIR for people with type 1\ndiabetes using CGM as reported on the\nambulatory glucose pro\ufb01le; however, it\ndoes not specify the type or accuracy\nof the device or need for alarms and\nalerts. A prospective, observational study\nincluding 20 pregnant people with type 1\ndiabetes simultaneously monitored with\nintermittently scanning CGM (isCGM) and\nreal-time CGM (rtCGM) for 7 days in\nearly pregnancy demonstrated a higher\npercentage of time below range in the\nisCGM group. Asymptomatic hypoglyce-\nmia measured by isCGM should there-\nfore not necessarily lead to a reduction\nof insulin dose and/or increased carbo-\nhydrate intake at bedtime unless these\nepisodes are con\ufb01rmed by blood glucose\nmeter measurements (51). Selection of\nCGM device should be based on an indi-\nvidual\u2019s circumstances, preferences, and\nneeds.\n\u2022 Target range 63\u2013140 mg/dL (3.5\u20137.8\nmmol/L): TIR, goal >70%\n\u2022 Time below range (<63 mg/dL [3.5\nmmol/L]), goal <4%\n\u2022 Time below range (<54 mg/dL [3.0\nmmol/L]), goal <1%\n\u2022 Time above range (>140 mg/dL [7.8\nmmol/L]), goal <25%\nMANAGEMENT OF GESTATIONAL\nDIABETES MELLITUS\nRecommendations\n15.14 Lifestyle behavior change is\nan essential component of\nmanagement of gestational\ndiabetes mellitus and may\nsuf\ufb01ce as treatment for many\nindividuals. Insulin should be\nadded if needed to achieve\nglycemic targets. A\n15.15 Insulin is the preferred medica-\ntion for treating hyperglycemia\nin gestational diabetes melli-\ntus. Metformin and glyburide\nshould not be used as \ufb01rst-line\nagents, as both cross the pla-\ncenta to the fetus. A Other\noral and noninsulin injectable\nglucose-lowering medications\nlack long-term safety data.\n15.16 Metformin, when used to treat\npolycystic ovary syndrome and\ninduce ovulation, should be\ndiscontinued by the end of the\n\ufb01rst trimester. A\n15.17 Telehealth visits for pregnant\npeople with gestational diabe-\ntes mellitus improve outcomes\ncompared with standard in-\nperson care. A\nGDM is characterized by an increased risk\nof large-for-gestational-age birth weight\nand neonatal and pregnancy complica-\ntions and an increased risk of long-term\nmaternal type 2 diabetes and abnormal\nglucose metabolism of offspring in child-\nhood. These associations with maternal\noral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results\nare continuous with no clear in\ufb02ection\npoints (35,52). Offspring with exposure to\nuntreated GDM have reduced insulin sen-\nsitivity and b-cell compensation and are\nmore likely to have impaired glucose tol-\nerance in childhood (53). In other words,\nshort-term and long-term risks increase\nwith progressive maternal hyperglycemia.\nTherefore, all pregnant people should\nbe screened as outlined in Section 2,\n\u201cClassi\ufb01cation and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\nAlthough there is some heterogeneity,\nmany RCTs and a Cochrane review sug-\ngest that the risk of GDM may be re-\nduced by diet, exercise, and lifestyle\ncounseling, particularly when interven-\ntions are started during the \ufb01rst or early\nin the second trimester (54\u201356). There\nare no intervention trials in offspring of\nmothers with GDM. A meta-analysis of\n11 RCTs demonstrated that metformin\ntreatment in pregnancy does not reduce\nthe risk of GDM in high-risk individuals\nwith obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome,\nor preexisting insulin resistance (57). A\nmeta-analysis of 32 RCTs evaluating the\neffectiveness of telehealth visits for GDM\ndemonstrated reduction of incidences of\ncesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia,\npremature rupture of membranes, mac-\nrosomia, pregnancy-induced hypertension\nor preeclampsia, preterm birth, neonatal\nasphyxia, and polyhydramnios compared\nwith standard in-person care (58).\nLifestyle and Behavioral Management\nAfter diagnosis, treatment starts with\nmedical nutrition therapy, physical activity,\nand weight management, depending on\npregestational weight, as outlined in the\nsection below on preexisting type 2 diabe-\ntes, as well as glucose monitoring aiming\nfor the targets recommended by the\nFifth International Workshop-Conference\non Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (59):\n\u2022 Fasting glucose <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)\nand either\n\u2022 One-hour postprandial glucose <140\nmg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or\nS258\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Depending\non the population, studies suggest that\n70\u201385% of people diagnosed with GDM\nunder\nCarpenter-Coustan\ncriteria\ncan\nmanage GDM with lifestyle modi\ufb01cation\nalone; it is anticipated that this propor-\ntion will be even higher if the lower Inter-\nnational Association of the Diabetes and\nPregnancy Study Groups (60) diagnostic\nthresholds are used.\nMedical Nutrition Therapy\nMedical nutrition therapy for GDM is an\nindividualized nutrition plan developed\nbetween the pregnant person and an\nRDN familiar with the management of\nGDM (61,62). The food plan should pro-\nvide adequate calorie intake to promote\nfetal/neonatal and maternal health,\nachieve glycemic goals, and promote\nweight gain, according to the 2009 Insti-\ntute of Medicine recommendations (63).\nThere is no de\ufb01nitive research that iden-\nti\ufb01es a speci\ufb01c optimal calorie intake for\npeople with GDM or suggests that their\ncalorie needs are different from those of\npregnant individuals without GDM. The\nfood plan should be based on a nutri-\ntion assessment with dietary reference\nintake guidance from the National Insti-\ntute of Medicine. The recommended di-\netary reference intake for all pregnant\npeople is a minimum of 175 g of carbo-\nhydrate, a minimum of 71 g of protein,\nand 28 g of \ufb01ber (64). The nutrition plan\nshould emphasize monounsaturated and\npolyunsaturated fats while limiting satu-\nrated fats and avoiding trans fats. As is\ntrue for all nutrition therapy in people\nwith diabetes, the amount and type of\ncarbohydrate will impact glucose levels.\nThe current recommended amount of\ncarbohydrates is 175 g, or \u000335% of a\n2,000-calorie diet. Liberalizing higher\nquality, nutrient-dense carbohydrates re-\nsults in controlled fasting/postprandial\nglucose, lower free fatty acids, improved\ninsulin action, and vascular bene\ufb01ts and\nmay reduce excess infant adiposity. Indi-\nviduals who substitute fat for carbohy-\ndrates may unintentionally enhance\nlipolysis, promote elevated free fatty\nacids, and worsen maternal insulin re-\nsistance (65,66). Fasting urine ketone\ntesting may be useful to identify those\nwho are severely restricting carbohy-\ndrates to control blood glucose. Sim-\nple carbohydrates will result in higher\npostmeal excursions.\nPhysical Activity\nA systematic review demonstrated im-\nprovements in glucose control and reduc-\ntions in need to start insulin or insulin\ndose requirements with an exercise inter-\nvention. There was heterogeneity in the\ntypes of effective exercise (aerobic, resis-\ntance, or both) and duration of exercise\n(20\u201350 min/day, 2\u20137 days/week of mod-\nerate intensity) (67).\nPharmacologic Therapy\nTreatment of GDM with lifestyle and in-\nsulin has been demonstrated to improve\nperinatal outcomes in two large random-\nized studies, as summarized in a U.S. Pre-\nventive Services Task Force review (68).\nInsulin is the \ufb01rst-line agent recom-\nmended for the treatment of GDM in\nthe U.S. While individual RCTs support\nlimited ef\ufb01cacy of metformin (69,70) and\nglyburide (71) in reducing glucose levels\nfor the treatment of GDM, these agents\nare not recommended as the \ufb01rst-line\ntreatment for GDM because they are\nknown to cross the placenta and data on\nlong-term safety for offspring is of some\nconcern (32). Furthermore, in separate\nRCTs, glyburide and metformin failed to\nprovide adequate glycemic outcomes in\n23% and 25\u201328% of participants with\nGDM, respectively (72,73).\nSulfonylureas\nSulfonylureas are known to cross the\nplacenta and have been associated with\nincreased neonatal hypoglycemia. Con-\ncentrations of glyburide in umbilical\ncord plasma are approximately 50\u201370%\nof maternal levels (72,73). In meta-\nanalyses and systematic reviews, gly-\nburide was associated with a higher\nrate of neonatal hypoglycemia, macroso-\nmia, and increased neonatal abdominal\ncircumference than insulin or metformin\n(74,75).\nGlyburide failed to be found noninferior\nto insulin based on a composite outcome\nof neonatal hypoglycemia, macrosomia,\nand hyperbilirubinemia (76). Long-term\nsafety data for offspring exposed to gly-\nburide are not available (76).\nMetformin\nMetformin was associated with a lower\nrisk of neonatal hypoglycemia and less\nmaternal weight gain than insulin in sys-\ntematic reviews (74,77\u201379). However,\nmetformin readily crosses the placenta,\nresulting in umbilical cord blood levels\nof metformin as high or higher than si-\nmultaneous maternal levels (80,81). In\nthe Metformin in Gestational Diabetes:\nThe Offspring Follow-Up (MiG TOFU)\nstudy\u2019s analyses of 7- to 9-year-old off-\nspring, the 9-year-old offspring exposed\nto metformin for the treatment of GDM\nin the Auckland cohort were heavier\nand had a higher waist-to-height ratio\nand waist circumference than those ex-\nposed to insulin (82). This difference\nwas not found in the Adelaide cohort.\nIn two RCTs of metformin use in preg-\nnancy for polycystic ovary syndrome,\nfollow-up of 4-year-old offspring dem-\nonstrated higher BMI and increased\nobesity in the offspring exposed to met-\nformin (83,84). A follow-up study at\n5\u201310 years showed that the offspring\nhad higher BMI, weight-to-height ratios,\nwaist circumferences, and a borderline\nincrease in fat mass (84,85). A recent\nmeta-analysis concluded that metformin\nexposure resulted in smaller neonates\nwith an acceleration of postnatal growth,\nresulting in higher BMI in childhood\n(84).\nRandomized, double-blind, controlled\ntrials comparing metformin with other\ntherapies for ovulation induction in indi-\nviduals with polycystic ovary syndrome\nhave not demonstrated bene\ufb01t in pre-\nventing spontaneous abortion or GDM\n(86), and there is no evidence-based\nneed to continue metformin in these in-\ndividuals (87\u201389).\nThere are some people with GDM re-\nquiring medical therapy who may not be\nable to use insulin safely or effectively\nduring pregnancy due to cost, language\nbarriers, comprehension, or cultural in-\n\ufb02uences. Oral agents may be an alterna-\ntive for these individuals after discussing\nthe known risks and the need for more\nlong-term safety data in offspring. How-\never, due to the potential for growth re-\nstriction or acidosis in the setting of\nplacental insuf\ufb01ciency, metformin should\nnot be used in pregnant people with hy-\npertension or preeclampsia or those at\nrisk for intrauterine growth restriction\n(90,91).\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nManagement of Diabetes in Pregnancy\nS259\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

Both multiple daily insulin injec-\ntions and continuous subcutaneous insulin\ninfusion are reasonable delivery strategies,\nand neither has been shown to be supe-\nrior to the other during pregnancy (92).\nMANAGEMENT OF PREEXISTING\nTYPE 1 DIABETES AND TYPE 2\nDIABETES IN PREGNANCY\nInsulin Use\nRecommendations\n15.18 Insulin should be used to man-\nage type 1 diabetes in preg-\nnancy. A Insulin is the preferred\nagent for the management of\ntype 2 diabetes in pregnancy. B\n15.19 Either multiple daily injections\nor insulin pump technology\ncan be used in pregnancy com-\nplicated by type 1 diabetes. C\nThe physiology of pregnancy necessitates\nfrequent titration of insulin to match\nchanging requirements and underscores\nthe importance of daily and frequent\nblood glucose monitoring. Due to the\ncomplexity of insulin management in\npregnancy, referral to a specialized cen-\nter offering team-based care (with team\nmembers including a maternal-fetal med-\nicine specialist, endocrinologist or other\nhealth care professional experienced in\nmanaging pregnancy and preexisting dia-\nbetes, RDN, diabetes care and education\nspecialist, and social worker, as needed)\nis recommended if this resource is\navailable.\nNone of the currently available human\ninsulin preparations have been demon-\nstrated to cross the placenta (92\u201397). In-\nsulins studied in RCTs are preferred\n(98\u2013101) over those studied in cohort\nstudies (102), which are preferred over\nthose studied in case reports only.\nWhile many health care professionals\nprefer insulin pumps in pregnancy, it is\nnot clear that they are superior to multi-\nple daily injections (103,104). None of\nthe current hybrid closed-loop insulin pump\nsystems approved by the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (FDA) achieve preg-\nnancy targets. However, predictive low-\nglucose suspend (PLGS) technology has\nbeen shown in nonpregnant people to be\nbetter than sensor-augmented insulin pumps\n(SAP) for reducing low glucose values (105).\nIt may be suited for pregnancy because the\npredictive low-glucose threshold for sus-\npending insulin is in the range of premeal\nand overnight glucose value targets in\npregnancy and may allow for more\naggressive prandial dosing. See SENSOR-\nAUGMENTED PUMPS and AUTOMATED INSULIN DELIVERY\nSYSTEMS in Section 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology,\u201d\nfor more information on these systems.\nType 1 Diabetes\nPregnant individuals with type 1 diabe-\ntes have an increased risk of hypoglyce-\nmia in the \ufb01rst trimester and, like all\npregnant people, have altered counter-\nregulatory response in pregnancy that\nmay decrease hypoglycemia awareness.\nEducation for people with diabetes and\nfamily members about the prevention,\nrecognition, and treatment of hypogly-\ncemia is important before, during, and\nafter pregnancy to help prevent and\nmanage hypoglycemia\u2019s risks. Insulin re-\nsistance drops rapidly with the delivery\nof the placenta.\nPregnancy is a ketogenic state, and\npeople with type 1 diabetes, and to a\nlesser extent those with type 2 diabe-\ntes, are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis\n(DKA) at lower blood glucose levels\nthan in the nonpregnant state. Pregnant\npeople with type 1 diabetes should be\nprescribed ketone strips and receive ed-\nucation on DKA prevention and detec-\ntion. DKA carries a high risk of stillbirth.\nThose in DKA who are unable to eat of-\nten require 10% dextrose with an insu-\nlin drip to adequately meet the higher\ncarbohydrate demands of the placenta\nand fetus in the third trimester in order\nto resolve their ketosis.\nRetinopathy is a special concern in preg-\nnancy. The necessary rapid implementation\nof euglycemia in the setting of retinopa-\nthy is associated with worsening of reti-\nnopathy (106).\nType 2 Diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with\nobesity. Recommended weight gain dur-\ning pregnancy for people with overweight\nis 15\u201325 lb and for those with obesity is\n10\u201320 lb (63). There are no adequate\ndata on optimal weight gain versus\nweight maintenance in pregnant peo-\nple with BMI >35 kg/m2.\nOptimal glycemic targets are often eas-\nier to achieve during pregnancy with\ntype 2 diabetes than with type 1 diabetes\nbut can require much higher doses of in-\nsulin, sometimes necessitating concen-\ntrated insulin formulations. Insulin is the\npreferred treatment for type 2 diabetes\nin pregnancy. An RCT of metformin\nadded to insulin for the treatment of\ntype 2 diabetes found less maternal\nweight gain and fewer cesarean births.\nThere were fewer macrosomic neonates,\nbut there was a doubling of small-for-\ngestational-age neonates (107). As in\ntype 1 diabetes, insulin requirements\ndrop dramatically after delivery.\nThe risk for associated hypertension\nand other comorbidities may be as high\nor higher with type 2 diabetes as with\ntype 1 diabetes, even if diabetes is bet-\nter managed and of shorter apparent\nduration, with pregnancy loss appearing\nto be more prevalent in the third tri-\nmester in those with type 2 diabetes,\ncompared with the \ufb01rst trimester in\nthose with type 1 diabetes (108,109).\nPREECLAMPSIA AND ASPIRIN\nInsulin Use\nRecommendation\n15.20 Pregnant individuals with type 1\nor type 2 diabetes should be\nprescribed\nlow-dose\naspirin\n100\u2013150 mg/day starting at 12\nto 16 weeks of gestation to\nlower the risk of preeclampsia.\nE A dosage of 162 mg/day\nmay be acceptable E; currently,\nin the U.S., low-dose aspirin is\navailable in 81-mg tablets.\nDiabetes in pregnancy is associated with\nan increased risk of preeclampsia (110).\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\nrecommends\nusing\nlow-dose\naspirin\n(81 mg/day) as a preventive medication\nat 12 weeks of gestation in individuals at\nhigh risk for preeclampsia (111). How-\never, a meta-analysis and an additional\ntrial demonstrate that low-dose aspirin\n<100 mg is not effective in reducing\npreeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin >100\nmg is required (112\u2013114). A cost-bene\ufb01t\nanalysis has concluded that this ap-\nproach would reduce morbidity, save\nlives, and lower health care costs (115).\nHowever, there is insuf\ufb01cient data regard-\ning bene\ufb01ts of aspirin in pregnant people\nwith preexisting diabetes (116,117).

A There are\nlimited data on the optimal\nlower limit, but therapy should\nbe lessened for blood pressure\n<90/60 mmHg. E A blood pres-\nsure target of 110\u2013135/85 mmHg\nis suggested in the interest of\nreducing the risk for acceler-\nated maternal hypertension. A\n15.22 Potentially harmful medica-\ntions in pregnancy (i.e., ACE\ninhibitors, angiotensin receptor\nblockers,\nstatins)\nshould\nbe\nstopped prior to conception\nand avoided in sexually active\nindividuals of childbearing po-\ntential who are not using reli-\nable contraception. B\nIn normal pregnancy, blood pressure is\nlower than in the nonpregnant state.\nThe Chronic Hypertension and Preg-\nnancy (CHAP) Trial Consortium\u2019s RCT on\ntreatment for mild chronic hypertension\nduring pregnancy demonstrated that a\nblood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, as the\nthreshold for initiation or titration of\ntreatment, reduces the incidence of ad-\nverse pregnancy outcomes without com-\npromising fetal growth (118). The CHAP\nConsortium\u2019s study mitigates concerns\nabout small-for-gestational-age birth\nweight. Attained mean \u00b1 SD blood\npressure measurements in the treated\nversus untreated groups were systolic\n129.5 \u00b1 10.0 vs. 132.6 \u00b1 10.1 mmHg\n(between-group difference \u00043.11 [95%\nCI \u00043.95 to 2.28]) and diastolic 79.1 \u00b1\n7.4 vs. 81.5 \u00b1 8.0 mmHg (\u00042.33 [\u00042.97\nto 0.04]) (118). Individuals with diabetes\nhad an even better composite outcome\nscore than those without diabetes (118).\nAs a result of the CHAP study, ACOG\nissued a Practice Advisory recommend-\ning a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg\nas the threshold for initiation or titration\nof medical therapy for chronic hyperten-\nsion in pregnancy (119) rather than their\npreviously recommended threshold of\n160/110 mmHg (120).\nThe CHAP study provides additional\nguidance for the management of hyper-\ntension in pregnancy. Data from the\npreviously published Control of Hyperten-\nsion in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) supports\na target blood pressure goal of 110\u2013135/\n85 mmHg to reduce the risk of uncon-\ntrolled maternal hypertension and mini-\nmize impaired fetal growth (120\u2013122).\nThe 2015 study (121) excluded pregnan-\ncies complicated by preexisting diabetes,\nand only 6% of participants had GDM at\nenrollment. There was no difference in\npregnancy loss, neonatal care, or other\nneonatal outcomes between the groups\nwith tighter versus less tight control of\nhypertension (121).\nDuring pregnancy, treatment with ACE\ninhibitors and angiotensin receptor block-\ners is contraindicated because they may\ncause fetal renal dysplasia, oligohydram-\nnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and intra-\nuterine growth restriction (21).\nA large study found that after adjust-\ning for confounders, \ufb01rst trimester ACE\ninhibitor exposure does not appear to\nbe associated with congenital malforma-\ntions (123). However, ACE inhibitors and\nangiotensin receptor blockers should be\nstopped as soon as possible in the \ufb01rst\ntrimester to avoid second and third tri-\nmester fetopathy (123). Antihyperten-\nsive drugs known to be effective and\nsafe in pregnancy include methyldopa,\nnifedipine, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine,\nand prazosin. Atenolol is not recom-\nmended, but other b-blockers may be\nused, if necessary. Chronic diuretic use\nduring pregnancy is not recommended\nas it has been associated with restricted\nmaternal plasma volume, which may re-\nduce uteroplacental perfusion (124). On\nthe basis of available evidence, statins\nshould also be avoided in pregnancy\n(125).\nSee pregnancy and antihypertensive\nmedications in Section 10, \u201cCardiovascular\nDisease and Risk Management,\u201d for more\ninformation on managing blood pressure\nin pregnancy.\nPOSTPARTUM CARE\nRecommendations\n15.23 Insulin\nresistance\ndecreases\ndramatically immediately post-\npartum, and insulin require-\nments need to be evaluated\nand adjusted as they are often\nroughly half the prepregnancy\nrequirements\nfor\nthe\ninitial\nfew days postpartum. C\n15.24 A contraceptive plan should be\ndiscussed\nand\nimplemented\nwith all people with diabetes\nof reproductive potential. A\n15.25 Screen individuals with a re-\ncent history of gestational dia-\nbetes mellitus at 4\u201312 weeks\npostpartum,\nusing\nthe\n75-g\noral glucose tolerance test and\nclinically appropriate nonpreg-\nnancy diagnostic criteria. B\n15.26 Individuals\nwith\noverweight/\nobesity and a history of gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus found\nto have prediabetes should re-\nceive intensive lifestyle inter-\nventions and/or metformin to\nprevent diabetes. A\n15.27 Breastfeeding is recommended\nto reduce the risk of maternal\ntype 2 diabetes and should\nbe considered when choosing\nwhether to breastfeed or for-\nmula feed. B\n15.28 Individuals with a history of\ngestational diabetes mellitus\nshould have lifelong screen-\ning for the development of\ntype 2 diabetes or prediabe-\ntes every 1\u20133 years.

    "text": "tested for persistent diabetes or predia-\nbetes at 4\u201312 weeks postpartum with a\nfasting 75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy cri-\nteria as outlined in Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation\nand Diagnosis of Diabetes,\u201d speci\ufb01cally\nTable 2.2. In the absence of unequivocal\nhyperglycemia, a positive screen for dia-\nbetes requires two abnormal values. If\nboth the fasting plasma glucose ($126\nmg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glu-\ncose ($200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are ab-\nnormal in a single screening test, then\nthe diagnosis of diabetes is made. If only\none abnormal value in the OGTT meets\ndiabetes criteria, the test should be re-\npeated to con\ufb01rm that the abnormality\npersists. OGTT testing immediately post-\npartum,\nwhile still hospitalized, has\ndemonstrated improved engagement in\ntesting but also variably reduced sensi-\ntivity to the diagnosis of impaired fast-\ning glucose, impaired glucose tolerance,\nand type 2 diabetes (126,127).\nPostpartum Follow-up\nThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at\n4\u201312 weeks postpartum because A1C\nmay be persistently impacted (lowered)\nby the increased red blood cell turnover\nrelated to pregnancy, by blood loss at de-\nlivery, or by the preceding 3-month glu-\ncose pro\ufb01le. The OGTT is more sensitive\nat detecting glucose intolerance, including\nboth prediabetes and diabetes. Individu-\nals of childbearing potential with predia-\nbetes may develop type 2 diabetes by\nthe time of their next pregnancy and will\nneed preconception evaluation. Because\nGDM is associated with an increased life-\ntime maternal risk for diabetes estimated\nat 50\u201360% (128,129), individuals should\nalso be tested every 1\u20133 years thereafter\nif the 4\u201312 weeks postpartum 75-g OGTT\nis normal. Ongoing evaluation may be\nperformed with any recommended glyce-\nmic test (e.g., annual A1C, annual fasting\nplasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT us-\ning nonpregnant thresholds).\nGestational Diabetes Mellitus and Type 2\nDiabetes\nIndividuals with a history of GDM have a\ngreatly increased risk of conversion to\ntype 2 diabetes over time (129), and\nthose with GDM have a 10-fold increased\nrisk of developing type 2 diabetes com-\npared with those without GDM (128).\nAbsolute risk of developing type 2 diabe-\ntes after GDM increases linearly through\na person\u2019s lifetime, being approximately\n20% at 10 years, 30% at 20 years, 40%\nat 30 years, 50% at 40 years, and 60% at\n50 years (129). In the prospective Nurses\u2019\nHealth Study II (NHS II), subsequent dia-\nbetes risk after a history of GDM was sig-\nni\ufb01cantly lower in those who followed\nhealthy eating patterns (130). Adjusting\nfor BMI attenuated this association mod-\nerately, but not completely. Interpreg-\nnancy weight gain is associated with\nincreased risk of adverse pregnancy out-\ncomes (131) and higher risk of GDM,\nwhile in people with BMI >25 kg/m2,\nweight loss is associated with lower risk\nof developing GDM in the subsequent\npregnancy (132). Development of type 2\ndiabetes is 18% higher per unit of BMI\nincrease from prepregnancy BMI at\nfollow-up, highlighting the importance\nof effective weight management after\nGDM (133). In addition, postdelivery\nlifestyle interventions are effective in\nreducing risk of type 2 diabetes (134).\nBoth metformin and intensive lifestyle\nintervention prevent or delay progression\nto diabetes in individuals with prediabetes\nand a history of GDM. Only \ufb01ve to six indi-\nviduals with prediabetes and a history of\nGDM need to be treated with either inter-\nvention to prevent one case of diabetes\nover 3 years (135). In these individuals, life-\nstyle intervention and metformin reduced\nprogression to diabetes by 35% and 40%,\nrespectively, over 10 years compared with\nplacebo (136). If the pregnancy has moti-\nvated the adoption of healthy nutrition,\nbuilding on these gains to support weight\nloss is recommended in the postpartum\nperiod. (See Section 3, \u201cPrevention or\nDelay of Type 2 Diabetes and Associated\nComorbidities.\u201d)\nPreexisting Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes\nInsulin sensitivity increases dramatically\nwith the delivery of the placenta. In one\nstudy, insulin requirements in the immedi-\nate postpartum period are roughly 34%\nlower than prepregnancy insulin require-\nments (137). Insulin sensitivity then re-\nturns to prepregnancy levels over the\nfollowing 1\u20132 weeks. For individuals tak-\ning insulin, particular attention should be\ndirected to hypoglycemia prevention in\nthe setting of breastfeeding and erratic\nsleep and eating schedules (138).\nLactation\nConsidering the immediate nutritional\nand immunological bene\ufb01ts of breastfeed-\ning for the baby, all mothers, including\nthose with diabetes, should be supported\nin attempts to breastfeed. Breastfeeding\nmay also confer longer-term metabolic\nbene\ufb01ts to both mother (139) and off-\nspring (140). Breastfeeding reduces the\nrisk of developing type 2 diabetes in\nmothers with previous GDM. It may\nimprove the metabolic risk factors\nof offspring, but more studies are\nneeded (141). However, lactation can\nincrease the risk of overnight hypo-\nglycemia, and insulin dosing may need\nto be adjusted.\nContraception\nA major barrier to effective preconcep-\ntion care is the fact that the majority of\npregnancies are unplanned. Planning\npregnancy is critical in individuals with\npreexisting diabetes to achieve the opti-\nmal glycemic targets necessary to pre-\nvent congenital malformations and reduce\nthe risk of other complications. Therefore,\nall individuals with diabetes of child-\nbearing potential should have family\nplanning options reviewed at regular\nintervals to make sure that effective\ncontraception is implemented and main-\ntained. This applies to individuals in the\nimmediate postpartum period. Individu-\nals with diabetes have the same contra-\nception options and recommendations as\nthose without diabetes. Long-acting, re-\nversible contraception may be ideal for\nindividuals with diabetes and childbear-\ning potential. The risk of an unplanned\npregnancy outweighs the risk of any cur-\nrently available contraception option.\nReferences\n1.

Careful management of people with diabetes during hospitalization has direct\nand immediate bene\ufb01ts. Diabetes management in the inpatient setting is facilitated\nby preadmission treatment of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes, having elec-\ntive procedures, a dedicated inpatient diabetes service applying well-developed\nand validated standards of care, and careful transition to prearranged outpatient\nmanagement. These steps can shorten hospital stays, reduce the need for readmis-\nsion and emergency department visits, and improve outcomes. Some in-depth re-\nviews of in-hospital care and care transitions for adults with diabetes have been\npublished (2\u20134). For older hospitalized patients or for patients in long-term care fa-\ncilities, please see Section 13, \u201cOlder Adults.\u201d\nHOSPITAL CARE DELIVERY STANDARDS\nRecommendations\n16.1\nPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (blood\nglucose >140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if not per-\nformed in the prior 3 months.

B\nConsiderations on Admission\nHigh-quality hospital care for diabetes requires standards for care delivery, which are\nbest implemented using structured order sets and quality improvement strategies for\nprocess improvement. Unfortunately, \u201cbest practice\u201d protocols, reviews, and guide-\nlines (2,4) are inconsistently implemented within hospitals. To correct this, medical\ncenters striving for optimal inpatient diabetes treatment should establish protocols\nand structured order sets, which include computerized provider order entry (CPOE).\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G,\nAroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.\n16.

    "text": "Initial orders should state the type of\ndiabetes (i.e., type 1, type 2, gestational\ndiabetes mellitus, pancreatogenic diabetes)\nwhen it is known. Because inpatient treat-\nment and discharge planning are more ef-\nfective if based on preadmission glycemia,\nA1C should be measured for all people\nwith diabetes or hyperglycemia admit-\nted to the hospital if an A1C test has not\nbeen performed in the previous 3 months\n(5\u20138). In addition, diabetes self-manage-\nment knowledge and behaviors should\nbe assessed on admission, and diabetes\nself-management education provided, es-\npecially if a new treatment plan is being\nconsidered. Diabetes self-management\neducation should include appropriate skills\nneeded after discharge, such as medica-\ntion dosing and administration, glucose\nmonitoring, and recognition and treatment\nof hypoglycemia (9,10). Evidence supports\npreadmission treatment of hyperglycemia\nin people scheduled for elective sur-\ngery as an effective means of reducing\nadverse outcomes (11\u201314).\nThe National Academy of Medicine\nrecommends CPOE to prevent medication-\nrelated errors and increase medication\nadministration ef\ufb01ciency (15). Systematic\nreviews of randomized controlled trials\nusing computerized advice to improve\nglycemic outcomes in the hospital found\nsigni\ufb01cant improvement in the percent-\nage of time individuals spent in the target\nglucose range, lower mean blood glucose\nlevels, and no increase in hypoglycemia\n(16,17). Where feasible, there should be\nstructured order sets that provide comput-\nerized guidance for glycemic management.\nElectronic insulin order templates also im-\nprove mean glucose levels without increas-\ning hypoglycemia in people with type 2\ndiabetes, so structured insulin order sets\nincorporated into the CPOE can facilitate\nglycemic management (18,19). Insulin dos-\ning algorithms using machine learning\nand data in the electronic health record\n(EHR) currently in development show great\npromise to more accurately predict insulin\nrequirements during hospitalization com-\npared with existing clinical practices (20).\nDiabetes Care Specialists in the Hospital\nRecommendation\n16.3\nWhen caring for hospitalized\npeople with diabetes, consult\nwith a specialized diabetes or\nglucose management team\nwhen possible. C\nAppropriately trained specialists or spe-\ncialty teams may reduce the length of\nstay and improve glycemic and other clini-\ncal outcomes (21\u201323). In addition, the\nincreased risk of 30-day readmission fol-\nlowing hospitalization that has been at-\ntributed to diabetes can be reduced, and\ncosts saved when inpatient care is pro-\nvided by a specialized diabetes manage-\nment team (21,24,25). In a cross-sectional\nstudy comparing usual care to specialists\nreviewing diabetes cases and making\nrecommendations virtually through the\nEHR, rates of both hyperglycemia and\nhypoglycemia were reduced by 30\u201340%\n(26). Providing inpatient diabetes educa-\ntion and developing a diabetes discharge\nplan that includes continued access to dia-\nbetes medications and supplies and on-\ngoing education and support are key\nstrategies to improve outcomes (27\u201329).\nDetails of diabetes care team composi-\ntion are available in the Joint Commission\nstandards for programs and from the\nSociety of Hospital Medicine (30,31).\nEven the most ef\ufb01cacious orders may\nnot be carried out in a way that improves\nquality, nor are they automatically up-\ndated when new evidence arises. The\nJoint Commission accreditation program\nfor the hospital care of diabetes (31),\nthe Society of Hospital Medicine work-\nbook for program development (30), and\nthe Joint British Diabetes Societies (JBDS)\nfor Inpatient Care Group (32) are valu-\nable resources.\nGLYCEMIC TARGETS IN\nHOSPITALIZED ADULTS\nRecommendations\n16.4\nInsulin therapy should be initi-\nated for the treatment of per-\nsistent hyperglycemia starting\nat a threshold $180 mg/dL\n(10.0 mmol/L) (checked on two\noccasions). Once insulin ther-\napy is started, a target glu-\ncose range of 140\u2013180 mg/dL\n(7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L) is recom-\nmended for most critically ill\nand noncritically ill patients. A\n16.5\nMore stringent goals, such\nas 110\u2013140 mg/dL (6.1\u20137.8\nmmol/L) or 100\u2013180 mg/dL\n(5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L), may be\nappropriate for selected pa-\ntients and are acceptable if\nthey can be achieved without\nsigni\ufb01cant hypoglycemia. C\nStandard De\ufb01nitions of Glucose\nAbnormalities\nHyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is de-\n\ufb01ned as blood glucose levels >140 mg/dL\n(7.8 mmol/L) (33). Blood glucose levels\npersistently above this level warrant prompt\ninterventions, such as alterations in nu-\ntrition or changes to medications that\ncause hyperglycemia. An admission A1C\nvalue $6.5% (48 mmol/mol) suggests that\nthe onset of diabetes preceded hospitaliza-\ntion (see Section 2, \u201cClassi\ufb01cation and\nDiagnosis of Diabetes\u201d) (33,34). Hypoglyce-\nmia in hospitalized patients is categorized\nby blood glucose concentration and clinical\ncorrelates (Table 6.4) (35). Level 1 hypo-\nglycemia is de\ufb01ned as a glucose con-\ncentration of 54\u201370 mg/dL (3.0\u20133.9\nmmol/L). Level 2 hypoglycemia is de-\n\ufb01ned as a blood glucose concentration\n<54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), which is typi-\ncally the threshold for neuroglycopenic\nsymptoms. Level 3 hypoglycemia is de-\n\ufb01ned as a clinical event characterized by\naltered mental and/or physical functioning\nthat requires assistance from another per-\nson for recovery. Levels 2 and 3 require\nimmediate correction of low blood glu-\ncose. Prompt treatment of level 1 hypo-\nglycemia can prevent progression to more\nsigni\ufb01cant level 2 and level 3 hypoglycemia.\nGlycemic Targets\nIn a landmark clinical trial conducted in a\nsurgical intensive care unit, Van den Berghe\net al. (36) demonstrated that an intensive\nintravenous insulin protocol with a tar-\nget glycemic range of 80\u2013110 mg/dL\n(4.4\u20136.1 mmol/L) reduced mortality by\n40% compared with a standard approach\ntargeting blood glucose of 180\u2013215 mg/dL\n(10\u201312 mmol/L) in critically ill hospitalized\npatients with recent surgery. This study\nprovided robust evidence that active treat-\nment to lower blood glucose in hospital-\nized patients could have immediate\nbene\ufb01ts. However, a large, multicenter\nfollow-up study in critically ill hospital-\nized patients, the Normoglycemia in Inten-\nsive Care Evaluation and Survival Using\nGlucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR)\ntrial (37), led to a reconsideration of the\noptimal target range for glucose lower-\ning in critical illness. In this trial, criti-\ncally ill patients randomized to intensive\nglycemic management (80\u2013110 mg/dL)\nderived no signi\ufb01cant treatment advan-\ntage compared with a group with more\nmoderate glycemic targets (140\u2013180 mg/dL\n[7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L]) and had slightly but\nS268\nDiabetes Care in the Hospital\nDiabetes Care Volume 46, Supplement 1, January 2023\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

The \ufb01ndings\nfrom NICE-SUGAR are supported by sev-\neral meta-analyses and a randomized con-\ntrolled trial, some of which suggest that\ntight glycemic management increases\nmortality compared with more moder-\nate glycemic targets and generally causes\nhigher rates of hypoglycemia (38\u201340).\nBased on these results, insulin therapy\nshould be initiated for the treatment of\npersistent hyperglycemia $180 mg/dL\n(10.0 mmol/L) and targeted to a glucose\nrange of 140\u2013180 mg/dL (7.8\u201310.0 mmol/L)\nfor the majority of critically ill patients.\nAlthough not as well supported by data\nfrom randomized controlled trials, these\nrecommendations have been extended\nto hospitalized patients without critical\nillness. More stringent goals, such as\n110\u2013140 mg/dL (6.1\u20137.8 mmol/L), may be\nappropriate for selected patients (e.g., criti-\ncally ill postsurgical patients or patients\nwith cardiac surgery) as long as they can\nbe achieved without signi\ufb01cant hypogly-\ncemia (41\u201343). For inpatient management\nof hyperglycemia in noncritical care, the\nexpert consensus recommends a target\nrange of 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L)\nfor noncritically ill patients with \u201cnew\u201d\nhyperglycemia as well as people with\nknown diabetes prior to admission. It\nhas been found that fasting glucose levels\n<100 mg/dL are predictors of hypoglyce-\nmia within the next 24 h (44). Glycemic\nlevels >250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) may be\nacceptable in terminally ill patients with\nshort life expectancy. In these individuals,\nless aggressive insulin regimens to minimize\nglucosuria, dehydration, and electrolyte dis-\nturbances are often more appropriate.\nClinical judgment combined with ongoing\nassessment of clinical status, including\nchanges in the trajectory of glucose meas-\nures, illness severity, nutritional status, or\nconcomitant medications that might af-\nfect glucose levels (e.g., glucocorticoids),\nmay be incorporated into the day-to-day\ndecisions regarding insulin dosing (42).\nBLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING\nIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes\nwho are eating, point-of-care (POC) glu-\ncose monitoring should be performed be-\nfore meals; in those not eating, glucose\nmonitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h (33).\nMore frequent POC blood glucose moni-\ntoring ranging from every 30 min to every\n2 h is the required standard for safe use\nof intravenous insulin. Safety standards\nfor blood glucose monitoring that prohibit\nsharing lanceting devices, other testing\nmaterials, and needles are mandatory (45).\nThe vast majority of hospital glucose\nmonitoring is performed with FDA-approved\nprescription POC glucose monitoring sys-\ntems with and capillary blood taken from\n\ufb01nger sticks, similar to the process per-\nformed by outpatients for home blood\nglucose monitoring (46). POC blood glu-\ncose meters are not as accurate or as\nprecise as laboratory glucose analyzers,\nand capillary blood glucose readings are\nsubject to artifacts due to perfusion,\nedema, anemia/erythrocytosis, and sev-\neral medications commonly used in the\nhospital (47) (Table 7.1). The U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) has es-\ntablished standards for capillary (\ufb01nger-\nstick) blood glucose meters used in the\nambulatory setting, as well as standards\nto be applied for POC measures in the\nhospital (47). The balance between\nanalytic requirements (e.g., accuracy,\nprecision, interference) and clinical re-\nquirements (rapidity, simplicity, point of\ncare) has not been uniformly resolved\n(46,48), and most hospitals have arrived at\ntheir own policies to balance these param-\neters. It is critically important that devices\nselected for in-hospital use, and the\nwork\ufb02ow through which they are applied,\nhave careful analysis of performance and\nreliability and ongoing quality assessments.\nRecent studies indicate that POC measures\nprovide adequate information for usual\npractice, with only rare instances where\ncare has been compromised (49,50). Best\npractice dictates that any glucose result\nthat does not correlate with the pa-\ntient\u2019s clinical status should be con\ufb01rmed\nby measuring a serum sample in the clini-\ncal laboratory.\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring\nReal-time continuous glucose monitor-\ning (CGM) provides frequent measure-\nments of interstitial glucose levels and\nthe direction and magnitude of glucose\ntrends. Even though CGM has theoretical\nadvantages over POC glucose monitoring\nin detecting and reducing the incidence of\nhypoglycemia, it has not been approved\nby the FDA for inpatient use. Some hospi-\ntals with established glucose management\nteams allow the use of CGM in selected\npeople with diabetes on an individual ba-\nsis, mostly in noncritical care settings, pro-\nvided both the individual and the glucose\nmanagement team are well educated in\nthe use of this technology. CGM is not cur-\nrently approved for intensive care unit use\ndue to accuracy concerns such as hypovo-\nlemia, hypoperfusion, and use of therapies\nsuch as vasopressor agents.\nDuring the coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) pandemic, many institutions\nwere able to use CGM to minimize con-\ntact between health care professionals\nand people with diabetes, especially those\nin the intensive care unit under an FDA\npolicy of enforcement discretion during\nthe pandemic (51\u201359). This approach has\nbeen helpful in that regard, as well as in\nminimizing the use of personal protec-\ntive equipment. The availability of data\nabout the safe and effective use of CGM\nin the inpatient setting is evolving. Pre-\nliminary data suggest that CGM can sig-\nni\ufb01cantly improve glycemic management\nand other hospital outcomes (57,60\u201363).\nFor more information on CGM, see\nSection 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology.\u201d\nGLUCOSE-LOWERING TREATMENT\nIN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS\nRecommendations\n16.6\nBasal insulin or a basal plus\nbolus correction insulin regi-\nmen is the preferred treatment\nfor noncritically ill hospitalized\npatients with poor oral intake\nor those who are taking noth-\ning by mouth.

However, in certain\ncircumstances, it may be appropriate to\ncontinue home therapies, including oral\nglucose-lowering medications (64,65). If\noral medications are held in the hospital\nbut will be reinstated after discharge,\nthere should be a protocol for guiding\nresumption of home medications 1\u20132 days\nprior to discharge. For people taking insu-\nlin, several reports indicate that inpatient\nuse of insulin pens is safe and may be as-\nsociated with improved nurse satisfaction\ncompared with the use of insulin vials and\nsyringes with safety protocols in place\n(66\u201368). Insulin pens have been the sub-\nject of an FDA warning because of poten-\ntial blood-borne diseases if inadvertently\nshared with more than one person; the\nwarning \u201cFor single patient use only\u201d\nshould be rigorously followed using strict\nsafety measures such as barcoding to\nprevent errors (69,70).\nOutside of critical care units, scheduled\ninsulin orders are recommended to\nmanage hyperglycemia in people with di-\nabetes. Orders for insulin analogs or hu-\nman insulin result in similar glycemic\noutcomes in the hospital setting (71). The\nuse of subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting\ninsulin before meals, or every 4\u20136 h\nif no meals are given or if the individual\nis receiving continuous enteral/parenteral\nnutrition, is indicated to correct or prevent\nhyperglycemia. Basal insulin, or a basal\nplus bolus correction schedule, is the\npreferred treatment for noncritically\nill hospitalized patients with inadequate\noral intake or those restricted from oral\nintake. An insulin schedule with basal,\nprandial, and correction components is\nthe preferred treatment for most non-\ncritically ill hospitalized people with dia-\nbetes with adequate nutritional intake\n(72). In people with diabetes with blood\nglucose <240 mg/dL, consider alterna-\ntives to basal-bolus therapy as discussed\nbelow (72,73).\nFor individuals who are eating, insulin\ninjections should align with meals. In\nsuch instances, POC glucose monitoring\nshould be performed immediately before\nmeals. If oral intake is inadequate, a\nsafer procedure is administering pran-\ndial insulin immediately after eating,\nwith the dose adjusted to be appropriate\nfor the amount of carbohydrates ingested\n(71).\nA randomized controlled trial has shown\nthat basal-bolus treatment improved glyce-\nmic outcomes and reduced hospital com-\nplications compared with a correction or\nsupplemental insulin without basal insulin\n(formerly known as sliding scale) in general\nsurgery for people with type 2 diabetes\n(74). Prolonged use of correction or sup-\nplemental insulin without basal insulin\nas the sole treatment of hyperglycemia\nis strongly discouraged in the inpatient\nsetting, with the exception of people\nwith type 2 diabetes in noncritical care\nwith mild hyperglycemia (23,75,76).\nWhile there is evidence for using pre-\nmixed insulin formulations in the outpa-\ntient setting (77), an inpatient study of\n70/30 NPH/regular insulin versus basal-\nbolus therapy showed comparable gly-\ncemic outcomes but signi\ufb01cantly increased\nhypoglycemia in the group receiving insulin\nmixtures (78). Therefore, insulin mixtures\nsuch as 75/25 or 70/30 insulins are not\nroutinely recommended for in-hospital use.\nType 1 Diabetes\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, dosing\ninsulin based solely on premeal glucose\nlevels does not account for basal insulin\nrequirements or caloric intake, increasing\nthe risk of both hypoglycemia and hyper-\nglycemia. Typically, basal insulin dosing\nis based on body weight, with some evi-\ndence that people with renal insuf\ufb01ciency\nshould be treated with lower doses\n(79,80). An insulin schedule with basal\nand correction components is necessary\nfor all hospitalized individuals with type 1\ndiabetes, even when taking nothing by\nmouth, with the addition of prandial insu-\nlin when eating.\nTransitioning From Intravenous to\nSubcutaneous Insulin\nWhen discontinuing intravenous insulin,\na transition protocol is associated with\nless morbidity and lower costs of care\n(81,82) and is therefore recommended.\nA person with type 1 or type 2 diabetes\nbeing transitioned to a subcutaneous\nregimen should receive a dose of subcu-\ntaneous basal insulin 2 h before the in-\ntravenous infusion is discontinued. Prior\nto discontinuing an insulin infusion, initi-\nation of subcutaneous basal insulin may\nhelp minimize hyperglycemia and avoid\nrebound hypoglycemia (83,84). The dose\nof basal insulin is best calculated on the\nbasis of the insulin infusion rate during\nthe last 6 h when stable glycemic goals\nwere achieved (85). For people being transi-\ntioned to concentrated insulin (U-200,\nU-300, or U-500) in the inpatient setting,\nit is important to ensure correct dosing\nby utilizing an individual pen or cartridge\nfor each person and by meticulous phar-\nmacy and nursing supervision of the dose\nadministered (85,86).\nNoninsulin Therapies\nThe safety and ef\ufb01cacy of noninsulin\nglucose-lowering therapies in the hospi-\ntal setting is an area of active research\n(73,87\u201389). Several recent randomized\ntrials have demonstrated the potential\neffectiveness of glucagon-like peptide 1\nreceptor agonists and dipeptidyl pepti-\ndase 4 inhibitors in speci\ufb01c groups of\nhospitalized people with diabetes (90\u201393).\nHowever, an FDA bulletin states that\nhealth care professionals should consider\ndiscontinuing saxagliptin and alogliptin in\npeople who develop heart failure (94).\nSodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)\ninhibitors should be avoided in cases of\nsevere illness, in people with ketonemia\nor ketonuria, and during prolonged fasting\nand surgical procedures (4). Until safety\nand ef\ufb01cacy are established, SGLT2 inhibi-\ntors are not recommended for routine in-\nhospital use for diabetes management, al-\nthough they may be considered for the\ntreatment of people with type 2 diabetes\nwho have or are at risk for heart failure\n(95). Furthermore, the FDA has warned\nthat SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped\n3 days before scheduled surgeries (4 days\nin the case of ertugli\ufb02ozin) (96).\nHYPOGLYCEMIA\nRecommendations\n16.9\nA hypoglycemia management\nprotocol should be adopted\nand implemented by each hos-\npital or hospital system. A plan\nfor preventing and treating\nhypoglycemia should be estab-\nlished for each individual. Epi-\nsodes of hypoglycemia in the\nhospital should be documented\nin the medical record and\ntracked for quality improve-\nment/quality assessment.

    "text": "16.10 Treatment regimens should\nbe reviewed and changed as\nnecessary to prevent further\nhypoglycemia when a blood\nglucose value of <70 mg/dL\n(3.9 mmol/L) is documented. C\nPeople with or without diabetes may\nexperience hypoglycemia in the hospital\nsetting. While hypoglycemia is associated\nwith increased mortality (97), in many\ncases, it is a marker of an underlying\ndisease rather than the cause of fatality.\nHowever, hypoglycemia is a severe con-\nsequence of dysregulated metabolism\nand/or diabetes treatment, and it is im-\nperative that it be minimized during hos-\npitalization. Many episodes of inpatient\nhypoglycemia are preventable. Therefore,\na hypoglycemia prevention and manage-\nment protocol should be adopted and\nimplemented by each hospital or hospi-\ntal system. A standardized hospital-wide,\nnurse-initiated hypoglycemia treatment\nprotocol should be in place to immedi-\nately address blood glucose levels of\n<70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (98,99). In addi-\ntion, individualized plans for preventing\nand treating hypoglycemia for each in-\ndividual should also be developed. An\nAmerican Diabetes Association consensus\nstatement recommends that an individ-\nual\u2019s treatment plan be reviewed any time\na blood glucose value of <70 mg/dL\n(3.9 mmol/L) occurs, as such readings\noften predict subsequent level 3 hypo-\nglycemia. Episodes of hypoglycemia in\nthe hospital should be documented in\nthe medical record and tracked (1,2).\nTriggering Events and Prevention of\nHypoglycemia\nInsulin is one of the most common drugs\ncausing adverse events in hospitalized\npatients, and errors in insulin dosing\nand/or administration occur relatively\nfrequently (97,100,101). Beyond insu-\nlin dosing errors, common preventable\nsources of iatrogenic hypoglycemia are\nimproper prescribing of other glucose-\nlowering medications, inappropriate\nmanagement of the \ufb01rst episode of hypo-\nglycemia, and nutrition\u2013insulin mismatch,\noften related to an unexpected interrup-\ntion of nutrition (102). A recent study\ndescribes acute kidney injury as an im-\nportant risk factor for hypoglycemia in\nthe hospital (103), possibly as a result\nof decreased insulin clearance. Studies\nof \u201cbundled\u201d preventive therapies, includ-\ning proactive surveillance of glycemic\noutliers and an interdisciplinary data-\ndriven approach to glycemic management,\nshowed that hypoglycemic episodes in\nthe hospital could be prevented. Com-\npared with baseline, two such studies\nfound that hypoglycemic events fell by\n56\u201380% (99,104,105). The Joint Commis-\nsion recommends that all hypoglycemic\nepisodes be evaluated for a root cause\nand the episodes be aggregated and re-\nviewed to address systemic issues (31).\nIn addition to errors with insulin treat-\nment, iatrogenic hypoglycemia may be\ninduced by a sudden reduction of cor-\nticosteroid dose, reduced oral intake,\nemesis, inappropriate timing of short-\nor rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals,\nreduced infusion rate of intravenous dex-\ntrose, unexpected interruption of enteral\nor parenteral feedings, delayed or missed\nblood glucose checks, and altered ability\nof the individual to report symptoms (106).\nRecent inpatient CGM studies show\npromise for CGM as an early warning\nsystem to alert of impending hypoglyce-\nmia, offering an opportunity to mitigate\nit before it happens (60\u201363). The use of\npersonal CGM and automated insulin de-\nlivery devices, such as insulin pumps\nthat can automatically deliver correction\ndoses and change basal delivery rates in\nreal time, should be supported for ongo-\ning use during hospitalization for individ-\nuals who are capable of using devices\nsafely and independently when proper\nsupervision is available. Hospitals should\nbe encouraged to develop policies and\nprotocols to support inpatient use of\nindividual- and hospital-owned diabe-\ntes technology and have expert staff\navailable for safe implementation. Hos-\npital information technology teams are\nbeginning to integrate CGM data into\nthe electronic health record. The ability\nto download and interpret diabetes de-\nvice data during hospitalization can in-\nform insulin dosing during hospitalization\nand care transitions (107).\nFor more information on CGM, see\nSection 7, \u201cDiabetes Technology.\u201d\nPredictors of Hypoglycemia\nIn people with diabetes in the ambulatory\nsetting, it is well established that an epi-\nsode of severe hypoglycemia increases\nthe risk for a subsequent event, partly\nbecause of impaired counterregulation\n(108,109). This relationship also holds\ntrue for people with diabetes in the in-\npatient setting. For example, in a study of\nhospitalized individuals treated for hyper-\nglycemia, 84% who had an episode of\n\u201csevere hypoglycemia\u201d (de\ufb01ned in the\nstudy as <40 mg/dL [2.2 mmol/L]) had\na preceding episode of hypoglycemia\n(<70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) during the\nsame admission (110). In another study\nof hypoglycemic episodes (de\ufb01ned in the\nstudy as <50 mg/dL [2.8 mmol/L]), 78%\nof patients were using basal insulin, with\nthe incidence of hypoglycemia peaking\nbetween midnight and 6:00 A.M. Despite\nrecognition of hypoglycemia, 75% of indi-\nviduals did not have their dose of basal\ninsulin changed before the next insulin\nadministration (111).\nRecently, several groups have devel-\noped algorithms to predict episodes of\nhypoglycemia in the inpatient setting\n(112,113). Models such as these are po-\ntentially important and, once validated\nfor general use, could provide a valuable\ntool to reduce rates of hypoglycemia in\nthe hospital. In one retrospective cohort\nstudy data, a fasting blood glucose of\n<100 mg/dL was shown to be a predic-\ntor of next-day hypoglycemia (44).\nMEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY IN\nTHE HOSPITAL\nThe goals of medical nutrition therapy\nin the hospital are to provide adequate\ncalories to meet metabolic demands,\noptimize glycemic outcomes, address per-\nsonal food preferences, and facilitate the\ncreation of a discharge plan. The American\nDiabetes Association does not endorse\nany single meal plan or speci\ufb01ed percen-\ntages of macronutrients. Current nutrition\nrecommendations advise individualization\nbased on treatment goals, physiological\nparameters, and medication use. Consis-\ntent carbohydrate meal plans are pre-\nferred by many hospitals as they facilitate\nmatching the prandial insulin dose to the\namount of carbohydrate given (114). Or-\nders should also indicate that the meal\ndelivery and nutritional insulin coverage\nshould be coordinated, as their variabil-\nity often creates the possibility of hyper-\nglycemic and hypoglycemic events (28).\nMany hospitals offer \u201cmeals on demand,\u201d\nwhere individuals may order meals from\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nDiabetes Care in the Hospital\nS271\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

This\noption improves patient satisfaction but\ncomplicates meal-insulin coordination.\nFinally, if the hospital food service sup-\nports carbohydrate counting, this option\nshould be made available to people\nwith diabetes counting carbohydrates\nat home (115,116).\nSELF-MANAGEMENT IN THE\nHOSPITAL\nDiabetes self-management in the hospi-\ntal may be appropriate for speci\ufb01c indi-\nviduals who wish to continue to perform\nself-care while acutely ill (117,118). Can-\ndidates include children with parental\nsupervision, adolescents, and adults\nwho successfully perform diabetes self-\nmanagement at home and whose cogni-\ntive and physical skills needed to suc-\ncessfully self-administer insulin and\nperform glucose monitoring are not com-\npromised (9,119). In addition, they should\nhave adequate oral intake, be pro\ufb01cient\nin carbohydrate estimation, take multiple\ndaily insulin injections or use insulin\npumps, have stable insulin requirements,\nand understand sick-day management. If\nself-management is supported, a policy\nshould include a requirement that peo-\nple with diabetes and the care team\nagree that self-management is appro-\npriate on a daily basis during hospitaliza-\ntion. Hospital personal medication policies\nmay include guidance for people with\ndiabetes who wish to take their own or\nhospital-dispensed diabetes medications\nduring their hospital stay. A hospital pol-\nicy for personal medication may con-\nsider a pharmacy exception on a case-\nby-case basis along with the care team.\nPharmacy must verify any home medi-\ncation and require a prescriber order for\nthe individual to self-administer home or\nhospital-dispensed medication under the\nsupervision of the registered nurse. If an\ninsulin pump or CGM is worn, hospital pol-\nicy and procedures delineating guidelines\nfor wearing an insulin pump and/or CGM\ndevice should be developed according to\nconsensus guidelines, including the chang-\ning of infusion sites and glucose sensors\n(107,120,121). As outlined in Recommen-\ndation 7.30, people with diabetes wearing\ndiabetes devices should be supported\nto continue them in an inpatient setting\nwhen they are competent to perform self-\ncare and proper supervision is available.\nSTANDARDS FOR SPECIAL\nSITUATIONS\nEnteral/Parenteral Feedings\nFor individuals receiving enteral or par-\nenteral feedings who require insulin,\nthe insulin orders should include cover-\nage of basal, prandial, and correctional\nneeds (115,122,123). It is essential that\npeople with type 1 diabetes continue to\nreceive basal insulin even if feedings are\ndiscontinued.\nMost adults receiving basal insulin\nshould continue with their basal dose,\nwhile the insulin dose for the total daily\nnutritional component may be calculated\nas 1 unit of insulin for every 10\u201315 g car-\nbohydrate in the enteral and parenteral\nformulas. Commercially available cans of\nenteral nutrition contain variable amounts\nof carbohydrates and may be infused at\ndifferent rates. All of this must be consid-\nered while calculating insulin doses to\ncover the nutritional component of en-\nteral nutrition (116). Giving NPH insulin\ntwo or three times daily (every 8 or 12 h)\nto cover individual requirements is a\nreasonable option. Adjustments in in-\nsulin doses should be made frequently.\nCorrectional insulin should also be ad-\nministered subcutaneously every 6 h\nwith human regular insulin or every\n4 h with a rapid-acting insulin analog.\nIf enteral nutrition is interrupted, a 10%\ndextrose infusion should be started im-\nmediately to prevent hypoglycemia and\nto allow time to select more appropriate\ninsulin doses.\nFor adults receiving enteral bolus\nfeedings, approximately 1 unit of regular\nhuman insulin or rapid-acting insulin per\n10\u201315 g carbohydrate should be given\nsubcutaneously before each feeding. Cor-\nrectional insulin coverage should be\nadded as needed before each feeding.\nIn individuals receiving nocturnal tube\nfeeding, NPH insulin administered with\nthe initiation of the feeding represents\na reasonable approach to cover this\nnutritional load.\nFor individuals receiving continuous\nperipheral or central parenteral nutrition,\nhuman regular insulin may be added to\nthe solution, particularly if >20 units of\ncorrectional insulin have been required\nin the past 24 h. A starting dose of\n1 unit of human regular insulin for every\n10 g dextrose has been recommended\n(115) and should be adjusted daily in the\nsolution. Adding insulin to the parenteral\nnutrition bag is the safest way to prevent\nhypoglycemia if the parenteral nutrition\nis stopped or interrupted. Correctional\ninsulin should be administered subcu-\ntaneously to address any hyperglyce-\nmia. For full enteral/parenteral feeding\nguidance, please refer to review articles\ndetailing this topic (122,124,125).\nBecause continuous enteral or paren-\nteral nutrition results in a continuous\npostprandial state, efforts to bring blood\nglucose levels to below 140 mg/dL\n(7.8 mmol/L) substantially increase the\nrisk of hypoglycemia in these patients.\nGlucocorticoid Therapy\nThe prevalence of consistent use of glu-\ncocorticoid therapy in hospitalized pa-\ntients can approach 10%, and these\nmedications can induce hyperglycemia\nin 56\u201386% of these individuals with and\nwithout preexisting diabetes (126,127).\nIf left untreated, this hyperglycemia in-\ncreases mortality and morbidity risk, e.g.,\ninfections and cardiovascular events. Glu-\ncocorticoid type and duration of action\nmust be considered in determining appro-\npriate insulin treatments. Daily-ingested\nintermediate-acting glucocorticoids such\nas prednisone reach peak plasma levels\nin 4\u20136 h (128) but have pharmacologic\nactions that can last through the day.\nIndividuals placed on morning steroid\ntherapy have disproportionate hypergly-\ncemia during the day but frequently\nreach target blood glucose levels over-\nnight regardless of treatment (126). In\nsubjects on once- or twice-daily steroids,\nadministering intermediate-acting (NPH)\ninsulin is a standard approach. NPH is\nusually administered in addition to daily\nbasal-bolus insulin or in addition to oral\nglucose-lowering medications. Because NPH\naction peaks at 4\u20136 h after administration,\nit is recommended to administer it con-\ncomitantly with intermediate-acting ste-\nroids (129). For long-acting glucocorticoids\nsuch as dexamethasone and multidose or\ncontinuous glucocorticoid use, long-acting\nbasal insulin may be required to manage\nfasting blood glucose levels (65,130). For\nhigher doses of glucocorticoids, increasing\ndoses of prandial (if eating) and correc-\ntional insulin, sometimes as much as\n40\u201360% or more, are often needed in\naddition to basal insulin (72,131,132).

Whatever insulin orders\nare initiated, daily adjustments based on\nlevels of glycemia and anticipated changes\nin type, doses, and duration of glucocorti-\ncoids, along with POC blood glucose moni-\ntoring, are critical to reducing rates of\nhypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.\nPerioperative Care\nIt is estimated that up to 20% of general\nsurgery patients have diabetes, and 23\u2013\n60% have prediabetes or undiagnosed\ndiabetes. Surgical stress and counterre-\ngulatory hormone release increase the\nrisk of hyperglycemia as well as mortal-\nity, infection, and length of stay (134).\nThere is little data available to guide\ncare of people with diabetes through\nthe perioperative period.

Hold any other oral glucose-lowering\nagents the morning of surgery or\nprocedure and give half of NPH\ndose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog or insulin pump basal insulin\nbased on the type of diabetes and\nclinical judgment.\n7. Monitor blood glucose at least every\n2\u20134 h while the individual takes noth-\ning by mouth and dose with short-\nor rapid-acting insulin as needed.\n8. There are no data on the use and/or\nin\ufb02uence of glucagon-like peptide 1\nreceptor agonists or ultra-long-acting\ninsulin analogs on glycemia in periop-\nerative care.\nA recent review concluded that peri-\noperative glycemic targets tighter than\n80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) did\nnot improve outcomes and was asso-\nciated with more hypoglycemia (137);\ntherefore, in general, stricter glycemic\ntargets are not advised. Evidence from\na recent study indicates that compared\nwith usual dosing, a reduction of insulin\ngiven the evening before surgery by\n\u000125% was more likely to achieve peri-\noperative blood glucose levels in the\ntarget range with a lower risk for hy-\npoglycemia (141).\nIn noncardiac general surgery patients,\nbasal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-\nacting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has\nbeen associated with improved glycemic\noutcomes and lower rates of periopera-\ntive complications compared with the\nreactive, correction-only short- or rapid-\nacting insulin coverage alone with no\nbasal insulin dosing (74,134,142).\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis and\nHyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State\nThere is considerable variability in the\npresentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)\nand hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states,\nranging from euglycemia or mild hyper-\nglycemia and acidosis to severe hypergly-\ncemia, dehydration, and coma; therefore,\nindividualization of treatment based on a\ncareful clinical and laboratory assess-\nment is needed (83,143\u2013145).\nManagement goals include restora-\ntion of circulatory volume and tissue\nperfusion, resolution of hyperglycemia,\nand correction of electrolyte imbalance\nand acidosis. It is also essential to treat\nany correctable underlying cause of DKA,\nsuch as sepsis, myocardial infarction, or\nstroke. In critically ill and mentally obtunded\nindividuals with DKA or hyperosmolar hy-\nperglycemia, continuous intravenous in-\nsulin is the standard of care. Successful\ntransition from intravenous to subcuta-\nneous insulin requires administration\nof basal insulin 2\u20134 h before the intra-\nvenous insulin is stopped to prevent\nrecurrence of ketoacidosis and rebound\nhyperglycemia (143). There is no signi\ufb01-\ncant difference in outcomes for intra-\nvenous human regular insulin versus\nsubcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when\ncombined with aggressive \ufb02uid manage-\nment for treating mild or moderate DKA\n(146). Individuals with uncomplicated\nDKA may sometimes be treated with\nsubcutaneous insulin in the emergency\ndepartment or step-down units (147).\nThis approach may be safer and more\ncost-effective than treatment with intra-\nvenous insulin. If subcutaneous insulin\nadministration is used, it is important to\nprovide an adequate \ufb02uid replacement,\nfrequent POC blood glucose monitoring,\ntreatment of any concurrent infections,\nand appropriate follow-up to avoid re-\ncurrent DKA. Several studies have shown\nthat the use of bicarbonate in patients\nwith DKA made no difference in the\nresolution of acidosis or time to dis-\ncharge, and its use is generally not rec-\nommended (148). For further treatment\ninformation, refer to recent in-depth re-\nviews (4,106,149).\nTRANSITION FROM THE HOSPITAL\nTO THE AMBULATORY SETTING\nRecommendation\n16.11 A structured discharge plan\nshould be tailored to the in-\ndividual with diabetes. B\nA structured discharge plan tailored to\nthe individual may reduce the length of\nhospital stay and readmission rates and\nincrease satisfaction with the hospital\nexperience (150). Multiple strategies are\nkey, including diabetes education prior\nto discharge, diabetes medication rec-\nonciliation with attention to access, and\nscheduled virtual and/or face-to-face\nfollow-up visits after discharge. Discharge\nplanning should begin at admission and\nbe updated as individual needs change\n(3,151).\nThe transition from the acute care\nsetting presents risks for all people with\ndiabetes. Individuals may be discharged\nto varied settings, including home (with\nor without visiting nurse services), assisted\nliving, rehabilitation, or skilled nursing\nfacilities. For individuals discharged to\nhome or assisted living, the optimal dis-\ncharge plan will need to consider diabe-\ntes type and severity, effects of the\nillness on blood glucose levels, and the\nindividual\u2019s capabilities and preferences\n(29,152,153). See Section 13, \u201cOlder\nAdults,\u201d for more information.\nAn outpatient follow-up visit with the\nprimary care clinician, endocrinologist,\nor diabetes care and education specialist\ndiabetesjournals.org/care\nDiabetes Care in the Hospital\nS273\n\u00a9AmericanDiabetesAssociation",

    "text": "within 1 month of discharge is advised\nfor all individuals experiencing hyper-\nglycemia in the hospital. If glycemic\nmedications are changed or glucose\nmanagement is not optimal at discharge,\nan earlier appointment (in 1\u20132 weeks) is\npreferred, and frequent contact may be\nneeded to avoid hyperglycemia and\nhypoglycemia. A discharge algorithm\nfor glycemic medication adjustment based\non admission A1C, diabetes medications\nbefore admission, and insulin usage\nduring hospitalization was found use-\nful to guide treatment decisions and\nsigni\ufb01cantly improved A1C after dis-\ncharge (6). If an A1C from the prior 3\nmonths is unavailable, measuring the\nA1C in all people with diabetes or hy-\nperglycemia admitted to the hospital is\nrecommended upon admission.\nClear communication with outpatient\nhealth care professionals directly or via\nhospital discharge summaries facilitates\nsafe transitions to outpatient care. Pro-\nviding information regarding the root\ncause of hyperglycemia (or the plan for\ndetermining the cause), related compli-\ncations and comorbidities, and recom-\nmended treatments can assist outpatient\nhealth care professionals as they assume\nongoing care.\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research\nand Quality recommends that, at a min-\nimum, discharge plans include the fol-\nlowing (154):\nMedication Reconciliation\n\u2022 Home and hospital medications must\nbe cross-checked to ensure that no\nchronic medications are stopped and\nto ensure the safety of new and old\nprescriptions.\n\u2022 Prescriptions for new or changed\nmedication should be \ufb01lled and re-\nviewed with the individual and care\npartners at or before discharge.\nStructured Discharge Communication\n\u2022 Information on medication changes,\npending tests and studies, and follow-\nup needs must be accurately and\npromptly communicated to outpatient\nhealth care professionals.\n\u2022 Discharge summaries should be trans-\nmitted to the primary care clinician as\nsoon as possible after discharge.\n\u2022 Scheduling follow-up appointments\nprior to discharge with people with\ndiabetes agreeing to the time and\nplace increases the likelihood that\nthey will attend.\nIt is recommended that the following\nareas of knowledge be reviewed and ad-\ndressed before hospital discharge:\n\u2022 Identi\ufb01cation of the health care pro-\nfessionals who will provide diabetes\ncare after discharge.\n\u2022 Level of understanding related to the\ndiabetes diagnosis, glucose monitor-\ning, home glucose goals, and when to\ncall the health care professionals.\n\u2022 De\ufb01nition, recognition, treatment,\nand prevention of hyperglycemia and\nhypoglycemia.\n\u2022 Information on making healthy food\nchoices at home and referral to an\noutpatient registered dietitian nutri-\ntionist or diabetes care and education\nspecialist to guide individualization of\nthe meal plan, if needed.\n\u2022 When and how to take blood glucose-\nlowering medications, including insulin\nadministration.\n\u2022 Sick-day management (29,153).\n\u2022 Proper use and disposal of diabetes\nsupplies, e.g., insulin pen, pen nee-\ndles, syringes, and lancets.\nPeople with diabetes must be pro-\nvided with appropriate durable medical\nequipment, medications, supplies (e.g.,\nblood glucose test strips or CGM sen-\nsors), prescriptions, and appropriate\neducation at the time of discharge to\navoid a potentially dangerous hiatus in\ncare.\nPREVENTING ADMISSIONS AND\nREADMISSIONS\nIn people with diabetes, the hospital re-\nadmission rate is between 14 and 20%,\nnearly twice that in people without diabe-\ntes (151,155). This may result in increased\ndiabetes distress and has signi\ufb01cant \ufb01nan-\ncial implications. Of people with diabetes\nwho are hospitalized, 30% have two or\nmore hospital stays, and these admis-\nsions account for over 50% of hospital\ncosts for diabetes (156). Factors contrib-\nuting to readmission include male sex,\nlonger duration of prior hospitalization,\nnumber of previous hospitalizations,\nnumber and severity of comorbidities,\nand lower socioeconomic and/or educa-\ntional status; scheduled home health\nvisits and timely ambulatory follow-up\ncare reduce readmission rates (151,155).\nWhile there is no standard to prevent re-\nadmissions, several successful strate-\ngies have been reported (151). These\ninclude targeting ketosis-prone people\nwith type 1 diabetes (157), insulin treat-\nment of individuals with admission A1C\n>9% (75 mmol/mol) (158), and the use\nof a transitional care model (159). For\npeople with diabetic kidney disease, col-\nlaborative patient-centered medical\nhomes may decrease risk-adjusted re-\nadmission rates (160). A 2018 published\nalgorithm based on demographic and\nclinical characteristics of people with di-\nabetes had only moderate predictive\npower but identi\ufb01ed a promising future\nstrategy (161).\nAge is also an important risk factor in\nhospitalization and readmission among\npeople with diabetes (refer to Section 13,\n\u201cOlder Adults,\u201d for detailed criteria).\nReferences\n1.

Members of the ADA Professional\nPractice Committee, a multidisciplinary expert committee, are responsible for up-\ndating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a de-\ntailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the\nevidence-grading system for ADA\u2019s clinical practice recommendations and a full\nlist of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction\nand Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are\ninvited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.\nManaging the daily health demands of diabetes can be challenging. People living\nwith diabetes should not have to face discrimination due to diabetes. By advocat-\ning for the rights of those with diabetes at all levels, the American Diabetes Associ-\nation (ADA) can help to ensure that they live a healthy and productive life. A\nstrategic goal of the ADA is for more children and adults with diabetes to live free\nfrom the burden of discrimination. The ADA is also focused on making sure cost is\nnot a barrier to successful diabetes management.\nOne tactic for achieving these goals has been to implement the ADA Standards of\nCare through advocacy-oriented position statements. The ADA publishes evidence-based,\npeer-reviewed statements on topics such as diabetes and employment, diabetes and\ndriving, insulin access and affordability, and diabetes management in certain settings such\nas schools, childcare programs, and detention facilities. In addition to the ADA\u2019s clinical\ndocuments, these advocacy statements are important tools in educating schools, employ-\ners, licensing agencies, policy makers, and others about the intersection of diabetes man-\nagement and the law and for providing scienti\ufb01cally supported policy recommendations.\nADVOCACY STATEMENTS\nThe following is a partial list of advocacy statements ordered by publication date, with\nthe most recent statement appearing \ufb01rst. A comprehensive list of advocacy state-\nments is available at professional.diabetes.org/content/key-statements-and-reports.\nInsulin Access and Affordability\nThe ADA\u2019s Insulin Access and Affordability Working Group compiled public informa-\ntion and convened a series of meetings with stakeholders throughout the insulin\nsupply chain to learn how each entity affects the cost of insulin for the consumer.\nTheir conclusions and recommendations are published in an ADA statement (1).\nDiabetes Care in the School Setting\nA sizable portion of a child\u2019s day is spent in school, so close communication with\nand training and cooperation of school personnel are essential to optimize diabetes\nDisclosure information for each author is\navailable at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc23-SDIS.\nSuggested citation: ElSayed NA, Aleppo G,\nAroda VR, et al., American Diabetes Association.\n17.

Refer\nto the published ADA position state-\nment for diabetes management infor-\nmation for students with diabetes in\nelementary and secondary school set-\ntings (2).\nCare of Young Children With\nDiabetes in the Childcare Setting\nVery young children (aged <6 years) with\ndiabetes have legal protections and can\nbe safely cared for by childcare professio-\nnals with appropriate training, access to\nresources, and a communication system\nwith parents and the child\u2019s diabetes health\ncare professional. Refer to the published\nADA position statement for information\non young children aged <6 years in set-\ntings such as daycare centers, preschools,\ncamps, and other programs (3).\nDiabetes and Driving\nPeople with diabetes who wish to oper-\nate motor vehicles are subject to various\nlicensing requirements applied by both\nstate and federal jurisdictions. For an\noverview of existing licensing rules for\npeople with diabetes, factors that impact\ndriving for this population, and general\nguidelines for assessing driver \ufb01tness and\ndetermining appropriate licensing restric-\ntions, refer to the published ADA position\nstatement (4).\nEditor\u2019s note: Federal commercial driv-\ning rules for individuals with insulin-\ntreated diabetes changed on 19 November\n2018. These changes will be re\ufb02ected in a\nfuture updated ADA statement.\nDiabetes and Employment\nAny person with diabetes, whether insulin\ntreated or noninsulin treated, should be\neligible for any employment for which\nthey are otherwise quali\ufb01ed. Employment\ndecisions should never be based on gen-\neralizations or stereotypes regarding the\neffects of diabetes. For a general set of\nguidelines for evaluating individuals with\ndiabetes for employment, including how\nan assessment should be performed and\nwhat changes (accommodations) in the\nworkplace may be needed for an individ-\nual with diabetes, refer to the published\nADA position statement (5).\nReferences\n1.

In \nobese individuals, the amount of nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, \nproinflammatory markers, and other substances that are involved in the development of insulin \nresistance, is increased. The pathogenesis in the development of diabetes is based on the fact \nthat the \u03b2-islet cells of the pancreas are impaired, causing a lack of control of blood glucose. The \ndevelopment of diabetes becomes more inevitable if the failure of \u03b2-islet cells of the pancreas \nis accompanied by insulin resistance. Weight gain and body mass are central to the formation \nand rising incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This literature review will demonstrate the \nfacts that link obesity with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. In conclusion, \nnew approaches in managing and preventing diabetes in obese individuals must be studied and \ninvestigated based on the facts.\nKeywords: diabetes mellitus, obesity, insulin resistance\nIntroduction\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disorder that can alter carbohydrate, protein, and fat \nmetabolism. It is caused by the absence of insulin secretion due to either the progressive \nor marked inability of the \u03b2-Langerhans islet cells of the pancreas to produce insulin, \nor due to defects in insulin uptake in the peripheral tissue. DM is broadly classified \nunder two categories, which include type 1 and type 2 diabetes.1\nType 1 diabetes occurs most commonly in children, but it can sometimes also \nappear in adult age groups, particularly in those in their late thirties and early forties. \nPatients with type 1 diabetes are generally not obese and frequently present with an \nemergency status known as diabetes ketoacidosis.2\nThe etiology of type 1 diabetes can be explained by damage to the pancreatic cells \ndue to environmental or infectious agents. In individuals who are susceptible to genetic \nalterations, the immune system is triggered to produce an immune response against \naltered \u03b2-cells, or against molecules in \u03b2-cells that are similar to viral proteins.3 Approxi\u00ad\nmately 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes show circulating islet cell antibodies, and \nmost of these patients have anti-insulin antibodies before receiving insulin therapy.4\nThe major factor in the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes is considered to be \nautoimmunity.5 There is a strong relationship between type 1 diabetes and other autoim\u00ad\nmune diseases such as Graves\u2019 disease, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, and Addison\u2019s disease. \nWhen these diseases are present, the prevalence rates of type 1 diabetes increase.6\nVitamin D plays a major role in the pathogenesis and prevention of type 1 diabetes, as \nrecent evidence suggests.5 In addition, vitamin D deficiency is an independent predictor \nVideo abstract\nPoint your SmartPhone at the code above.

Furthermore, another study has proved \nthat vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes may predict all \ncauses of mortality.7\nType 2 diabetes has a different pathophysiology and \netiology as compared to type 1 diabetes. The existence of \nmany new factors \u2013 for example, the increased prevalence of \nobesity among all age groups and both sex physical inactiv\u00ad\nity, poor diet, and urbanization \u2013 means that the number of \npatients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is rising.8 This finding \nis significant because it will allow health planners to make \nrational plans and reallocate health resources accordingly.9\nType 2 diabetes is described as a combination of low \namounts of insulin production from pancreatic \u03b2-cells and \nperipheral insulin resistance.10 Insulin resistance leads to \nelevated fatty acids in the plasma, causing decreased glu\u00ad\ncose transport into the muscle cells, as well as increased \nfat breakdown, subsequently leading to elevated hepatic \nglucose production. \u00adInsulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell \ndysfunction must occur simultaneously for type 2 diabetes \nto develop. Anyone who is overweight and/or obese has \nsome kind of insulin resistance, but diabetes only develops \nin those individuals who lack sufficient insulin secretion \nto match the degree of insulin resistance. Insulin in those \npeople may be high, yet it is not enough to normalize the \nlevel of glycemia.11\nDysfunction of \u03b2-cells is a main factor across the progres\u00ad\nsion from prediabetes to diabetes. After the progression from \nnormal glucose tolerance to abnormal glucose tolerance, \npostprandial blood glucose levels increase initially. There\u00ad\nafter, fasting hyperglycemia may develop as the suppression \nof hepatic gluconeogenesis fails.12 Despite the fact that the \npathophysiology of diabetes differs between type 1 and type 2 \ndiabetes, most of the complications are similar, which may \ninclude macrovascular and microvascular complications.13 \nAbnormal glycemia appears to contribute to microvascular \nand metabolic complications. However, macrovascular com\u00ad\nplications appear to be unrelated to glycemic abnormalities. \nInsulin resistance with lipid abnormalities (ie, low levels \nof high-density lipoprotein, and high levels of low-density \nlipoprotein and triglycerides), thrombotic abnormalities, as \nwell as atherosclerotic risk factors (for example, smoking, \nfamily history, and hypertension) determine the cardiovas\u00ad\ncular risk in a patient. Cardiovascular risk is associated with \nthe development of insulin resistance even before frank \nhyperglycemia exists. A hypothesis of complications called \nthe \u201cticking clock\u201d developed by Haffner et\u00a0al in 1999 showed \nthat the onset of hyperglycemia puts one at risk for developing \nmacrovascular complications at an earlier point, perhaps at \nthe onset of insulin resistance and before hyperglycemia.14\nObesity\nOverweight and obesity are defined by an excess accumula\u00ad\ntion of adipose tissue to an extent that impairs both physical \nand psychosocial health and well-being.15 Obesity is con\u00ad\nsidered a health disaster in both developed and developing \ncountries.16\nThe prevalence is escalating significantly in many nations \nworldwide. This pandemic needs to be stopped if the eco\u00ad\nnomic costs, social hazards, morbidity, and mortality of the \ndisease are considered.\nObesity and type 1 diabetes\nThe rising incidence of type 2 diabetes among children and \nadults is related to the epidemic of obesity. A similar etiology \nis also responsible for a similar increase in type 1 diabetes.17 \nWhile the underling pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes, \nwhich is autoimmune in nature, continues to be investigated \nand studied, the exact mechanism causing the rise in the \nincidence of type 1 diabetes remains unclear, particularly \nin young age groups. The DIAMOND (Diabetes Mondiale) \nstudy,18 which collected data on childhood diabetes from \n112 centers around the world, demonstrated an approximate \n2.8% annual increase in type 1 diabetes over the period from \n1989\u20132000.\nThe etiology of type 1 diabetes, according to twin studies, \nindicates a joint contribution of environmental and genetic \n\u00adfactors.8 Furthermore, the importance of environmental \nfactors in the etiology of diabetes is indicated by a sig\u00ad\nnificant rise in type 1 diabetes incidence in immigrants from \nlower to higher incidence regions. Multiple triggers for the \ndevelopment of type 1 diabetes have been investigated, \n\u00adincluding short-\u00adduration or the absence of breastfeeding, \nexposure to cow\u2019s milk protein, and exposure to some kind \nof infection such as enterovirus or rubella. However, none of \nthese triggering factors has been shown to be the definitive \ncause.19\nThe association between type 1 diabetes and weight gain \nwas first investigated by Baum et\u00a0al20 in 1975. The Baum \net\u00a0al study suggested that there was an association related to \noverfeeding or to hormonal dysregulation.20\nThe \u201caccelerator hypothesis\u201d proposed by Wilkin21 is con\u00ad\nsidered one of the most accepted theories that demonstrates \nthe association between body mass and type 1 diabetes. The \nauthors of this theory suggested that increasing body weight \nin young age groups increases the risk of developing type 1",

There is an inverse relationship between body mass \nindex and age at diagnosis. Furthermore, as young children \ngain more weight, diabetes can be diagnosed earlier. This is \nexplained by the fact that more weight accelerates insulin \nresistance, leading to the development of type 1 diabetes \nin individuals who are predisposed genetically to diabetes. \n\u00adFollowing this study, many papers were published support\u00ad\ning Wilkin\u2019s accelerator hypotheses. One study conducted \nin the United States in 2003 showed a significant increase \nin the prevalence of being overweight in children with type \n1 diabetes, from 12.6% in the period 1979\u20131989 to 36.8% \nin the period 1990\u20131998. To date, the exact mechanism and \nrelationship between type 1 diabetes and obesity remains \ninconclusive and needs further explanation.21\nObesity and type 2 diabetes\nThe increased prevalence of obesity these days has drawn \nattention to the worldwide significance of this problem.17 \nIn the US, approximately two-thirds of the adult popula\u00ad\ntion is considered to be overweight or obese. Similar trends \nare being noticed worldwide.22 Obesity is linked to many \nmedical, psychological, and social conditions, the most \ndevastating of which may be type 2 diabetes. At the start \nof this century, 171 million people were estimated to have \ntype 2 diabetes, and this figure is expected to increase to \n360 million by 2030.23\nBoth type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with \ninsulin resistance. Most obese individuals, despite being \ninsulin resistant, do not develop hyperglycemia. Pancreatic \n\u03b2-cells of the islet of Langerhans release adequate amounts \nof insulin that are sufficient to overcome insulin level reduc\u00ad\ntions under normal circumstances, thus maintaining normal \nglucose tolerance.11\nThroughout the natural history of type 2 diabetes, \nendothelial dysfunction is accompanied with obesity/\ninsulin resistance in diabetes and prediabetes conditions \n(this includes people with impaired glucose tolerance and/or \nimpaired fasting glucose). In order to develop insulin resis\u00ad\ntance and obesity, thereby causing type 2 diabetes, \u03b2-cells \nshould not be able to compensate fully for decreased insulin \nsensitivity. The nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) that are \nsecreted from adipose tissue in obese people may lead to the \nhypothesis that insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction are \nmost likely linked.24\nObesity and insulin resistance\nInsulin sensitivity fluctuation occurs across the natural life \ncycle. For example, insulin resistance is noticed during \npuberty, in pregnancy, and during the aging process.25 In \naddition, lifestyle variations, such as increased carbohy\u00ad\ndrate intake and increased physical activity, are associated \nwith insulin sensitivity fluctuations.10 Obesity is considered \nthe most important factor in the development of metabolic \ndiseases. Adipose tissue affects metabolism by secreting \nhormones, glycerol, and other substances including leptin, \ncytokines, adiponectin, and proinflammatory substances, and \nby releasing NEFAs. In obese individuals, the secretion of \nthese substances will be increased.25\nThe cornerstone factor affecting insulin insensitivity is the \nrelease of NEFAs. Increased release of NEFAs is observed \nin type 2 diabetes and in obesity, and it is associated with \ninsulin resistance in both conditions.26 Shortly after an \nacute increase of plasma NEFA levels in humans, insulin \nresistance starts to develop. Conversely, when the level of \nplasma NEFA decreases, as in the case with antilipolytic \nagent use, peripheral insulin uptake and glucose monitoring \nwill be improved.27\nInsulin sensitivity is determined by another critical factor, \nwhich is body fat distribution. Insulin resistance is associated \nwith body mass index at any degree of weight gain. Insulin \nsensitivity also differs completely in lean individuals because \nof differences in body fat distribution. Individuals whose fat \ndistribution is more peripheral have more insulin sensitivity \nthan do individuals whose fat distribution is more central \n(ie, in the abdomen and chest area).25\nDifferences in adipose tissue distribution help explain, \nto some extent, how the metabolic effects of subcutaneous \nand intra-abdominal fat differ. Intra-abdominal fat is more \nrelated to the genes that secrete proteins and the specific \ntypes of proteins responsible for the production of energy. \nAdiponectin secretion by omental adipocytes is larger than \nthe amount secreted by subcutaneous-derived adipocytes. \nMoreover, the quantity secreted from these omental adipo\u00ad\ncytes is negatively associated with increased body weight.26 \nThe secretion of NEFAs to different tissue may be affected \nby their source.\nFurthermore, abdominal fat is considered more lipolytic \nthan subcutaneous fat, and it also does not respond easily \nto the antilipolytic action of insulin, which makes intra-\nabdominal fat more important in causing insulin resistance, \nand thus diabetes.27,28\nMarcial et\u00a0al29 further explained the molecular mecha\u00ad\nnisms of insulin resistance, inflammation, and the devel\u00ad\nopment of diabetes. One of the mechanisms of insulin is \nits effect as an anabolic hormone that enhances glycogen \nsynthesis in liver and muscle. This in turn augments protein",

Insulin \nresistance is indeed an important factor in disease process. \nFat storage and mobilization are other important factors \ncausing insulin resistance.\nObesity and \u03b2-cell dysfunction\n\u03b2-cells play a vital role in regulating insulin release, despite \ntheir fragility. The quantity of insulin released by \u03b2-cells \nfluctuates and changes according to the quantity, nature, and \nroute of administration of the stimulus. Therefore, \u03b2-cells \nplay a very important role in ensuring that in healthy subjects, \nconcentrations of blood glucose are stable within a relatively \nnormal physiological range. In obesity, insulin sensitivity, as \nwell as the modulation of \u03b2-cell function, decreases.30\nInsulin-resistant individuals, whether slim or fat, have more \ninsulin responses and lower hepatic insulin clearance than those \nwho are insulin sensitive. In a normal healthy subject, there \nis a continuous feedback relationship between the \u03b2-cells and \nthe insulin-sensitive tissues.10 If the adipose tissue, liver, and \nmuscles demand glucose, this will lead to increased insulin \nsupply by the \u03b2-cells. If the glucose levels require stability, \nchanges in insulin sensitivity must be matched by a relatively \nopposite change in circulating insulin levels. Failure of this \nprocess to take place results in a deregulation of glucose levels \nand the development of DM. If the \u03b2-cells are healthy, there is \nan adaptive response to insulin resistance, which leads to the \nmaintenance of normal levels of glucose. By contrast, when \npancreatic \u03b2-cells are impaired, abnormal glucose tolerance \nor abnormal fasting glucose may develop, and it may even be \nfollowed by the development of type 2 diabetes.30\nA continued decline in \u03b2-cell function is one of the main \ncauses leading to type 2 diabetes. According to literature, when \n\u03b2-cell dysfunction causes inadequate insulin secretion, fasting \nblood glucose and postprandial blood glucose will elevate.31 \nSubsequently, the decreased efficiency of hepatic and muscle \nglucose uptake will occur, with the absence or incomplete inhi\u00ad\nbition of liver glucose production. Further increases in blood \nglucose levels will lead to disease severity through glucotoxic \neffects on the pancreatic \u03b2-cells and negative effects on insulin \nuptake and peripheral tissue sensitivity.31\nConversely, in healthy subjects, elevating their blood \nglucose levels for 20 hours or more has an absolutely inverse \naction, because it will lead to enhanced \u03b2-cell function \ncapacity and improve peripheral insulin uptake.16 These \nfacts explain that a genetic risk factor is necessary for the \noccurrence of \u03b2-cell function impairment. The progression of \ntime, as well as a pre-existing genetic abnormality in insulin \nsecretion and a subsequently continuous elevation of blood \nglucose levels, lead to complete \u03b2-cell failure.24\nA second factor that might contribute to a continuous \nloss of function of \u03b2-cells is increasing plasma NEFA \u00adlevels. \nDespite the fact that NEFAs play a major role in insulin \nrelease, the continuous exposure to NEFAs is related to sig\u00ad\nnificant malfunction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion \npathways and reduced insulin biosynthesis. Moreover, the \noccurrence of insulin resistance in vivo and a failure of the \ncompensatory mechanism of \u03b2-cells in humans contributes \nto increase amounts of NEFA levels produced by lipids.32\nThe two actions of NEFA contribute to a significant \netiology that links \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance \nin people with type 2 diabetes, and those who are at risk for \nthe disease. The effect of lipotoxic increases in plasma NEFA \nlevels and the rise of glucose levels might produce a more \nharmful effect known as glucolipotoxicity.33,34\nConclusion\nDiabetes and obesity are chronic disorders that are on the \nrise worldwide. Body mass index has a strong relationship \nto diabetes and insulin resistance. In an obese individual, the \namount of NEFA, glycerol, hormones, cytokines, proinflam\u00ad\nmatory substances, and other substances that are involved in \nthe development of insulin resistance are increased. Insulin \nresistance with impairment of \u03b2-cell function leads to the \ndevelopment of diabetes. Gaining weight in early life is \nassociated with the development of type 1 diabetes. NEFA \nis a cornerstone in the development of insulin resistance and \nin the impairment of \u03b2-cell function. New approaches in \nmanaging and preventing diabetes in obese individuals must \nbe studied and investigated based on these facts.\nDisclosure\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.\nReferences\n1.\t Scheen AJ.

In \nindividuals who are obese, higher amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, \nand pro-inflammatory cytokines that could participate in the development of insulin resis\u00ad\ntance are released by adipose tissue. Besides, endoplasmic reticulum stress, adipose tissue \nhypoxia, oxidative stress, lipodystrophy, and genetic background have a role in insulin \nresistance. However, no effective drug therapy was developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus \ntargeting these physiological factors. This is might be due to a lack of agreement on the \ncomprehensive mechanism of insulin resistance. Therefore, this review assesses the cellular \ncomponents of each physiologic and pathophysiologic factors that are involved in obesity \nassociated insulin resistance, and may encourage further drug development in this field. \nKeywords: obesity, insulin, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus\nIntroduction\nInsulin is a hormone secreted by \u03b2 cells of islets of Langerhans, controls the \nmetabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats by stimulating the absorption of \nmolecules like glucose from the blood into fat, skeletal muscle cell, and liver.1 \nA reduction in insulin signaling primarily in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/ \nphosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) axis triggers insulin \nresistance that could affect the metabolic actions of insulin.2 Insulin resistance is \ncommonly linked with obesity, which is a pathophysiologic factor of type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM).3,4 An extreme adipose tissue expansion due to an \nincrease in nutrients intake and insufficient energetic expenditure is considered \nas Obesity. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus is a complex chronic illness \nmanifested by a high level of blood glucose or hyperglycemia, resulting from \ndeficiencies in insulin secretion, action, or both.5 Obesity could cause chronic \nlow-grade systemic and local inflammation that leads to the emergence of \ninsulin resistance linked diabetes mellitus even though the mechanism is not \nclear.3,6 In addition, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can contribute to \nthe development of obesity.6 Therefore, the objective of this review is to high\u00ad\nlight the mechanisms of obesityassociated insulin resistance in T2DM through \ninduction of inflammation, adipocyte dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic \nreticulum stress (ER stress), aging, hypoxia, and change in genetic makeup. \nBecause understanding the impairment of insulin signaling which is related to \nobesity-induced diabetes may lead to better pharmacological strategies not only \nfor the treatment of but also for the prevention of obesity and T2DM.\nCorrespondence: Yohannes Tsegyie \nWondmkun Department of Pharmacology \nand Clinical Pharmacy, School of \nPharmacy, College of Health Sciences,  \nAddis Ababa University, P.O.

    "text": "Mechanisms of Obesity Induced- \nInsulin Resistance\nObesity escalates the pathogenesis of T2DM through sti\u00ad\nmulation of insulin resistance. T2DM treatment has been \nrestricted by little understanding of insulin resistance. \nHowever, several studies described the association \nbetween mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, hyper\u00ad\ninsulinemia, and lipotoxicity with insulin resistance.7 \nEndoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, genetic \nbackground, aging, hypoxia, and lipodystrophy are also \nstated in the pathogenesis of T2DM through induction of \ninsulin resistance. Nevertheless, none of those concepts \nhas led to the discovery of effective drugs for T2DM. \nThe reason might be lack of agreement for cross-linked \nmechanisms of insulin resistance in T2DM.7 In the follow\u00ad\ning sections, different physiological changes that are \ninvolved in obesity-associated insulin resistance will be \ndiscussed in part.\nInflammation-Induced Insulin \nResistance\nElevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or an \nincreased number of white blood cells in the blood or \ntissue are described by inflammation. Overstimulation of \ninflammatory process frequently leads to various abnorm\u00ad\nalities such as organ dysfunction and tissue injury. Obesity \nmight cause chronic and low-grade inflammation that is \ninvolved in T2DM. In addition, adipose-specific cytokines \n(leptin, adiponectin, and inflammatory cytokines (tumor \nnecrotic factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) are \nsecreted by visceral adipocytes. An elevated amount of \nadipose tissue draining into the portal vein, chemokines, \nand IL-6 production can induce liver and systemic insulin \nresistance.7,8\nMoreover, visceral adipose depot and adipocyte size in \nhumans are also related to insulin resistance.8 The predis\u00ad\nposition of visceral adipose tissue for elevated inflamma\u00ad\ntion and the subsequent secretion of cytokines that alter \ninsulin signaling may considerably contribute to insulin \nresistance in obesity. The levels of the macrophage- \nderived apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage protein that \nstimulates lipolysis in adipose tissue and responsible for \nlocal recruitment of adipose tissue macrophages are also \nincreased with obesity.6,9 Furthermore, saturated fatty \nacids (FAs), glucose, and changes in gut microbiota have \nbeen considered as triggers of metabolic inflammation \nthrough the stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors \n(PRRs) such as; toll-like receptors (TLR), nucleotide oli\u00ad\ngomerization domain (NOD), and inflammasome.10,11 \nThese eventually increase pro-inflammatory cytokines pro\u00ad\nduction and immune cell recruitment like T lymphocytes \nand macrophages in metabolic tissues. These pro-inflam\u00ad\nmatory cytokines activate numerous kinases that interfere \nwith insulin signaling and insulin action in adipocytes and \nhepatocyte.12 Different studies reported that drugs that \nsuppress inflammation improve insulin sensitivity and \nenhance glucose regulation in T2DM insulin-resistant \npatients.13,14 For instance, salsalate, TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors (eta\u00ad\nnercept, infliximab, adalimumab), IL-1\u03b2 antagonists like \ncanakinumab, thiazolidinediones, and metformin are found \nto \nbe \nanti-diabetes \ndrugs \nwith \nanti-inflammatory \nproperties.14\nToll-Like Receptors in Insulin \nResistance\nToll-like receptors (TLR) are found under the family of \nPRRs play an indispensable function in innate immunity \nand identify tissue injury by the danger-associated mole\u00ad\ncular patterns. Studies reported that, among the different \ntypes of TLR, TLR2 and TLR4 have a role in inflamma\u00ad\ntion-associated insulin resistance during obesity.15,16 In \nobese mice and humans with diabetes, the expression of \nTLR4 in adipocytes, hepatocytes, muscles, and in the \nhypothalamus is increased and negatively affects insulin \nsensitivity.15 Another study also revealed that, during obe\u00ad\nsity, metabolic endotoxemia triggers the development of \ninflammation and metabolic disorders by activating TLR4 \nin metabolic tissues.16 On the other hand, the abrogation of \nTLR4 leads to the reduction of oxidative stress by meta\u00ad\nbolic reprogramming of mitochondria in visceral fat, alle\u00ad\nviating obesity-induced insulin resistance.17 In addition, \nvarious TLR inhibitors have been developed to regulate \nexcessive inflammation; these are; small molecule inhibi\u00ad\ntors, \nantibodies, \noligonucleotides, \nlipid-A \nanalogs, \nmicroRNAs, and emerging nano-inhibitors.18\nMitochondrial Dysfunction in Insulin \nResistance\nA decrease in mitochondrial function might be associated \nwith insulin resistance and T2DM since it facilitates the \nectopic accumulation of fat in muscles and adipose tissues. \nInsulin resistance is linked substantially with an increased \namount of triglycerides in muscle and liver in elder \npatients. These might cause a decrease in both \nWondmkun                                                                                                                                                           \nDovepress\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nDovePress                                                                                           \nDiabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2020:13 \n3612",

    "text": "mitochondrial oxidative activity and ATP synthesis; both \nare indicators of a decrease in the function of \nmitochondria.19 In other studies, a decrease in muscle \nmitochondria number by low expression of nuclear- \nencoded genes that control mitochondrial biogenesis, \nsuch \nas \nperoxisome \nproliferator-activated \nreceptor \ngamma (PPAR\u03b3) coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and PGC-1\u03b2 \nproduces intramyocellular fat accumulation in the insulin- \nresistant subjects.19,20 Accordingly, PGC-1\u03b1 has gained \nattention as a very attractive target for diabetic therapy \ndue to its role in lipid and glucose metabolism. \nPharmacological activation of PGC-1\u03b1 is thought to result \nin health benefits. Nevertheless, this notion has been chal\u00ad\nlenged by growing evidence indicating that insulin resis\u00ad\ntance is increased when PGC-1\u03b1 is well beyond normal \nphysiological limits.21\nEndocrine Mechanisms of Insulin \nResistance\nEnergy storage depots for triglycerides synthesis is the \nessential role of adipocytes. They also act as endocrine \ncells, thereby secrete many peptide hormones and cyto\u00ad\nkines such as TNF-\u03b1, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1, \nwhich involves maintaining the level of angiotensinogen \nand its proteolytic product that controls vasoconstriction; \nand leptin, which participates in energy mobilization.22 In \naddition, active steroid hormones, including estrogen and \ncortisol can be produced by adipose tissue. Over such \nproduced molecules, adipocytes retain the capacity to per\u00ad\nform their local functions and systemic metabolism in \ndifferent organs like muscle, brain, liver, gonads, \u03b2-cells, \nlymphoid organs, and blood vessels. This assumption \nincreases several possibilities for the further association \nbetween adipocyte function/mass and insulin resistance.22 \nFor instance, in the T2DM mouse model, leptin enhanced \ninsulin resistance and hyperglycemia.23 Impaired leptin \nsignaling may contribute to low adiponectin expression \nin obese individuals. Increased leptin signaling can there\u00ad\nfore be a focus for therapies aimed at raising adiponectin \nexpression, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving \nthe cardiometabolic profile of obesity.24\nAdipokines Role in Insulin \nResistance\nPatients with T2DM and insulin resistance often exhibit \nsigns of impaired metabolism, deposition, and concentra\u00ad\ntion of lipids in the skeletal muscle and blood.25 An \nabundance of free FAs in the plasma reduces insulin-regu\u00ad\nlated glucose metabolism, whereas a low level of lipid in \nthe plasma enhances insulin function in the adipocytes, \nliver and skeletal muscle cells. Increasing plasma FAs in \nhumans and rodents reduce insulin activation of IRS-1- \nlinked PI-3K activity in skeletal muscle. Insulin resistance \nassociated with lipid has also been shown to be linked to \ndefects in translocation of glucose transporter 4 \n(GLUT4).26 In addition, various adipokines (such as adi\u00ad\nponectin, TNF-\u03b1, resistin, and IL) are involved in this \ndisease state.27 Thus, an increase in the level of adiponec\u00ad\ntin enhances insulin sensitivity while resistin exhibits insu\u00ad\nlin-antagonistic effects. Resistin induces insulin resistance \nthrough inhibition of glucose transport in vitro and \nincreases hepatic glucose production and fasting blood \nglucose concentrations in vivo.26 A study found that tre\u00ad\nlagliptin succinate reduced the content of resistance \nsecreted by fat cells, suggesting that trelagliptin can reduce \ninsulin resistance in fat cells.28\nNeural Mechanisms of Insulin \nResistance\nStudies revealed that our brain receives information from \ninsulin and leptin, the transducer of adiposity signals, and \nintegrates this input with signals from nutrients such as \nFAs. Thereafter, the brain sends signals to regulate the \nmetabolism of macromolecules and feeding behavior to \nmaintain homeostasis of fuel metabolism and energy \nstores.29,30 Peripheral metabolism of glucose is controlled \nby both leptin and insulin. Peripheral and brain IRs are \nvery crucial for normal insulin function, even though \nglucose homeostasis in mice with reduced hepatic IRs is \naltered by the central administration of insulin. Moreover, \nhypothalamic IRs function inhibition results in impaired \nhepatic glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. \nInterestingly, leptin and insulin both enhance the expres\u00ad\nsion of suppressor of cytokine signals-3 (SOCS-3) and \nsensitivity to both leptin and insulin is increased in mice \nwith reduced SOCS-3 neuronal expression.31\nExcessive and Ectopic Lipid \nDeposition Induced Insulin \nResistance\nThe storage capacity of single adipocytes is limited, \nalthough they have a highly advanced ability to sequester \nfat.32,33 Following a short-term high-fat diet enlarged adi\u00ad\npocytes trigger insulin resistance in the absence of much \nDovepress                                                                                                                                                           \nWondmkun\nDiabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2020:13                                         \nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com                                                                 \nDovePress                                                               \n3613",

    "text": "macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue.34 Hence, \nexcess lipid in adipose cells results in insulin resistance \neven without inflammatory responses. This might be jus\u00ad\ntified as, excessive and ectopic lipid accumulation in adi\u00ad\npocytes, liver, muscle, and outside may cause insulin \nresistance through metabolically toxic product formation. \nFor instance, ceramide production has been increased by \nsaturated FAs, which in return contributes to insulin \nresistance.34,35\nIn addition, the level of hepatic diacylglycerol shows a \nstrong association with systemic insulin resistance, espe\u00ad\ncially in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These lipids may \nactivate signaling pathways that negatively impact insulin \nsignal transduction like one or more of the protein kinase \nC proteins. Incomplete FA oxidation products may also \naffect the steps in the insulin signaling cascade or the \npathways it controls.35\nGenetic Factors Related Insulin \nResistance\nNot only insulin receptors and IRS-1 gene polymorphisms \naffect insulin signals, but also polymorphisms of other \ngenes such as; uncoupling protein gene, \u03b23 of the adrener\u00ad\ngic receptor gene and GLUT-4 gene associated with visc\u00ad\neral obesity may promote insulin resistance.36 A study \nrevealed that T2DM patients and their relatives showed \nreduced total-body glucose disposal stimulation by insulin \ncompared to control subjects. This glucose disposal \nimpairment was mainly associated with the reduction in \ninsulin-mediated storage of glucose in the form of glyco\u00ad\ngen. The rate of total-body glucose disposal in subjects \nwith normal fasting glucose concentrations is also affected \nby the levels of GLUT-4 mRNA and GLUT-4 protein.37\nEndoplasmic Reticulum Stress \nInduced Insulin Resistance\nStudy revealed that ER stress and unfolded protein \nresponse are the central factors for T2DM, post-burn insu\u00ad\nlin resistance, and stress-induced diabetes pathogenesis.38 \nProtein synthesis and folding of secreted and membrane- \nbound proteins take place in the ER. Enhanced unfolded \nand/or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen may be caused \nby the depletion of calcium stores from the ER. The \npresence of a high level of misfolded proteins results in \nthe activation of signaling pathways to restore homeostasis \nand may lead to insulin resistance.38\nAdipose Tissue Hypoxia-Induced \nInsulin Resistance\nStudies showed that, in obese animals, hypoxia response \nin adipose tissue is common. The results of most studies \non adipose tissue hypoxia have revealed the presence of \na strong association between adipose tissue hypoxia \n(ATH) and major chronic disorders like obesity patho\u00ad\ngenesis. ATH may stimulate cellular mechanisms for \nleptin elevation, mitochondrial dysfunction, macrophage \ninfiltration, chronic inflammation, adiponectin reduction, \nER stress, and adipocyte death in obese individuals.39 In \naddition, inhibition of adipogenesis and triglyceride \nsynthesis by hypoxia may be a new mechanism for \nelevated FAs in the blood during obesity. Therefore, \nATH may represent a combined cellular mechanism for \nmany metabolic disorders and insulin resistance in \npatients with metabolic syndrome. ATP also involves \nin the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and inflamma\u00ad\ntion-induced obstructive sleep apnea.40 An inverse asso\u00ad\nciation has been also observed between increasing body \nmass index and decreasing insulin receptor expression in \nvisceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese humans. VAT- \nspecific insulin receptor downregulation is an early \nevent in obesity-related adipose cell dysfunction that \nenhances systemic insulin resistance in both obese \nhumans and mice by decreasing insulin receptor \nmRNA stability by activating micro RNA-128 (miR- \n128) that lowers insulin receptor expression in \nadipocytes.41\nAging and Insulin Resistance\nObesity enhances the aging of adipose tissue, a process \nonly now beginning to come to light at the molecular \nlevel. Studies in mice reveal that obesity increases reactive \noxygen species formation in fat cells, shortens telomeres, \nand eventually results in inactivation of the p53 tumor \nsuppressor, inflammation, and the elevation of insulin \nresistance.42 Inflammation and insulin resistance in adi\u00ad\npose tissue is increased by transgenic overexpression of \np53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (Cdkn1a). In \na similar study, p53 which is derived from adipocytes and \nmacrophages contributes to adipose tissue aging in obese \nanimals. This is because p53 is activated in response to \nshortened telomeres in aging cells. Mice without telomer\u00ad\nase (Tert) produce shorter telomeres with successive gen\u00ad\nerations and ultimately become infertile by the fourth to \nsixth generation (G4\u2013G6).42,43\nWondmkun                                                                                                                                                           \nDovepress\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nDovePress                                                                                           \nDiabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy 2020:13 \n3614",

The more fatty tissue\none has, the more resistant the cells become to insulin. However, one does not have to be overweight \nto develop type 2 diabetes.\nInadequate physical activity: the less active one is, the more likely one is to develop type 2 diabetes. \nPhysical activity helps one control weight, use glucose as energy and increase the sensitivity of the cells to insulin.\nUnhealthy diet: a diet rich in calories, saturated fats and sugar, and low in fibre can lead to an increase in \nbody weight and thereby increase the risk for developing diabetes. Having high blood pressure or \na high lipid level also puts a person at risk of developing diabetes.\nGestational diabetes: women who developed diabetes during pregnancy have a higher risk of developing \ntype 2 diabetes.

Three out of four people with diabetes live in low- and \n\u2022\u2022\nmiddle-income countries. \nIn the South-East Asia (SEA) Region, nearly 71 million were estimated to be living with diabetes in 2010 and an \n\u2022\u2022\nequal number had impaired glucose tolerance. \nNearly 3.4 million people globally and 1 million in SEA Region die from consequences of high blood sugar every \n\u2022\u2022\nyear.\nDiabetes exacerbates major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), malaria and HIV/AIDS. People with \n\u2022\u2022\ndiabetes are three times more likely to develop TB when infected and approximately 15% of TB globally is \nthought to be due to diabetes.\nWhat is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when blood glucose levels remain above normal limits. This happens if the \npancreas does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body cannot effectively \nuse the insulin it produces. Type 1 diabetes is due to deficient insulin production while Type 2 diabetes results from \nthe body\u2019s ineffective use of insulin. Over 90% of individuals with diabetes around the world have Type 2 diabetes. \nGestational diabetes is the type of diabetes that is first recognized during pregnancy.\nWhat are the causes/risk factors for diabetes?\nThe causes of Type 1 diabetes, while not known, may be diverse such as autoimmune, genetic or environmental.\n\u2022\u2022\nRisk factors for Type 2 diabetes are overweight/obesity, family history of diabetes, tobacco use, excess alcohol \n\u2022\u2022\nintake, prior history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and physical inactivity.\nWhat are the symptoms of diabetes?\nType 1 diabetes: Symptoms include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive \n\u2022\u2022\nthirst (polydipsia), constant hunger,  weight loss, very dry skin, vision changes \nand fatigue.\nType 2 diabetes: Symptoms may be similar to those of Type 1 diabetes, but \n\u2022\u2022\nare often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several \nyears after onset, once complications have already arisen. Impaired glucose \ntolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are intermediate conditions and \nrisk categories for future development of diabetes.\nWhat are the complications of diabetes?\nRaised blood sugar due to uncontrolled diabetes leads to serious damage to many \nof the body\u2019s systems over time. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and \nstroke. Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as \na result of long-term accumulated damage to small blood vessels in the retina. \nDiabetic neuropathy in the feet increases the chance of foot ulcers and eventual \nlimb amputation. Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failure. The \noverall risk of dying among people with diabetes is at least double the risk of \ntheir peers without diabetes.\nDiabetes\nFact Sheet\n1 million die every year in  \nSEA Region from  \nconsequences of high  \nblood sugar.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the global burden of \ndiabetes at 135 million cases in 1995, in a worldwide adult population of under 4 billion, \nand has projected that there will be 299 million cases by the year 2025. Although WHO \nrecently accorded priority status to diabetes mellitus, many public health planners remain \nlargely unaware of its magnitude and the seriousness of its complications. Of equal \nconsequence, is the increasing prevalence of the disease and the long-term cost of therapy \nfor both patients and the health sector, and its cost to nations in economic terms. \nIn the Eastern Mediterranean Region, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence \nof diabetes mellitus, consisting mainly of type 2. It is now the fourth leading cause of \ndeath in the Region. An estimated 22 million people have diabetes, out of a total adult \npopulation of 290 million. Studies conducted in different populations of the Region \nhave reported high prevalence rates varying from 7% to 25% in the adult population. In \naddition, many countries are now reporting the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus at an \nincreasingly young age. People are presenting with type 2 in their twenties and thirties, \nand in some countries it is emerging in children. This pattern of younger age of onset \nextends the potential burden of therapy and complications to an even younger age group \nand for a longer period of an individual\u2019s lifespan. \nThere are a number of factors that might explain the increasing prevalence of diabetes \nmellitus in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, not least of all the significant social and \neconomic changes which are being experienced. Rates of obesity are increasing, while \npeople are becoming less physically active; both of these factors increase the risk of \ndeveloping diabetes. In addition, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases with \nage, and there is evidence that the current life expectancy in the majority of Eastern \nMediterranean countries now exceeds 65 years.\nThe WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has set goals and targets \nfor diabetes mellitus prevention at the regional level. Because of the importance of \ndiabetes and its complications in the Region, care should be considered a health priority \nand should be supported and strengthened by data collection, the establishment of \nnational epidemiological studies, and the formulation of national plans. One promising \ninitiative during the past few years has been the development of national diabetes control \nprogrammes in several countries of the Region; in others, committees to develop such \nIn the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful",

The prevalence of diabetes in \nthe Region and the high morbidity that is associated with it stimulated the WHO Regional \nOffice for the Eastern Mediterranean to develop these guidelines in order to address all \npractical issues relevant to the day-to-day management of glucose and its metabolic \ndisorders, with respect to reduction in related morbidity and mortality.\nThe framework for the guidelines was discussed in the Regional Consultation on \nDiabetes Prevention and Care, Teheran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2\u20135 February 2003. \nA consensus on major topics concerning diabetes prevention and care was formulated \nduring the consultation and the conclusions reached are given in Annex 1. Because of the \nneed for a standardized response to the challenge, the following regional strategies have \nbeen established for the prevention and care of diabetes: promotion of a healthy lifestyle; \nraising community awareness (eat less \u2013 walk more); primary prevention of diabetes; \nscreening for type 2 diabetes mellitus; establishment of a regional training course for \ndiabetes educators; and development of national strategy.\nManagement of diabetes mellitus, standards of care and clinical practical guidelines \nand Health education for people with diabetes, published by the Regional Office for the \nEastern Mediterranean in 1994 and 1996, respectively, provided reliable guidance on \nmanagement and education for diabetes in the Region. However, during the past 10 years, \nnew developments and rapid changes in management and prevention have occurred. The \npresent guidelines are intended to standardize management in the Region and include the \nlatest, evidence-based information for diabetes. They provide the information necessary \nfor decision-making by health care providers and patients themselves about disease \nmanagement in the most commonly encountered situations. The information is evidence-\nbased and clearly stated to facilitate the use of the guidelines in daily practice. The \ntarget population includes physicians at primary, secondary and tertiary level, general \npractitioners, internists and family medicine specialists, clinical dieticians, nurses and \npolicy-makers at ministries of health. Accompanying this publication are three quick \nreference cards relating to the management of diabetes, management of diabetes and \nhypertension and management of diabetes and dyslipidaemia. These will provide primary \nhealth care workers, physicians, consultants and clinicians with a readily accessible \nappraisal of the evidence-based facts relating to diabetes.",

It is estimated that about one half of \npersons with diabetes are unaware of their disease and, even in industrialized countries, \nmany individuals go undiagnosed. Although more recent data show that the proportion \nof undiagnosed cases has decreased, it is still at least about one quarter to one third of \nall persons with diabetes mellitus.\nIt is predicted that between 2000 and 2025, the size of the world\u2019s adult population \nwill increase from less than 4 billion to 5.5 billion, mainly on account of a 60% increase in \ndeveloping countries [1]. The number of adults with diabetes in the world is predicted to \nincrease from 150 million in 2000 to 300 million in 2025 [2]. In industrialized countries, \nthe number of diabetics will increase by about one third between 2000 and 2025, while \nin developing countries that number will more than double [2]. In 2025, more than 75% \nof the world\u2019s diabetic population will be living in developing countries. \nDiabetes prevalence in some Eastern Mediterranean countries is among the highest \nin the world [3\u201316]. The Eastern Mediterranean Region extends from Pakistan in the \neast to Morocco in the west, and the population is a mosaic of several ethnic groups. The \nage distribution pattern of the population is pyramidal, with about 50% of the population \naged below 20 years. \nWhile the majority of persons with diabetes mellitus in industrialized countries \nare in the older age group, the majority in developing countries tend to be middle-aged \nand at the most productive stage of life [3]. Many Eastern Mediterranean countries \nare now reporting the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus at an increasingly young age. \nSubjects are presenting in their second and third decade, and in some countries type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus is emerging in children. This pattern of onset at a younger age extends \nthe potential burden of therapy and complications to an even younger age group and \nfor a longer period of an individual\u2019s lifespan [2,4\u201315]. In the Eastern Mediterranean \nRegion as a whole, approximately half of the countries have published incidence rates. \nThe highest rates are reported in Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman and Qatar where the \nincidence of type 1 diabetes is reported to be 8\u201310 per 100 000 population per year in \nchildren aged <15 years while in Pakistan it is only 1 per 100 000 [4\u201314].",

    "text": "10 \nGuidelines for the prevention, management and care of diabetes mellitus\nOver the past three decades, key social and economic changes have occurred in \nthe majority Eastern Mediterranean nations. These include progressive urbanization, \ndecreasing infant mortality and increased life expectancy. Increasingly sedentary \nlifestyles, the obesity pandemic and higher life expectancy have led to a dramatic rise \nin type 2 diabetes in many countries of the Region [4\u201314,16]. Traditional activities and \ndietary patterns that have sustained people over generations are rapidly disappearing and \nthe socioeconomic situation in many countries has forced people to move to urbanized \nareas to seek employment, where they are less likely to lead a healthy lifestyle. Thus, it \nis estimated that in the Eastern Mediterranean Region 22 million people (out of a total \nadult population of 290 million) have diabetes mellitus, and it is predicted that this figure \nmight increase to 30 million by 2025 [2,3]. In the Region, the diabetes prevalence rate \nfor adults is 14.5%; however, recent studies conducted in different population groups \nhave reported diabetes prevalence rates as high as 20% in the United Arab Emirates [12], \n16% in Qatar and 15% in Bahrain. Even in much less affluent Pakistan the prevalence \nis 11% [4\u201314]. Studies in four countries of the Region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the \nUnited Arab Emirates) showed their current diabetes prevalence rates to be among the \nten highest in the world, and a similar situation applies for impaired glucose tolerance \n(IGT) prevalence. As in many other countries with high diabetes mellitus prevalence, \nthe onset of type 2 tends to occur at a relatively young age [5,7,10,12].

It constitutes a considerable financial burden on individuals, \ntheir families, the health sector and governments. \nIn most countries of the Region, specialized diabetes centres are few and far apart \nand often not within reach of many people with diabetes [2\u201320].

The majority of Eastern Mediterranean countries were found to have national \nplans for the prevention of diabetes and had already established national guidelines for \nthe prevention and management (Table 3). More than 50% of Eastern Mediterranean \ncountries reported having diabetes control plans. Effective preventive strategies, \ntherefore, already exist but are not being rationally or widely utilized. The management \nof diabetes needs to be monitored through implementation of national strategies for \noptimal control of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity.\nIn the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, specifically, diabetes mellitus is an \nimportant public health disorder for many reasons. Not only are the risk factors associated \nwith diabetes mellitus ever increasing, but the individual with diabetes frequently makes \nhis or her decisions concerning the disease outside the clinical setting, either at home, \non the job, or within his/her existing community. Many individuals are influenced by \ntraditional beliefs, myths and misconceptions regarding the causes, symptoms and care \nof diabetes mellitus and continue to seek alternative measures for curing their condition. \nHowever, the disease is not only a problem for the individual but is also a societal \nchallenge because of its serious complications and cost of treatment. Meanwhile, public \nawareness and understanding of diabetes remains very low in certain areas.\nThere are many important issues that the Region needs to address, not least of \nwhich is the lack of available mortality data. There is also a need for training of health \nprofessionals and paramedics on diabetes mellitus prevention and control. There is a lack \nof information on health care services management for diabetes mellitus as well as a lack \nof effort to assess the cost-effectiveness of the various interventions [18\u201320].\nTable 3.

The effects of diabetes mellitus include long-term damage, dysfunction and \nfailure of various organs\u201d [21]. Thus, the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes result \nfrom inadequate insulin action on target tissues, due to deficient insulin secretion or \ninsensitivity to insulin action, or a combination of both [2,22].\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic individual should never be made on \nthe basis of a single abnormal glucose value. Verification of the diagnosis with repeat \ntesting is required, unless an individual presents with unequivocal hyperglycaemia \nalong with its classic symptoms. The diagnostic values for diabetes mellitus and other \ncategories of hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 4.\nUsing fasting plasma glucose may not be equivalent to or as accurate as the use of an \noral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in identifying individuals with diabetes.

Also, patients diagnosed with diabetes based solely on \nthe fasting glucose level tend to have a different phenotype from those identified based \nsolely on the 2-hour OGTT glucose value [2,21,22].\nClassification\nThe classification of diabetes mellitus has evolved considerably over time, taking into \naccount recent advances in the diabetes field. The classification is now primarily based \non the etiology (causes) of the disease, rather than its treatment (Figure 2). The revised \nclassification encompasses both clinical stages and etiological types of hyperglycaemia \nand results from improved understanding of the causes of diabetes mellitus [21].\nThe clinical staging reflects that diabetes mellitus, regardless of its etiology, \nprogresses through several clinical stages during its natural history. Individuals can move \nfrom one stage to another in either direction [21]. The severity of glycaemia may change \nover time depending on the extent of the underlying disease processes.

In some individuals with type 2 diabetes, \nadequate glycaemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise and/or oral \nagents. These individuals, therefore, do not require insulin and may even revert to IGT \nor normoglycaemia. Other individuals require insulin for adequate glycaemic control \nbut can survive without it. These individuals, by definition, have some residual insulin \nsecretion. Individuals with extensive \u00df-cell destruction, and therefore no residual insulin \nsecretion, require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can \neven regress (e.g. with weight reduction), progress (e.g. with weight gain), or stay the \nsame [21].\nTerminology\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 (requiring insulin for survival) and \ntype 2 (may or may not require insulin for metabolic control). It is recommended that the \nterms insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, \nand their acronyms IDDM and NIDDM, no longer be used.

Type 1 includes those \ncases attributable to an autoimmune process, as well as those with \u00df-cell destruction for \nwhich neither etiology nor pathogenesis is known (idiopathic). It does not include those \nforms of \u00df-cell destruction or failure to which specific causes can be assigned (e.g. cystic \nfibrosis, mitochondrial defect, etc.) [1,2,21,23].\nType 2 includes the common major form of diabetes mellitus which results from \ndefect(s) in insulin secretion, almost always with a major contribution from insulin \nresistance. It has been argued that a lean phenotype 2 diabetes mellitus in adults found in \nthe Indian sub-continent may be very distinct from the more characteristic form of type \n2 found in Caucasians. Not enough information is available, however, to characterize \nsuch subjects separately [21].\nA recent international meeting reviewed the evidence for, and characteristics of, \ndiabetes mellitus in under-nourished individuals. While it appears that malnutrition may \ninfluence the expression of several types of diabetes, the evidence that diabetes can be \ncaused by malnutrition or protein deficiency per se is not convincing. Therefore, it was \nrecommended that the class \u2018malnutrition-related diabetes\u2019 (MRDM) be deleted. The \nformer subtypes of MRDM, protein-deficient pancreatic diabetes (PDPD or PDDM), \nmay be considered as a malnutrition-modulated or -modified form of diabetes mellitus \nfor which more studies are needed. The other former sub-type of MRDM, fibrocalculous \npancreatic diabetes (FCPD), is now classified as a disease of the exocrine pancreas, \nfibrocalculous pancreatopathy, which may lead to diabetes mellitus. The class impaired \nglucose regulation (IGT) is classified as a stage of impaired glucose regulation, since it \ncan be observed in any hyperglycaemic disorder, and is itself not diabetes. A clinical stage \nof IFG was introduced to classify individuals who have fasting glucose values above the \nnormal range, but below that diagnostic of diabetes. The term gestational diabetes was \nretained, but now encompasses the groups formerly classified as gestational impaired \nglucose tolerance (GIGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [21,22].\nImpaired glucose regulation\nIGT and/or impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) refer to a stage that is intermediate \nbetween normoglycaemia and diabetes and they represent risk categories for future \ndevelopment of diabetes mellitus [21,23]. The risk of diabetes is increased in persons \nwith IGT. About one third of IGT subjects develop type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the annual \nincidence rate ranges from 2% to 10% per year [21,22] depending on the population and \nmajor risk factors. In addition, the prevalence of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities \nis significantly higher in persons with IGT compared to persons with normal glucose \ntolerance, and cardiovascular mortality is higher [23]. Although there are no published \nestimates of the overall worldwide prevalence of IGT, it is thought to be higher than \nthat of diabetes at around 200 million persons. Therefore, any decision on screening and",

This is \nthe ratio between IGT prevalence and diabetes mellitus prevalence, and might indicate \nthe potential for future increase in type 2 prevalence. A high epidemicity index indicates \nthe beginning of an epidemic and is mostly seen in developing countries. Therefore, \nit is a big issue for developing countries whether to do something about IGT. The \nvalues for IFG are a fasting plasma glucose concentration of \u22656.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL)\n(whole blood 5.6 mmol/L, 100 mg/dL), but <7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) (whole blood \n6.1 mmol/L, 110 mg/dL). If an OGTT is performed, some individuals with IFG will \nhave IGT. If resources allow, WHO recommends that all those with IFG have an OGTT \nto exclude the diagnosis of diabetes. \nIndividuals who meet criteria for IGT or IFG may be euglycaemic in their daily lives \nas shown by normal or near-normal glycated haemoglobin levels. IGT and IFG are not \nclinical entities in their own right, but rather risk categories for future diabetes and/or \ncardiovascular disease. They can occur as an intermediate stage in any of the disease \nprocesses. IGT is often associated with the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance \nsyndrome). IGT may not be directly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular \ndisease, but rather may serve as an indicator or marker of enhanced risk by virtue of \nits correlation with the other elements of the metabolic syndrome. Self-evidently, those \nindividuals with IGT manifest glucose intolerance only when challenged with an oral \nglucose load.\nNormoglycaemia\nA fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of <6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) has \nbeen chosen as \u201cnormal\u201d. Although this choice is arbitrary, such values have been \nobserved in people with proven normal glucose tolerance; however, others with fasting \nglucose values <6.1 mmol/L may have IGT if an OGTT is performed. Fasting glucose \nvalues above this level are associated with a progressively greater risk of developing \nmicrovascular and macrovascular complications.\nIn addition, the pathological or etiological process that often leads to diabetes \nmellitus begins, and may be recognizable, in some subjects who have normal glucose \ntolerance. Recognition of these processes at any early stage may be useful if progression \nto more advanced phases can be prevented. Conversely, effective treatment, or \noccasionally the natural history of some forms of diabetes mellitus, may result in reversal \nof hyperglycaemia to a state of normoglycaemia [21\u201323].",

An individual with a type 1 process may be metabolically \nnormal before the disease is clinically manifest, but the process of \u00df-cell destruction \ncan be detected. Type 1 is usually characterized by the presence of anti-glutamic acid \ndecarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, islet cell or insulin antibodies which identify the \nautoimmune processes that lead to \u00df-cell destruction. In some subjects with this clinical \nform of diabetes, particularly non-Caucasians, no evidence of an autoimmune disorder is \ndemonstrable and these are classified idiopathic type 1. Etiological classification may be \npossible in some circumstances and not in others. Thus, the category of type 1 diabetes \ncan be identified if appropriate antibody determinations are performed. It is recognized \nthat such measurements may be available only in certain centres at present [23].\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nType 2 is the most common form of diabetes and is characterized by disorders of \ninsulin action and insulin secretion, either of which may be the predominant feature. \nBoth are usually present at the time that this form of diabetes is clinically manifest.

The definition applies irrespective of whether or not insulin is used \nfor treatment or whether the condition persists after pregnancy [21,23].

This clustering \nhas been labelled diversely as the metabolic syndrome, syndrome X, or the insulin \nresistance syndrome [21]. Epidemiological studies confirm that this syndrome occurs \ncommonly in a wide variety of ethnic groups including Caucasians, Afro-Americans, \nMexican-Americans, Asian Indians, Chinese, Australian Aborigines, Polynesians and \nMicronesians. In 1988, Dr Gerald Reaven focused attention on this cluster, naming it \nSyndrome X. Central obesity was not included in the original description, so the term \nmetabolic syndrome is now favoured. Alone, each component of the cluster conveys \nincreased cardiovascular disease risk, but as a combination they become much more \npowerful. This means that the management of persons with hyperglycaemia and other \nfeatures of the metabolic syndrome should focus not only on blood glucose control but \nalso include strategies to reduce the impact of other cardiovascular disease risk factors.\nThe metabolic syndrome with normal glucose tolerance identifies the subject as a \nmember of a group at very high risk of future diabetes. Thus, vigorous early management \nof the syndrome may have a significant impact on the prevention of both diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease, especially as it is well documented that the features of the metabolic \nsyndrome can be present for up to 10 years before glycaemic disorder is detected.\nBox 1.

The \nunderlying philosophy of screening has been that detection of diabetes in asymptomatic \nor minimally symptomatic individuals will result in effective treatment that may retard \nits progression and reduce the risk or the severity of complications, thus diminishing \npremature morbidity and mortality. This is brought into focus by the frequent presence of \nspecific complications at the time of clinical diagnosis and the estimate that on average \nsubjects had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 4\u20137 years prior to diagnosis [21,23].\nOver the years, opinions have changed frequently on the value of mass screening. \nInitially it was widely recommended, however at present it is recommended only for \nindividuals at risk or for epidemiological studies. This position is supported by many \nwell-designed screening programmes that have provided valuable information about \nthe prevalence of diabetes and IGT and their natural history in different populations. \nSuch data are essential for public health planning and provide information for continued \nevaluation of the current diagnostic criteria. Screening programmes can also improve \ncommunity awareness and pave the way for education about diabetes. \nImportant considerations in the design of an appropriate screening programme \ninclude [21,23]:\n\u2022 \nthe sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the screening test;\n\u2022 \nthe cost-effectiveness and resource requirements of the screening methodology and \nany necessary follow-up in the context of the anticipated positive detection rate;\n\u2022 \nthe definition of the target population to be screened;\n\u2022 \nthe provision of adequate and effective follow-up and care for individuals having \npositive test results.\nThere are however potential adverse effects of screening:\n\u2022 \npsychological stress, socioeconomic disadvantage and additional costs resulting \nfrom a false-positive test result;\n\u2022 \nfalse reassurance of a false-negative test result;\n\u2022 \nmedical complications of the screening test and the need for follow-up of positive \nscreenees;",

It must be emphasized that screening is only worthwhile if an \neffective intervention can be introduced to decrease the burden of the disease or prevent \nits complications. The current state of knowledge suggests that definitive proof of the \nvalue of screening is lacking, but evidence in its favour is steadily accumulating. The \napproach to screening that is adopted will depend on: \n\u2022 \nthe resources available; \n\u2022 \nthe potential disease burden;\n\u2022 \nthe risk factor distribution [1,2,21,22].\nScreening approaches\nA positive result in a screening test indicates only a high probability of the individual \nhaving the disease. The diagnosis of diabetes cannot be made on the basis of a single \nabnormal blood glucose value in an asymptomatic individual [21]. Confirmatory tests \nare always necessary for a definitive diagnosis to be made. There are three different \napproaches to screening: population, selective and opportunistic.\nPopulation screening [21]\nPopulation screening is worthwhile only for health care planning, for epidemiological \nresearch purposes or in high-prevalence populations. It can be used to identify individuals \nwith IGT provided the OGTT is employed. In most societies, it is ineffective in terms \nof cost and effort to screen low-risk individuals for type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as \nchildren and young adults.\nSelective screening [21]\nSelective screening is undertaken in groups known to have risk factors for \ndeveloping type 2 diabetes mellitus. In low-prevalence communities, an even more \nselective approach should be adopted.\nOpportunistic screening\nOpportunistic screening occurs when high-risk individuals present themselves to \nsome sector of the health care system. It is the most employed method and is highly cost-\neffective in that no resources are needed to organize the screening or call for subjects [21].",

Glycaemic \ngoals are based on evidence of what glucose levels constitute a risk for developing \ncomplications. It is, however, inappropriate to aggressively approach target glucose \nlevels when it may adversely affect the patient. Treatment goals must, therefore, be \nindividualized.\nThe goal of treatment of diabetes mellitus is to control blood glucose and ultimately \nprevent long-term complications, as shown by major diabetes studies like the United \nKingdom Prospective Diabetes Study group and Diabetes Control and Complications \nTrial [27\u201329]. Insulin therapy is necessary to control hyperglycaemia in type 1 diabetes \nmellitus. Provided hyperglycaemia is mild in type 2 diabetes, patients may be given \nat least a one month trial of diet, exercise and weight management in order to control \nhyperglycaemia. If this regimen does not lead to adequate blood glucose control, the \nphysician will need to prescribe oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents and/or insulin [29].\nObjectives of therapy\nThe main objectives of therapy for diabetes mellitus are:\n\u2022 \nto eliminate symptoms of hyperglycaemia;\n\u2022 \nto achieve optimum control;\n\u2022 \nto reduce or eliminate microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes \nmellitus;\n\u2022 \nto treat associated disorders;\n\u2022 \nto allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible.\nTherapy targets\nThe markers for diabetes mellitus control are blood glucose and HbA1c. The \nrecommended goals are shown in Table 13.\nHbA1c should be measured regularly in every patient (at three month intervals). \nLevels of HbA1c can be falsely altered (increased or decreased) in patients with",

It may be used when there is coexisting haemoglobin \nabnormalities falsely affecting the level of HbA1c (i.e. thalassemia), and during pregnancy \nfor early detection of deteriorations in glycaemic control [23].\nIt is now well established that multiple metabolic abnormalities associated with \ninsulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk, such as dyslipidaemia, obesity and \nhypertension, are already present at diagnosis. Consequently, treatment of hyperglycaemia \nalone cannot be expected to normalize the two to four-fold increased risk of cardiovascular \nmortality of these patients. In align with this, results of many intervention studies have \ndemonstrated marked benefit from antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet \ntherapy.

It is important to note, however, that sucrose must be substituted for \nother carbohydrates gram for gram and not simply added to the meal plan.

Saturated fat is the principal dietary determinant \nof low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol. Compared to non-diabetic subjects, diabetic \nsubjects have an increased risk of coronary heart disease with higher intakes of dietary \ncholesterol. \nLow-saturated fat (<10% of energy intake) and high-carbohydrate diets increase \npostprandial levels of plasma glucose and insulin, increase plasma triglycerides, and \nin some studies were shown to decrease plasma HDL cholesterol when compared to \nTreatment options \n39",

Ongoing nutrition self-management education \nand care need to be available for individuals with diabetes. In light of the existence of \ncomplexities of nutrition issues in diabetes, a qualified dietician knowledgeable and \nskilled in such issues is needed.\nExercise [30\u201335]\nExercise is extremely important in the management of diabetes because of its effect \non blood glucose and free fatty acids. Exercise burns calories and helps to control weight, \neases stress and tension, and maintains a feeling of well-being. In addition, regular \nexercise improves the body\u2019s response to insulin and may make oral anti-diabetic drugs \nand insulin more effective. It also promotes circulation, and lowers cholesterol and \ntriglyceride levels, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nPersons with diabetes should be encouraged to lead a normal life and participate in \nsports and exercise programmes. Generally they should not be excluded from physical \nactivities or games, unless there are complications and on the advice of a physician. The \nmain risk when exercising is hypoglycaemia, therefore blood glucose should be checked \nbefore exertion, and if appropriate, medication dosage may need to be reduced before \nexercise, or the individual may need to take an extra carbohydrate snack. Before starting \nany exercise programme, the health provider should do a thorough physical examination \nto find out whether or not it is safe for the patient to exercise.\nPharmacological therapy\nWhen lifestyle modification fails, therapeutic methods should be used that consist \nof the following options:\n\u2022 \ninsulin sensitizers\n\u2022 \ninsulin secretagogues\n\u2022 \n\u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors\n\u2022 \ninsulin.\nOral agents may counteract insulin resistance, improve \u00df-cell glucose sensing and \ninsulin secretion, or control the rate of intestinal glucose absorption.

An individually-based insulin regimen using a basal-bolus method \n(such as glargine for basal insulin and pre-meal lispro) is a consideration for patients who \ninsist on fasting. Close follow-up and frequent monitoring are essential.\nIt is not recommended for poorly-controlled type 2 patients to fast, because of \nthe risk of dehydration associated with hyperglycaemia. Patients controlled by diet \nalone can fast. Patients treated with oral agents may fast if allowed by their physician, \nhowever their regimen will need to be adjusted. Metformin and thiazolidinediones are \nthe preferred drugs, because they are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia \ncompared to insulin secretagogues.

A person with \nhypoglycaemia may feel nervous, shaky, weak, or sweaty. They may have a headache, \nblurred vision, and be very hungry. In more serious instances, they may become \nunconscious [21]. Taking small amounts of sugar or glucose-containing juice or food \nwill usually help the person feel better within 10\u201315 minutes. \nThe serious consequences of hypoglycaemia relate to its effects on the brain, \nincluding loss of cognitive function, seizure and coma. Prolonged or repeated episodes \nof hypoglycaemia may produce permanent brain damage, and the adrenergic response \nto the condition may be dangerous in people with cardiovascular disease.\nThe risk of hypoglycaemia is particularly high when tight glycaemic control is sought. \nIn the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [29] there was a three-fold increase in \nthe risk of severe hypoglycaemia, including coma and/or seizures, when intensive insulin \ntherapy was used. These episodes may occur with disproportionate frequency at night.\nPatients with autonomic neuropathy may have greater difficulty in detecting symptoms \nof hypoglycaemia and/or recovering from it. \u00df-adrenoreceptor blockers may also impair \ndetection of symptoms and/or recovery, and alcohol consumption may aggravate the risk \nof hypoglycaemia and impair recovery. Delayed or missed meals and increased physical \nactivity increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Oral hypoglycaemic agents, particularly \nsulfonylureas, may also induce hypoglycaemia.",

It accounts for 75% of diabetes-related deaths, a figure two to three times higher \nthan that in people without diabetes. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, some studies \nhave reported that the occurrence of clinical events related to coronary artery disease \nare four times higher in patients with diabetes [13,40]. Coronary and cerebrovascular \ndiseases are also two to three times more common, and post-infarction mortality higher. \nThese increases in atherosclerosis in diabetic individuals are seen in all populations, \nwhether the general incidence of atherosclerosis is high or low. In developing and rural \nsocieties, changes in lifestyle to a pattern similar to that of more industrialized and urban \nsocieties are often associated with a general increase in atherosclerosis.\nAlthough the largest numbers of diabetic ischaemic events occur in people with type \n2 diabetes mellitus, the risk of atherosclerosis is also high in type 1 and may be manifest \nat a young age. One feature unique to women with diabetes is the loss of protection from \natherosclerosis prior to menopause.\n \nHyperglycaemia may promote atherosclerosis by:\n\u2022 \nmodifications of lipoproteins (e.g. glycation of LDL)\n\u2022 \nglycation of arterial wall proteins\n\u2022 \nformation of advanced glycation end-products\n\u2022 \nstimulation of insulin secretion\n\u2022 \nstimulation of protein kinase C.\nHyperinsulinaemia has been shown to be independently associated with coronary \ndisease in men.

Its use is highly recommended.\nRetinopathy\nBackground\nDiabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in \nadults in many societies. Almost everyone with younger-onset type 1 diabetes will \ndevelop diabetic retinopathy after 20 years of the disease. At some time during their \nlives, 75% will develop the most severe stage, proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In \nolder-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus, almost 60% will develop diabetic retinopathy and \nat some time during their lives about 10% will develop proliferative retinopathy and \nabout 2% become blind. \nBoth younger- and older-onset diabetic people are at risk of developing another \nsight-threatening manifestation of diabetic retinopathy, namely macular oedema, a \nswelling of the central part of the retina. Epidemiological data also suggest that loss of \nvision due to open-angle glaucoma and cataract may be more common in people with \ndiabetes than in non-diabetics [21].\nWomen with known diabetes mellitus who are planning a pregnancy should have a \ndetailed examination and should be counselled about the potential risk of development \nand/or rapid progression of retinopathy during pregnancy.\nThere are two main factors that delay the discovery of diabetes eye complications.\n\u2022 \nPhysician factors:\n\u2212 \nfailure to dilate pupils on examination;\n\u2212 \npoor ophthalmoscopy skills;\n\u2212 \nlack of knowledge of the benefits of photocoagulation.\nChronic complications of diabetes  \n59",

Diabetic patients are 17 times as prone to kidney disease as \nnon-diabetic people. It is a multistage condition that requires several years to become \nclinically overt. The stages are as follows:\n\u2022 \nincipient (sub-clinical) nephropathy\n\u2022 \nclinical (or overt) nephropathy\n\u2022 \nadvanced nephropathy\n\u2022 \nend-stage renal disease.\nIncipient nephropathy is defined by a persistent increase in albumin excretion rate, \nreferred to as microalbuminuria without frank proteinuria. It is represented by an albumin \nexcretion rate of 20\u2013200 \u00b5g/minute (30\u2013300 mg/24 hours). Microalbuminuria may be \naccompanied by a rise in blood pressure. Clinical nephropathy is defined by the presence \nof persistent proteinuria, i.e. albumin secretion >200 \u00b5g/minute (>300 mg/24 hours), and \nis usually accompanied by hypertension. In advanced nephropathy there is a significant \ndecline in glomerular filtration rate and the appearance of symptoms of uraemia and/or \nnephrotic syndrome. End-stage renal disease necessitates dialysis or renal transplantation.\nWhile the cumulative risk of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus is \nabout 30%\u201340% after 25\u201330 years, it varies considerably in type 2 diabetes mellitus \ndepending on ethnic origin, and can be as low as 15% in some groups of European origin \nafter 25 years of disease.\nScreening strategies\nBlood pressure should be monitored at least annually in all patients with diabetes \nmellitus, and preferably twice a year.

Simple tools, such as the graduated \ntuning fork and standard monofilament, are useful for the semi-quantitative diagnostic \nevaluation of neuropathy. Wherever possible, diabetic patients who have significant \nvascular disease and ischaemia of the foot should have access to the modern investigative \ntechniques of Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography. Non-invasive angioplasty or \nsurgical arterial reconstruction should be performed if indicated. If angiography is to be \nperformed, special attention should be paid to patients with nephropathy, even in its early \nstages, since radiopaque dye administration can provoke renal deterioration. Appropriate \nhydration before the procedure is often necessary [21,22].\nIn the treatment of established foot ulcers, early local debridement and aggressive \nantibiotic therapy should be considered. For resistant foot ulcers, special plantar supports \nor castings should be provided. Patients need to understand the importance of adhering \nstrictly to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Every member of the diabetes care team \nshould understand and practice the principles of foot protection.\nA specialist foot-care team should be part of every comprehensive diabetes care \nservice.

In this event, training of non-\nspecialist health workers and simple direct instructions to patients themselves are likely \nto reduce the risk of serious tissue destruction. As with other diabetic complications, the \nfrequency of follow-up of foot complications will depend on their type and severity. For \ninstance, patients with plantar ulcers should be seen at short intervals (1\u20133 weeks); those \nwith loss of pain sensation but without local lesions may be seen every 3 months [23].",

While there is not yet conclusive evidence to suggest \nthat type 1 diabetes mellitus can be prevented, primary prevention of type 2 is possible. \nPrimary prevention has an impact by reducing both the need for diabetes care and the \nneed to treat diabetic complications [32,45].\nSecondary and tertiary preventions are key to reducing the risk of costly diabetic \ncomplications, as well as their associated disabilities. There is great potential for tertiary \nprevention in diabetes, especially with regard to blindness, limb amputation and adverse \npregnancy outcomes. Rehabilitation and special assistance are required for those who do \ndevelop disabling complications. Overall, action taken early in the course of diabetes is \nmore beneficial in terms of quality of life as well as being more cost-effective, especially \nif this action can prevent hospital admission.\nMany barriers exist at the prevention level, including:\n\u2022 \nlack of knowledge and awareness by individuals and communities;\n\u2022 \ninadequately trained personnel in the preventive health care field;\n\u2022 \ninadequate use of media for creating awareness for health education;\n\u2022 \nchanging of deeply-rooted lifestyles is very difficult;\n\u2022 \nsocial problems [45].\nPrimary prevention\nLifestyle changes aimed at weight control and increased physical activity are \nimportant objectives in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The benefits of \nreducing body weight and increasing physical activity are not confined to type 2 diabetes, \nthey also play a role in reducing heart disease and high blood pressure. Lifestyle is the \nkey to reversing these trends. Ministries of health, other ministries and the private sector \nneed to have a commitment to a healthy lifestyle in order to reduce the risk of type 2 \ndiabetes and its complications developing in populations. The management of high blood \npressure and raised blood lipids is equally important [45,46].",

The Da Quing Study \nfrom China [30] showed that diet and exercise alone or in combination in patients with \nIGT led to a 31%\u201346% reduction in the risk of diabetes mellitus over a follow-up period \nof 6 years. A study conducted in Finland by Tuomilehto et al. [33] in individuals with \nIGT showed that the incidence of type 2 diabetes was 23% in the control group compared \nto 11% in the intervention group (exercise and diet modifications) over a 4-year period.\nThe Diabetes Prevention Programme Research Group [34], randomly assigned \n3234 non-diabetic subjects (mean age 51 years, mean body mass index 34.0 kg/m2) \nwith elevated fasting and post-load plasma glucose concentrations to either placebo, \nmetformin (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle modification programme. The objective \nwas to achieve at least a 7% weight loss and at least 150 minutes of physical activity per \nweek. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years \nin the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively.\nCommunity awareness and primary prevention\nThe above studies highlight the importance of physical inactivity and unhealthy \ndiets as strong risk factors for diabetes mellitus. A reasonable exercise programme and \na modest amount of weight loss led to a marked decrease in diabetes incidence by more \nthan 50%.\nDue to the importance of the prevention of type 2 diabetes and its complications, \nEastern Mediterranean countries should give priority to the development of community-\nbased healthy lifestyle programmes that focus on:\n\u2022 \nmaintaining a \u2018healthy\u2019 weight [35];\n\u2022 \nan active lifestyle which includes regular physical activity;\n\u2022 \nearly identification of subjects at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n\u2022 \nidentifying subjects at high risk of noncommunicable diseases, such as hypertension, \ndiabetes and heart disease; \n\u2022 \noptimal maternal nutrition and weight maintenance;\n\u2022 \nintroduction of healthy lifestyle programmes in the early school years.

Secondary prevention is the key to reducing the risk \nof costly and disabling diabetic complications. There is now conclusive evidence that \ngood control of blood glucose levels can substantially reduce these complications. The \nUnited Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study group [27,28] have proven that the risk of \ndiabetic complications can be reduced significantly in people with type 2 diabetes. It \nshowed that: \n\u2022 \nwith good glucose control, diabetes-related complications (such as blindness, stroke, \nrenal disease, limb amputation and heart attack) can be reduced by 12%.\n\u2022 \nwith good blood pressure control, diabetes-related complications can be reduced by \n24%, and diabetes-related deaths by up to 32%.\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [29] in the USA had similar findings \nfor blood glucose control in type 1 diabetes.\nTherefore, action taken early in the course of diabetes is more beneficial in terms \nof quality of life and is more cost-effective, especially if this action can prevent hospital \nadmission. The management of high blood pressure and raised blood lipids (fats) is \nequally important. \nTertiary prevention\nTertiary prevention of diabetes includes every action taken to prevent or delay \nthe consequences of diabetic complications, such as blindness, foot amputation and \nadverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies for tertiary prevention involve prevention of \nthe development of complications by strict metabolic control, education and effective \ntreatment. They also involve screening for early stages of complications, when \nintervention and treatment are generally more effective. Such screening for complications \naimed at early intervention and treatment has proved successful and may be even more \neffective than strategies aimed at preventing the development of complications. As an \nexample, the introduction of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of retinopathy has \nled to a dramatic decrease in diabetes-related blindness. Rehabilitation of persons with \ndiabetic complications is essential since many individuals with diabetes may develop \ndisabling complications with high associated costs.",

Sowers\nABSTRACT: Epidemiological studies have documented that insulin resistance and diabetes not only constitute metabolic \nabnormalities but also predispose to hypertension, vascular stiffness, and associated cardiovascular disease. Meanwhile, \nexcessive arterial stiffness and impaired vasorelaxation, in turn, contribute to worsening insulin resistance and the \ndevelopment of diabetes. Molecular mechanisms promoting hypertension in diabetes include inappropriate activation of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, mitochondria dysfunction, excessive oxidative \nstress, and systemic inflammation. This review highlights recent studies which have uncovered new underlying mechanisms \nfor the increased propensity for the development of hypertension in association with diabetes. These include enhanced \nactivation of epithelial sodium channels, alterations in extracellular vesicles and their microRNAs, abnormal gut microbiota, \nand increased renal sodium-glucose cotransporter activity, which collectively predispose to hypertension in association with \ndiabetes. This review also covers socioeconomic factors and currently recommended blood pressure targets and related \ntreatment strategies in diabetic patients with hypertension.\nKey Words:\u2002 blood pressure \u25fc cardiovascular diseases \u25fc insulin resistance \u25fc obesity \u25fc vascular stiffness\nI\nndividuals with metabolic disorders, including insulin \nresistance, diabetes, and cardiometabolic syndrome, \nhave a high prevalence of hypertension, a powerful risk \nfactor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney disease, \nstroke, and microvascular complications.1 Not only is \nhypertension more common in patients with diabetes but \nalso diabetes is also more common in hypertensives than \nin the general population. Therefore, there is a chicken-\negg relationship between hypertension and diabetes \n(Figure\u00a01).2 To this point, hypertension occurs in 50% to \n80% of patients with type 2 diabetes, who make up over \n90% of the diabetic population versus \u224830% of patients \nwith type 1 diabetes who develop hypertension.3,4 That \nhypertension is especially common in type 2 diabetes \nsuggests that insulin resistance may play an important \nrole in the pathogenesis of this hypertension. Addition-\nally, a prospective cohort study of 12\u2009550 adults 45 to \n64 years old found that type 2 diabetes was almost 2.5 \ntimes as likely to develop in patients with hypertension \nas in those with normal blood pressure.3\u20135 Data from \nthe ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), \nthe CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development \nin Young Adults), and the Framingham Heart Study off-\nspring cohort in 10\u2009893 participants showed that hyper-\ntension is a risk factor for diabetes and often precedes \nthe development of diabetes.4 Our understanding of \nmechanisms by which insulin resistance contributes to \nthe development of hypertension in type 2 diabetes is \nevolving. This review focuses on basic mechanisms and \nenvironmental factors involved in promoting hyperten-\nsion in diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes. It also dis-\ncusses approaches for the prevention and contemporary \nstrategies to lessen CVD and renal disease in patients \nwith diabetes with hypertension.\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF INSULIN RESISTANCE \nAND DIABETES-RELATED HYPERTENSION\nThere are fundamental differences in type 1 and type 2 \ndiabetes-related hypertension.

Epidemiologi-\ncal studies indicate that there is a very high incidence of \nhypertension, including increases in resistant hyperten-\nsion and associated CVD in patients with type 2 diabe-\ntes.1 In the Framingham Heart Study, type 2 diabetes was \nassociated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of hyperten-\nsion, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarc-\ntion.8 A recent analysis of the Framingham data further \nshowed that the population with hypertension at the time \nof diabetes diagnosis had higher rates of mortality for \nall causes and CVD events compared with normotensive \npersons with diabetes.9 These data support a strong rela-\ntionship between coexistent type 2 diabetes and hyper-\ntension and associated increases in CVD.\nOur understanding of the role of insulin resis-\ntance in the development of elevated blood pres-\nsures is evolving. A clinic observation in 1966 from \n19 patients without diabetes with essential hyperten-\nsion found that these patients had significantly higher \nplasma insulin concentrations than a normotensive \ncontrol group.10 Approximately 50% of patients with \nhypertension are insulin resistant, and this defect in \ninsulin metabolic actions increasingly appears to con-\ntribute to development of hypertension and associated \nCVD.11 The Framingham Offspring Study investigated \nthe relationship between insulin sensitivity and the \n4-year incidence of hypertension and blood pressure \nprogression in 1933 nonhypertensive participants. \nThis analysis showed that the association between \ninsulin sensitivity/resistance and hypertension was \nattenuated but remained statistically significant after \nadjustment for increases in body mass index.12 These \nfindings suggest that obesity and insulin resistance \nare inextricably linked in promotion of hypertension \nincluding that in type 2 diabetes.\nGENDER, RACE, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND \nSOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS IMPACTING \nPERSONS WITH DIABETES AND \nHYPERTENSION\nGender and race impact the relationship between insu-\nlin resistance and diabetes-related hypertension.13 In \nnondiabetic individuals the prevalence of hyperten-\nsion is higher in men as compared to women until the \nage of 64 years when the gap closes and prevalence \nin females reaches that of males.9 Interestingly, women \nwith impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes have a \nhigher incidence of hypertension than men with equiva-\nlent impairment in glucose homeostasis.14 Additionally, \nNonstandard Abbreviations and Acronyms\nAkt\t\nprotein kinase B\nARIC\t\n\u0007Atherosclerosis Risk in \nCommunities\nAT-1R\t\n\u0007angiotensin type 1 receptor\nCARDIA\t\n\u0007Coronary Artery Risk \nDevelopment in Young Adults\nCOVID-19\t\ncoronavirus disease 2019\nCREDENCE\t\n\u0007Canagliflozin and Renal \nEvents in Diabetes With \nEstablished Nephropathy \nClinical Evaluation\nCVD\t\ncardiovascular disease\nDECLARE-TIMI 58\t\n\u0007Dapagliflozin Effect on \nCardiovascular Events-\nThrombolysis in Myocardial \nInfarction 58\nEMPA-REG OUTCOME\t\u0007Empagliflozin Cardiovas-\ncular Outcome Event Trial \nin Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \nPatients\neNOS\t\n\u0007endothelial nitric oxide \nsynthase\nET-1\t\nendothelin-1\nEVs\t\nextracellular vesicles\nEXSCEL\t\n\u0007Exenatide Study of Cardio-\nvascular Event Lowering\nGLP-1\t\nglucagon-like peptide 1\nmiRs\t\nmicroRNAs\nMR\t\nmineralocorticoid receptor\nPI3K\t\n\u0007phosphatidylinositide \n3-kinase\nRAAS\t\n\u0007renin-angiotensin-aldoste-\nrone system\nROS\t\nreactive oxygen species\nSGK-1\t\n\u0007serum and glucocorticoid \nregulated kinase 1\nSGLT2\t\n\u0007sodium-glucose cotrans-\nporter 2\nSNS\t\n\u0007sympathetic nervous system\nSUSTAIN-6\t\n\u0007Trial to Evaluate Car-\ndiovascular and Other \nLong-Term Outcomes With \nSemaglutide in Subjects \nWith Type 2 Diabetes\nTLR\t\nToll-like receptor",

The high incidence \nof overweight/obesity is closely related to overconsump-\ntion of inexpensive and palatable high fat and high refined \ncarbohydrate diets.21 Indeed, a positive association even \nexists between a progressive increase in body mass \nindex within the normal and overweight range and the \nrisk of hypertension and CVD.22 Related to this, data from \nthe Framingham Heart Study showed that excess body \nweight accounted for appropriate 26% of cases of hyper-\ntension in men and 28% in women.23 In addition, obese \nchildren were at \u22483-fold higher risk for hypertension than \nnonobese children.24 Increased visceral adipose tissue and \nabdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue are especially \nassociated with obesity-related metabolic and vascular \ncomplications.25 For instance, in a study of 382 diabetic \nindividuals, higher visceral adipose tissue, independent of \nbody mass index, was associated with a higher prevalence \nof dyslipidemia and increased the risk for hypertension, \natherosclerosis, and CVD.26 Mechanistically, proinflamma-\ntory adipokines, including leptin and aldosterone, released \nfrom visceral fat may promote systemic and vascular insu-\nlin resistance and inflammation, impaired relaxation and \nvascular stiffness and development of hypertension.27\nFigure 1.

DOI: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.17981\nJia and Sowers\nDiabetes in Hypertension\nEXCESSIVE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IS \nRELATED TO INSULIN RESISTANCE AND \nDIABETES-INDUCED HYPERTENSION\nWhile hypertension induces vascular remodeling and can \nlead to arterial stiffness, insulin resistance and diabetes \ncan also promote arterial stiffening and subsequent hyper-\ntension and CVD. An increase in the augmentation index, \na measure of arterial stiffness, was independently associ-\nated with all-cause mortality and a composite end point of \nCVD and diabetes-related death in a prospective cohort of \npatients with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that arterial stiff-\nness predicts both all-cause mortality and the composite \nend point of CVD and diabetes-related death in patients \nwith type 1 diabetes.28 Recent data also suggest that the \nhyperinsulinemia accompanying insulin resistance is an \nindependent risk factor for arterial stiffening.21 Another \nstudy investigated the relationships between arterial stiff-\nness indexes and serum insulin and glucose tolerance \nmeasurements in a biracial population of 4701 men and \nwomen aged 45 to 64. Patients with borderline abnormal \nglucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes had stiffer arteries \nthan their counterparts with normal glucose tolerance.29 It \nwas suggested that interactive effects of elevated glucose \nand insulin may have a synergistic impact on arterial stiff-\nness and play an important role in the early pathophysiology \nof hypertension and CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes.30\nMECHANISMS IN INSULIN RESISTANCE/\nDIABETES-INDUCED HYPERTENSION\nWhile diabetic nephropathy is the major driving factor for \nhypertension in type 1 diabetes, inappropriate activation \nof the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and \nsympathetic nervous system (SNS), mitochondria dysfunc-\ntion, oxidative stress, inflammation, abnormal release of \nextracellular vesicles (EVs), and related microRNAs (miRs), \nas well as dysregulation of gut microbiota and renal SGLT2 \n(sodium-glucose cotransporter 2), are emerging as under-\nlying mechanisms in the development of insulin resistance \nand type 2 diabetes-induced hypertension (Figure\u00a01).\nInappropriate Activation of RAAS and SNS\nActivation of the systemic and tissue RAAS in states of \ninsulin resistance, obesity, and associated hyperglycemia \nplays an important role in the development of hyperten-\nsion. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that insulin \nresistance and hyperglycemia induce systemic RAAS \nactivation in association with increased vascular resis-\ntance and arterial pressure.31 Inhibition of the RAAS with \nangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT-1R (angio-\ntensin type 1 receptor) blockers, and MR (mineralocor-\nticoid receptor) antagonists reduce the incidence of \nhypertension in patients with diabetes.32,33 Inappropriate \nactivation of the RAAS observed in insulin resistance and \ndiabetes is likely to impair insulin signaling which con-\ntributes to development of hypertension (Figure\u00a0 2). To \nthis point, angiotensin II and aldosterone increase serine \nphosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins, \nleading to decreased activity of insulin downstream sig-\nnaling pathways in PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase) \nand Akt (protein kinase B), which leads to reduced eNOS \n(endothelial nitric oxide synthase) activation by insulin \nand reduced nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilation.1\nThe hyperinsulinemia associated with metabolic insu-\nlin resistance stimulates production of the vasoconstric-\ntor ET-1 (endothelin-1) via a mitogen-activated protein \nkinase-dependent signaling pathway (Figure\u00a0 2). This \ncontributes to vascular insulin resistance, excessive arte-\nrial stiffening, and ultimately hypertension.1 Recently, we \nfound that hyperinsulinemia and aldosterone increase \nactivity of the endothelial epithelial sodium channel which \nleads to arterial stiffness and hypertension.21 Related to \nthis, both angiotensin II and aldosterone enhance SGK-1 \n(serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1) to induce \nendothelial epithelial sodium channel activation leading \nto reduction of endothelium eNOS activity, NO produc-\ntion, and the development of arterial stiffening (Figure\u00a02).\nInappropriate activation of the SNS is often a feature of \nhypertension associated with obesity and insulin resistance. \nIn this regard, overactivity of the SNS induced, in part, by insu-\nlin resistance and hyperinsulinemia has been documented \nin both animal models34,35 and hypertensive individuals.36,37 \nMoreover, the presence of hypertension appears to further \nelevate the SNS responses to insulin.37 Increased sympa-\nthetic tone induces stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors \nwhich promotes insulin resistance through the activation \nof serine/threonine kinases which blunts insulin metabolic \nsignaling.38 Elevated blood pressure in response to hyper-\ninsulinemia may also be mediated by changes in baroreflex \nsensitivity39 and by central nervous system hypertension \npromoting effects of hyperinsulinemia.34\nRole of Mitochondria Dysfunction and \nExcessive Oxidative Stress\nThe metabolic actions of insulin are dependent on normal \nmitochondria function, which plays a key role in energy \nhomeostasis by metabolizing nutrients and producing \nATP and cellular energy generation. Insulin resistance \nand diabetes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunc-\ntion, characterized by reduced energy production.40 For \ninstance, defects in mitochondria biogenesis and dynam-\nics in endothelial cells have detrimental consequences \non their bioenergetic supply and these abnormalities \ncontribute to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension.40\nMitochondrial are also a major source of intracellular \nreactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased ROS are \ninvolved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, diabe-\ntes, and hypertension.40 Related to this, almost all vascular",

In diabetes excessive ROS production can induce \ndamage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to mitochon-\ndrial dysfunction. NADPH oxidases are also an important \nsource of excess ROS production in the vasculature in \ninsulin resistance and hypertension.41 Insulin resistance \nand diabetes are associated with increased activation of \nvascular NADPH oxidases thereby inducing excessive \nROS production which causes an imbalance between \nendothelium-derived relaxing factors and endothelium-\nderived contractile factors leading to associated increases \nin vascular tone. Excessive ROS reduce NO production \nand increase destruction of NO leading to diminished bio-\navailable NO, which contributes to arterial stiffness and \nhypertension. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction and \noxidative stress are likely important instigators of hyper-\ntension in states of insulin resistance and diabetes.\nInflammation\nSystemic and cardiovascular inflammation are important \ncontributors to the development of insulin resistance, dia-\nbetes, and hypertension. For instance, enhanced TLR (Toll-\nlike receptor)-mediated proinflammatory signaling induces \nactivation of nuclear factor kappa B and c-Jun N-terminal \nkinase that promote release of inflammatory cytokines, \nincluding tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, vas-\ncular cell adhesion molecular 1, and monocyte chemoat-\ntractant protein-1.1 These proinflammatory cytokines can \nimpair insulin metabolic signaling and reduce insulin-\nmediated NO production, leading to arterial stiffness and \nhypertension. Furthermore, systemic and tissue inflamma-\ntion are strongly related to visceral obesity. Typically, adi-\npose tissue is composed of a variety of immune cells, such \nas macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, T lymphocytes, \nmast cells, and neutrophils.42 To this point, macrophages \nare an important driver of adipose tissue inflammation and \nassociated metabolic disorders and hypertension.\nPerivascular adipose tissue, a special local deposit of adi-\npose tissue surrounding blood vessels, provides mechani-\ncal protection and modulates blood vessel tone.42 In the \nsetting of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, \nincreased NADPH oxidase-derived ROS and proinflamma-\ntory adipokines from perivascular adipose tissue contrib-\nute to vascular insulin resistance and impaired relaxation.42 \nData from the Framingham Offspring and Third Genera-\ntion cohorts support the notion that altered perivascular \nadipose tissue volume is linked with higher thoracic and \nabdominal aortic dimensions and increased stiffness even \nafter adjusting for sex, age, and CVD risk factors, including \nbody mass index and visceral adipose tissue volume.43\nAbnormal Release of EVs and Their miRs \nContribute to Insulin Resistance, Diabetes, and \nHypertension\nThere is emerging evidence that diabetes and hyper-\ntension are associated with abnormal release of EVs, \nwhich normally mediate cell-to-cell communications.44 \nFor instance, the patients with hypertension often have \nincreased circulating endothelial and platelet EVs,45,46 as \nwell as urinary endothelial microparticles.47 Moreover, the \nintraperitoneal of plasma exosomes from spontaneously \nhypertensive rats induced an increases of systolic blood \npressure in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats,48 suggesting \nthat abnormal circulating and urinary EVs may be bio-\nmarkers associated with the pathogenesis and progres-\nsion of hypertension. Importantly, EVs contain various \nmolecular constituents, including proteins, mRNA, and \nFigure 2.

Recent data suggest that exo-\nsomal miRs are involved in activation of the RAAS, oxi-\ndative stress, and inflammation, and these abnormalities \nmay induce vascular dysfunction and hypertension.49,50 \nIndeed, increased levels of miR-223, miR-320, miR-501, \nmiR504, and miR1 and decreased levels of miR-16, \nmiR-133, miR-492, and miR-373 have been related to \ninsulin resistance and diabetes-related hypertension.51 \nThese data suggest that exosomal miRs are important \nbiomarkers in patients with insulin resistance, diabetes, \nand hypertension.\nGut Microbiota\nEmerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota \nchanges contribute to insulin resistance, diabetes, \nhypertension, and CVD. In this regard, the gut flora has \nabout 100 trillion micro-organism species, and these \nbacteria modulate normal metabolic activities and \nphysiological functions. For instance, the cecal bacte-\nria from the phylum Bacteroidetes that are regarded as \ngood bacteria are reduced in obesity, and this reduc-\ntion is accompanied by a proportional increase in bad \nbacteria with the phylum Firmicutes.52 These deleteri-\nous changes in gut bacteria have also been observed \nin insulin resistant ob/ob53 and db/db54 type 2 diabetic \nmice. A recent study provides evidence that gut microbi-\nota may have a causal role in insulin resistance and type \n2 diabetes.55 In that study, mice receiving a transplant \nfrom an obese twin donor developed increased adi-\nposity compared with those receiving transplants from \nlean twin donors. Moreover, cohousing mice harboring \nan obese twin\u2019s microbiota with mice containing the \nlean co-twin\u2019s microbiota prevented the development \nof increased body mass and obesity-associated meta-\nbolic phenotypes in obese cage mates.55 Furthermore, \noral administration of good bacteria improves the gut \nbarrier dysfunction and metabolic disorders in obese \nand type 2 diabetic mice,56 suggesting that transmis-\nsibility of intestinal microbes and the metabolic pheno-\ntype are closely linked and that it is possible to impact \nobesity, insulin resistance, and associated hypertension \nby modulating the composition of the microbiota. To \nthis point, one study showed that gut microbiota can \nproduce norepinephrine, thereby promoting vascular \nconstriction and hypertension in the insulin resistant \nstate.57 Moreover, Enterococcus faecalis directly contrib-\nutes to hypertension and renal injury by interfering lipid \nmetabolism.58 Thus, alterations of gut microbiota pro-\nvide a new mechanism in exploring insulin resistance \nand diabetes-induced hypertension.\nContribution of SGLT2 to Insulin Resistance, \nDiabetes, and Hypertension\nGlucose homeostasis is impaired in individuals with insulin \nresistant associated diabetes, in part, as a consequence \nof an increased capacity to absorb renal glucose and via \nproximal tubule SGLT2, which is responsible for proximal \ntubule reabsorption of about 90% of filtered glucose.59 \nThe glucose reabsorption in the kidney normally has a \nmaximal threshold corresponding to glucose plasma lev-\nels. However, individuals with insulin resistance and type \n2 diabetes have a higher threshold due to the upregu-\nlation of SGLT2 that increases proximal tubule glucose \nand sodium absorption, thereby contributing to hyperten-\nsion and related CVD.59 Recent large, randomized, pla-\ncebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that treatment \nwith SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduces hypertension \nand CVD events and prevent the progression of renal \ndysfunction in individuals with diabetes.60\nRECENT THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH \nDIABETES AND HYPERTENSION\nThe ADA 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines suggest that \nnonpharmacological measures, such as weight loss, reg-\nular physical activity, and limitation of fat and total energy \nintake, should always be part of any blood pressure-\nlowering treatment as it is the cornerstone of preven-\ntive therapy in patients with diabetes with hypertension.61 \nRAAS blocker may slow progression to kidney failure and \nCVD, and thus angiotensin II\u2013converting enzyme inhibi-\ntors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are appropriate \nfor initial therapy for managing hypertension in patients \nwith diabetes. Many patients with diabetes with hyperten-\nsion manifest a resistant form of hypertension requiring \nthe addition of MR antagonists to their combination ther-\napy.62,63 This includes nonsteroidal MR antagonists (ie, \nFineronone) which has recently been shown to reduce \nCVD events as well as reducing advancement of renal \ndisease in patients with diabetes and kidney disease.64,65\nIn recent years, newer antihyperglycemic medica-\ntions, such as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) agonists \nand SGLT2 inhibitors, have been found to lower blood \npressure as well improving glucose metabolism. For \ninstance, exenatide, an analog of GLP-1, was evaluated \nin the EXSCEL trial (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascu-\nlar Event Lowering) clinical trial in patients with diabetes \nfor 5 years, and exenatide reduced systolic blood pres-\nsure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.66 Consistent \nwith these data, Semaglutide, injected once-weekly at 2 \ndoses (0.5 or 1.0 mg) for 104 weeks in the SUSTAIN-6 \n(Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term \nOutcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 \nDiabetes), reduced blood pressure, nonfatal myocardial \ninfarction, and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes at \nhigh CVD risk.67",
